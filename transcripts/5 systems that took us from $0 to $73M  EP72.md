# 5 systems that took us from $0 to $73M | EP72
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRkQjpIWOEc

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the five systems that took us from 0 to $73 million in total cash collected. I'm going to walk through each one of these systems and their two subsystems. And I promise you that if you watch this entire video, you are going to learn which one of these systems is currently holding you back from massive scale. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done over 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No guru, no course, no nothing. Everything on the channel I'm sharing did work for us, did not work for us, or is something we are actively doing. And I'm doing all of this to find top talent, opportunity, and build a network of cool people doing cool So, let's get into it. So, to start it off, we're going to think of everything like a funnel. And we are going to start with our marketing system. Okay? So, for us, everything that we have run almost exclusively has been paid. So, we're going to go through the different channels and we are going to go through the different funnels that we have used. Okay? This is day 72, I believe, of me making videos in a row every single day where I have tons of videos on the channel where I break these down immensely. But we're just going to talk through the overall systems. So, thinking of everything as a funnel, the first thing you need to do is get people to talk to. Okay? So, before you can sell them, before you can service them, before you can charge them a dollar, you need to get them to you. Okay? So, for us, the channels that we used almost exclusively was Meta. Okay? Now, it's easiest one in my opinion to get on to. A lot of people now do organic and these other we did exclusively paid. So for us paid on meta was the easiest and then we also did um Google and you know on the back end for branded search which you can look up how to do branded search basically for your keywords because once you start running enough paid or even organic on enough channels people are searching your name and you want to be the first one to pop up. So these are the core channels we went into and then the different funnel types. For us the first 71 million of this was using a VSSL opt-in funnel. So, that's just going to be your name, email, uh, to opt in for a free training. They're going to watch a VSSL. After the X amount into the VSSL, they're going to click a button to apply to get on the phone, and then they are going to book a call, get on the phone, and purchase. Okay, so we optimized everything for a call funnel that was frontloaded with an opt-in and VSSL. As this has transitioned and changed for this last couple million and what we're building for this next scale, we're trying to take this to a couple hundred million a year. Uh, first stop is 100. But for us, we have diversified and have multiple funnels now like low ticket ascension. We have a direct to VSSL. So basically headline VSSL application to book a call and other things. Channels for us though have stayed consistent. We are talking about leaning in more into organic and I'm kind of on the prowl right now to find somebody to do this for us because we have so much content but really for us first click has almost never been uh from organic videos and almost exclusively from paid. All of our organic acts as like retargeting piece of it. So once you have people in the system and I'm going to go back through this and we're going to go through iterations. Once you have them in there is your sales system. So for us everything for us has been setters and closers. And actually again back to that first 71 million was just closers. So we built a very large team of closers. Um we've had upwards of like 354 at one time which isn't necessarily the large part but we have had hundreds in general because we've been running this for years. So we have had iterations of this. We've had different offers. And that's where this kind of comes in between all three of these is a really big thing which is your offer. So for us, which we'll get into in this next one, at one time we were selling kind of a mid-t product over the phone and then we went to selling something higher ticket which develops a different type of closer and requires a different type of closer who can sell that. So there is basically the skill of the person to sell something and then there's like the belief in the product around it. So for us when we started we brought closers in that were customers of the product. So when we did that, we brought them, we would basically post inside the group. We would hire them from there and then teach them the skill of how to sell, teach them the CRM, the tech skills to do the actual job. But they already came with such a high belief level that it just worked. So I think a lot of people when starting can do this. I know a lot of people who do this with their actual coaches inside their program, their community managers. Um they're your initial customers. They get the result. They have the highest belief. Um and it's definitely a really good way. Setters was such an untapped thing that everyone talked about that we never did and has now benefited us massively. So setters sit everywhere inside of our system. So at a larger scale, you are going to have basically drop off and break points everywhere inside your funnel. You're going to have people who apply but don't book. You're going to have people who book but no show and 92 other places where you're going to have their phone number, their email, something that you can contact them with that a closer generally speaking is not going to do. Okay? So, you do have full stack closers and all that, but for us, we were dedicating our closers to just close. And the setters were non-existent, but the setters now have come in and reached into those pockets and basically have hot lead lists. They claim different leads and they dial them and get them back on the calendar, which overall will bring your if you're using paid, it'll just be more efficient. So, if you're using paid, it'll drive your cost per down. You do have to pay the setting team, but the math works out really, really well if you have a strong team. So, for us, this was a really uh efficient system for us to use. We never actually did direct to cart style stuff which you'll see a lot of people do. From there you move into your fulfillment system and of your fulfillment in my example info/coaching. That's my keyword and I'm I'm owning it. So info coaching for us in the beginning we sold initially a $27 a month app that was direct to cart. So I know I said we didn't do direct to cart but we really never got too much steam with that. We got up to around 100 grand a month, but very, you know, razor thin margins because we were playing an MR LTV to CAC range game that we did not understand. We had no ascension ladder and we didn't understand it. So, the first actual step into us making money and how we got into how we got to our first million- dollar month actually was selling info over the phone. So, we implemented this system where we ran paid mainly through Facebook, I think at that time only exclusively Facebook to a VSSL opt-in funnel. We only had closers initially. we were taking sales calls um then we hired team then we trained team then we managed team uh and then eventually we got closer managers and I'll go into that when I circle back through here um but for us we were selling an info product now the beauty of info product and it really is the offer that I'm kind of trying to pull through here because that is the most important part you hear stuff he has great videos on this on the different scales of what you hit and his books are structured in a way that the first one you learn is how to build an offer because it's the most important thing the next one is how you get lead flow the next likely is how you sell it and scale right there's there's different layers to this. But the offer that pulls through here for us that we were doing was an info product. So they got login access to a course, the very classic course access, group coaching and a Facebook group. Okay, different people use different platforms, platform agnostic. It does not matter. You can use circle, you can use you can use school, you can use whatever, but the delivery of it and how they actually get the results is done through information mainly in this example. Okay. So this is how we got to a million a month. We did 10 million and then 12 million I want to say or or or the other way around. I can pull the exacts but uh the two years prior and then we shifted our offer to be coaching. So the offer for the sales team was selling went from uh you know $1,1500 offer up to a $7,000 plus dollar offer that they were selling and actually it was a little bit lower but we have scaled up now to where it's $78,000 and that is more capital intensive because you now have a coaching team. So the fulfillment cost is higher but the offer is also like the the sales process is higher as well. So that took an entire different system up here. You needed more nurture. You needed because someone's sitting on their couch that just applies and then gets on the phone is much more it's easier for someone to buy something that's $1,000 than $7,000. So the funnels evolved. The depth of consumption involved. The closers need to have a higher skill set or just a higher belief level. And the issue for us was all these closers had only bought the $1,000 thing. So they didn't have as much belief in the $7,000 thing. So the total evolution of this as this transitioned and then selling the coaching and fulfilling on the coaching. So, we actually scaled up to where we had 70 coaches. We still have 70 coaches that fulfill on this at a onetoone level. Now, all of these have 19 other things under them. And again, I'm going to loop back around here and kind of go through these. But for the closing side, it was just those. And for the coaching side, it was 70 onetoone coaches. There are different types of fulfillment. There's group coaches. There are mastermind and onetoone level where it's actually just you doing the coaching. I like to think of the coaching ladder and like as a time and resource allocation. So the highest lever or not the highest lever opposite the highest that you can charge and the highest that likelihood of someone to get a result what someone's willing to pay for the most generally speaking is one-on-one with the guru the expert the person who is giving the info. The next layer is group coaching of that person. So instead of you having to work onetoone with someone for 50 grand or 100 grand instead you're working with multiple people in group setting. So you have a group call calendar and they all get on where you answer multiple questions. Also generally speaking you're in the in the community and answering stuff there. The next layer is onetoone with a coach and that's what the model we moved to. So you have now you have actual costs instead of your time. You now no longer have to do the coaching but you have to pay four coaches. So coaches then are a cost on the on the P&L that you have to understand and manage on your on your costs. Then the next layer from there is group coaching. So you have onetoone with you, group with you, then you have onetoone with a coach and then group with a coach. Okay? And the different ones have different costs both in terms of time and actual dollars. Okay? So that's how we moved to this one. That's how we got to our first $3 million month and then stayed around there. We actually we got to 3.7 was our peak month and then all of our acquisition broke because we broke this part of the system which again I'll loop back around to from there you have your tech system. This is where things start to kind of go out of order because the tech is underlying all of this as is this next pink one down here is an underlying factor that touches every single part of this but is critically important. So at almost all the way up until the last year or so, so call it 50 million or so in total cash collected. I had built all the tech on all the marketing side, the data side, the sales team, everything side. So the two core ones that I bucketed out are automations and reporting. So we are super automationheavy and at scale I think a lot of people should be. We're almost automationheavy to a fault and anytime that we had to build something, anytime that we were trying to scale into something, I found a way to automate it. Now, the issue with this is I almost found a way how to do it uh that was almost a duct tape style solution. So, we were creating automations that would do lookups in here and then find this and whatever just to get it live. And they are scalable, but when you stack too many of those on top of each other, it becomes like a really big mess. And we are actually trying to unwind this right now and build out new data systems and automation flows because we want to get to these next levels. And we know that it will work at scale, but it's just messy. which is too messy for what they call tech debt is going to carry with us when if we fix this now it'll be a cleaner scaling reporting absolutely huge. So reporting is going to be on your data. So automations are going to be things that someone has to automate that someone would manually have to do that you're going to come in and automate as simple as someone opts in you want to send them an email or a text as intense as you want to automate your sales team commission tracking. Uh you want to automate your cash flow management. You want to automate your everything you can possibly imagine, your deal flows, your your uh text reminders before things, your um hiring uh pipelines, anything you can imagine, you can automate. And now you can even do it more so with the tools like NAN that exist. Reporting is how you look at that data and when you look at that data, how that drives behavior and changes decisions. Okay, so this is huge and this is something we were extremely strong at. uh yes it was duct taped together but we were extremely strong at our reporting and always had access to our numbers even if we knew that they were within a 5% margin we would operate based on them because they were numbers that were important for us to scale into and to know that we could scale into okay so at this level and this scale again like I just said we are reworking the entire tech system where our data is stored source of truth all of that um but the reporting ability we've had on things like cash flow marketing stats sales stats fulfillment and uh both in fulfillment on terms of like financials and billing as well as like customer success, NPS scores, stuff like that. We've always had these. They've just been kind of messy, just pushed together and just like not the cleanest. So, this is something we're completely rebuilding right now, but has been extremely important for us to be able to scale. And people system again another one that just underlies all of this. Every single one of these at some level touches a person that is either running them in the actual role or managing them. Okay. So for us, hiring and management are the two core. So we have done a very good job of getting high quality talent. We have not always had such a we have not always been able to do that and that comes through a lot of things and again all of these have 19 things under them. I'm just going to point out two of them to keep this simple, easy, and help you identify maybe a place in your business that you're stuck at. Um, but for hiring, there's how you pay them, there is where you find them, there is where they at in their career journey, how much experience do they have. There are so many things on this, but we have now optimized to where we're a size through this stuff, for example, through creating YouTube content and getting out there a little bit more. We've found a lot of top talent in the online business, uh, info coaching space, marketing sp like in those niches. We found a ton of quality people. I have entire videos where I talk about this on how if you want to find a copywriter versus if you want to find an HR director, you have to look in different pools. If you're recurring hiring for something like a salesperson versus if you're hiring for an HR director, again, that's more of a one-off position. And then management. This is something we are actively working on. We are no way pros at any of this and I hope none of this comes off as ego look at us is the exact way to do it. This is just our experience of how we are bucketing our systems and our departments. And for management, we are getting to the level now where we essentially have a sea level. We're actually peeling back on people maybe that were at an operational level that really are kind of mid-level managers, but at our size, we're the highest level of managers. And now with the new levels and scale we're taking it, we are going to have, you know, multiple layers of management. In an example, we have, you know, chief of people under that. We have a CS manager that has CSC's, uh, customer success coordinators, billing, uh, billing support, like all these different pieces. We have in our coaching department, we have chief of product that then has um the basically mid-level like pod leaders of coaching and then the actual coaches in sales. We're going to have sal. So, we're getting to the point now where we have these multi-layers and management is becoming critical and the ability to manage projects, manage people and understand their entire department and their P&L is huge. So, if we zoom out a little, let's talk through some examples on where your bottleneck maybe is. So, I just talked to I've talked to a bunch of people in the last week or so and talked about kind of where their business is at and a kid I just talked to right before this was talking about how he wanted to grow his business. We talked and he said, you know, he's basically at 50k a month and I said, "All right, well, where's what's broken? Can you get more leads today or can you sell more people today? If you sold those people, would you break?" And he was at a point where he's doing a bunch of organic marketing that is both coming from referrals, which is kind of different. Um, and then organic marketing where he actually does organic marketing. So, he puts uh puts out content on YouTube, acts, all these places, gets a ton of uh impressions, gets a ton of likes, and then also gets people in his DM that are interested, me being one of them, right? So, I get to talk to him through that. I said, "Okay, so is it consistent for you is the first thing. What channels are you using? And then, how are you converting them?" Because for me, it was messy. I'm bouncing around all over. I can't get through on the calendarly thing. Like, the entire front end of this to get people to where they could even be sold was kind of broken. So, yes, he might have the lead flow, but his funnel and his way to get them to the next step in the in the situation is is not good. So, that was the first thing I was like, at least clean that up. You might not be bottlenecked there because you're still getting them through to sales, but it's something you can easily clean up. The next part was sales. I popped on with him. He was the founder. He's the owner. And again, he's doing good numbers. He's got great margins. He's doing 50k a month. Like, he's just slanging. But his sales system was a little choppy, right? And it was him on this. And then he was trying to share a dock and do this. And I told him I was like the next scale for you is if you want to because his goal was freedom and that was a big thing too we talked about was what is your goal and for him it was he wanted freedom he wanted freedom he wanted to make X dollars and kind of have like a fun company and I love it right he wanted to do business the right way is what he said so for a sales system I said eventually you are going to need this where you know you have all these people in your DMs so whether that's a closer setter hybrid or you have a setter over here that goes through your DMs for you so you're not over there setting your own calls and then instead of closing your own calls you have these so Right now, he may have, call it, 80% margins or something because he's running lean. Now, he's going to pay 10 or so percent here. This shouldn't cost much more because he's not going to do paid advertising, which generally speaking is anywhere from depending. Some people have crazy numbers, but it could be 10% and normally it's around 30% depending, right? Again, that's a 3x roz. So, you spend $100 to make 300ish. It depends on a lot of things. But, so through there, he would then replace himself from the sales process. And I said, "Okay, now if you sold a hundred people a week, what would break over here?" And he's like, "Everything, right? But if we sold five or 10, not that much. He knows the next hire and fulfillment for him. His is a service delivery, so something different than what we did for info and coaching. He would need another, you know, couple VAS that would do or editors more so that are kind of VAS. And then he would need uh like a basically like a middle-le manager that did reviews to make sure it was quality work before it went back out to the client. and he said we could do you know another 10 or 20 clients which is with just one more person which is amazing right because that means that his cost to fulfill only goes up a little bit in his team over here in order to scale to the next layer I said what is this system like and he's operating on Google docs and over here and over there and like this is something that you can kind of get away with depending for a while but it just makes things so much more efficient like he knows his numbers right now but does he know them at scale does he know the response times of things does he know um is he automating out Like they said they were automating some pieces, but as AI continues, are they automating thumbnail generation? Are they automating like all these other pieces of the puzzle that they could be unlikely right now, but this is something that you kind of always want to iterate on. You don't need to go full bore into, but you want to make sure it's efficient and lean. And then people, which again ties into all of these. So making sure that you have the best people that are aligned for your product for closers, that you have management over them. That's likely you at that scale that does that. Okay. Now, another person I talked to, this one's a little more interesting, but I talked to somebody that has massive amount of organic following, but has absolutely like no sales. Okay, so they are using a direct to cart system instead. Actually, let's use let's use another one that's more info and coaching. So, I talked to somebody the other day. Um, again, I have so much info. It's amazing. I love it when you guys message in and I get to just look at other businesses and numbers and models. Like, it's cool. I learn so much from it and then I get to think about things like this for our business. But I talked to one that I again hired again. So I heard about them through I was trying to hire someone as a developer kind of like an automation AI person for us that was also a developer and they said, "Oh, this is the company I came from." And I said, "Oh, I don't want to pay the company. I'd rather pay you direct." And he said, "No, you got to check them out." So I go to their website. I organically got there through a referral. I see that they have a little bit of stuff over here for organic. Their funnel was very simple. It was just an application. Book a call. I go to do so and the pages aren't loading properly. I email I get a thing that says click here for the thank you page. It's not. So again, more optimizations around this portion. I then go and book a call and I don't get the thank you page. I don't get any videos. I don't get any like pre-frame. So I email and ask them for uh a bunch of like case studies, anything you can send me. Send me everything before our call. I get nothing. I still am about to show up for this call. 10 minutes earlier before the call. They send me an email and it says, "Oh, check out the testimonial." It's like a oneliner. and I click on it and it had just been uploaded to YouTube prior and it's them on the call and they had just sent me a testimonial. They had just uploaded but I got on with them and because their product was so good that I ended I was like this is exactly what we need. This is exactly where we are at with our tech system and where we feel pain and they had the solution for it. So even because these other systems weren't good if they want to grow they need to optimize these but their fulfillment system is so good they just get referrals left and right. So it solves for this. They're just doing the closes because it's big ticket item. And now their fulfillment style drops through these grouping of calls basically to learn and get up to date on everything. And then they have a developing team on the back end. And they know their costs to a tea. They're very automated. They're very efficient which is their entire tech system. They are a tech company. So this is like completely forward. They know every number. They have every automation built and they have great people. Okay. So one of these is holding you back in your business. I 100% promise you it is holding you back. And this is kind of back to my whole bottleneck theory that I make videos on in other ones, but essentially it can be a cra a a traffic channel you need to crack. And to zoom out again, this is my opinion of things is how we're currently bucketing things based on how our leadership is and how we're trying to manage things across. With that being said, Horoszi, all these other guys have much larger businesses, have done this many more times over, not just in info coaching. I have a one at bat with this, which is essentially this company right here. Um, and scaling into this and learning as we go. This is showing what we're actively doing and showing what did not work which is a lot of the other videos and what is working for us right now. We're scaling pretty heavily right now and uh this is working and we fixed marketing system as our first big bottleneck because we weren't filling calendars for our team. Once we fixed marketing we realized that sales wasn't closing the right amount of them. So we solved for sales team with a new uh manager. So coming from the people portion we hired correctly and we now have a manager in place. So that has only changed a couple things and has had massive impact in terms of daily cash collected. Fulfillment system is getting a complete overhaul. We actually have other offers which comes back to fulfillment and sales and we are building that out to be the big issue there right now is kind of the tech and infrastructure because the the data they have the ability to fulfill the efficiency and the speed that they can do the coaching so they can have more clients per coach all of that kind of stuff is really coming down to like the data and the framing around how they do it. So, we're rebuilding this system next in and it's not even broken is the beauty of this. We're doing it proactively because we know this one's firing. We know this is firing and it's only a matter of time until these ones break. And to be honest, this one's kind of always breaking, right? So, you're always managing people. There's always something. There are personal problems. There are things that happen. That is life as you know for yourself and as you know for your teams. So, this one is an everchanging thing and it's really really helpful to have strong people over here. Whether that's you and your, you know, leadership or you have a strong leader in place like we do now at this point that manages this whole thing for us. But we're just trying to scale now to the level where we have strong CMO, strong CISO, a strong CPO. So this is actually product, a strong CTO, and then another strong people person. So CPO, right? That is the level we're trying to get to. And this next and I'm sure there'll be 15 more iterations of this. But again, one of these is broken in your business. And I hope this helped you solve it. Find your bottleneck. It's my thing I'm going with. But if you go through here, www.rankclog.comdoc. I think I believe today is day 71 or 72 in a row. I've made a video every single day. I've been mixing it up and doing stuff with really cool people I have met through doing this. So, I've been doing some cool interviews uh with different people who are crushing it in the space. Guys are doing 5 million a month. Guys who are are on their way to doing 5 million a month. Guys who have done over 60 million in MR offers uh that are scaling them up through organic. Like just crazy stuff. Um so yeah. So check those out. Hit me up on IG or X if you guys have any questions or if you want me to talk about something specific. And then tomorrow I do a oops I do a video where I go through all your guys' questions which you can find here. It's just a simple form just says pick a video topic or what you want me to break into and I'll walk through all of them tomorrow and which is May 24th. Okay? And if you're just coming to this on another day, you can still submit here. I do those weekly. So talk to you guys soon. I hope this was valuable.
