# Jace's $1.7M/mo Info/Coaching Growth Partner Strategy... | EP101
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJDM7zG9xqo

What's up, guys? We are back. Today is day 101, I think, which we crossed over the hundred. I said I was going to stop, but today we've got Jace on. Is that how you pronounce it? Yeah, Jace. Yep. Jace. Yeah, he's a G. I see him all over X. I see him on Instagram. He's doing big things in info coaching. You guys shredded me for not vetting people. I vetted this guy. So, uh, Jace, kick it off. Who are you? Let's go. What's up? Uh, my name is Jace. I, uh, ran a couple agencies in the past. We're all in the info space. kind of very niche space. Um took my first business was somewhat similar to like an an SMMA in the real estate space. Didn't really go well. I have a whole backstory on how that failed and whatnot. Um transition into more of a growth partner kind of agency where we're taking equity of certain businesses in the info product space now work with some private companies which I'll get into uh later. But that's where I found my success in the info product space. I think we really popped off like a year ago and um in April and uh around April and early May is when we found a lot of success when I had my biggest month. We made a client like $1.7 million. I had 35% of that business essentially. So you can just do the math and how much money we're making off of that. And um and we were number one on WAP during that time as well. So that's when my audience started taking off for like some of the new stuff and I've built a lot of things around that. So but yeah, that's basically who I am. That's amazing. So when how do you pick these? So like right now the current structure is and you called it what? Growth growth partner is like what? Yeah. Growth partner. Yeah. Yeah. So you'll come in, you'll identify someone who's like who's your like buy box or ICP that you'd have for someone you'd take on right now as a client in info. I'd say mostly mostly make money offers. You know there's there's always the niches of like health, wealth, and fitness. We've had some success. I know you you have success like the fitness offers. They have to have strict criteria in the fitness offers and like they have to run paid ads for especially for me and have a large ad budget. But money like in making more people money and if they do it um right if they actually show the proof that they make money doing what they do are are the bread and butter because that's the biggest pain point that someone can have. For example, the reason why it works so well for my client that we did that number for is because he do it was in the trading space. He documented him making $500,000 profit with trading on YouTube. it's very easy for someone to buy something and also it's very easy for me to sell people stuff as well because I show the process of us making $1.7 million with the client. So, anybody who has results and they're not just selling lifestyle in in info, I think um it's a good criteria for us to work with them. We even even had success with some smaller guys that literally just like for example I I had a client way earlier in the space that had like 4,000 followers but we made like 150k in the first like 5 days off of a super niche real estate investing offer cuz he really runs up numbers like that. So yeah, dude, the results are yeah huge. Um, I talked to Josh Gavin a bunch and their whole model is like it's not as niched down or like they don't specifically pick all these criteria and they do a lot of kind of like initial launches or beginners, but they crush with this. And it's like if you have a good expert that you can come in, we always say it's like and it's interesting that you say that, but it's like the the expert, the marketer, and the operator. And like you guys seem to do like both, right? Where it's kind of like marketer and operator to scale, but what I mean what does the team stack look like for you to fulfill on that for like the 1.7 for example? like who do you need to deploy or like what is the layout plan? Yeah, so I have a pretty good uh layout right now. Um I like to own everything so we can just move as fast as possible and we can get really fast feedback loops. So for example, I'm mostly handling all of the marketing. I now have copywriters underneath me. There was a time where I was writing all the copy, all the emails, everything that goes into running these info products and selling them. And then there was also a time in the beginning where I was also doing the sales and whatnot. And so I have sales uh managers under me as well that handle hiring the closers, hiring the setters. I was very strategic about it. Um my sales manager for some of my biggest offers also runs one of the biggest um setting and closing, you know, those opportunities where they come in, they buy into it, and then they get into it. Um closer cartel, he runs that essentially. And so he has an endless pool of just setters and closers that he can just bring on with that relationship. And that relationship actually really helps us because there's a lot of respect there. So I don't have to touch sales right now, but we're also able to take a larger percentage and I don't have to work with an outsource agency. So we can have really fast feedback loops. Any time that I've worked with, you know, outsource agencies or, you know, the client is paying us and they're paying somebody else. It's always way too slow. We can onboard a client in 4 hours. They can be onboard and we can start the marketing. Um, and that's because we're all communicating inside. And that also allows me to I I've always known for some reason that ownership is very very important. So when companies any client that we take on like let's say my sales manager also runs some of his own stuff but they're going to sign the contract with my company. They also are using our affiliate links. They're signing the contract under our company and that allows us to have a lot more control and faster feedback loops um with what we do. So that's the team step. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. So yeah, let's go like through like a demo. So you find someone that's a 250k. They usually already have they're they're already running. Right. Right. I mean, I guess maybe not because some like the 4K guy for or the 4,000 following guy. Like, that's a new offer creation. So, yeah, there's this girl that we were taking on. She has like a million followers now and we have to help her create the courses and whatnot and she just has to be competent. But like, yeah, I apologize. Oh, you're good. No, you're good. These are raw. These are full raw. Let me uh turn You're good. Um, okay. So, yeah. So, so from the front, so let's say like hers as an example. Okay. So, so she'll have a following. Yes. So she already has a piece of that organic, but let's go like marketing, sales, fulfillment, whatever. So like you take her piece on you. What do you do on marketing? So she has organic, but like do you guys run paid? Is that like a big part of your strategy? Is it all organic? Yeah. My idea of marketing is you should use any facet that you can that you can use for marketing. You should just frontload all of it. So we ask like do they have an email list already? Most of the time what people actually know me as cuz I know a lot of people run a similar business to me. Um, I'm actually a coach in in in a program where they're all operators. They're all trying to run this business up. Um, we run like a 15-day I don't know if you've heard this is what I find the most success on because usually you'll have the most success when somebody has momentum during the first 15 to 30 days when you're launching a program. That's usually very Instagram heavy that's email heavy. And I try to create a very big effect when it comes to the launch. I call it like the whisper tea shell funnel. So, usually you're whispering about a program. It's kind of like a pre-sale in the first like let's say you're doing a 15-day launch. In the first 5 days you're whispering about a program that's not even created yet genuinely. Um and a lot of times when clients sometimes they'll have courses and sometimes they'll have this that and the third. We try to just go the high ticket route like okay should they add more group calls and sell it as a $7,500 like cohort or should they you know just make like a 20k one to1 program and take 15 clients on which is kind of what we did for that for that big launch. and then we'll just transition it as a very new program. During that time, after like the 5 days of whisper, we'll start teasing it and we'll put them on a wait list. Now, the weight list is designed to grab a bunch of client uh what's it called? Like feedback so we actually know what people want and the weight list is going to ask them like what would you want to see out of this program? What would you want to see out of this trading program? What would you like use time? And then they go to like a telegram group or something like that where it's a very like it's kind of like a smaller like email list. we're able to like go and indoctrinate people and just kind of shout that that there's a lot of scarcity. There's a lot of scarcity and we have a lot of success when we're actually able to use real urgency and real scarcity instead of fake urgency and fake FTC. Yes, this is this is all real. But but yeah, and then what I like to do and what you really need to do is a lot of people don't understand market awareness and it it took me a long time to understand this. So like Eugene Schwarz, the five levels of market awareness. Um, a lot of times in the best case scenario, they're solution aware, so the VSSLs can be short during those times. Um, but we'll create a VSSL during that time and we'll just position it for the last day, which would be like the 15 days when we just send them straight to link. So during that time, we're also going to correlate emails, sending emails every single day. What I actually learned is the volume on own traffic and emails on those last like 3 days when you're launching the program, you should be sending like four to five emails a day just like completely selling people not only on like your program just saying that something is launching, but you have to be able to sell people even on even on cold. Like you should optimize all of your marketing for even selling people on cold right away. So you have to be selling people on the vehicle on you as the person that is selling the vehicle and then on your actual results. And if we can do all of that, it's a very big benefit. Like if they already have case studies and whatnot as well. Yeah. Um I'll try to do that. So I had a I actually I put in a lot more effort into the the last launch that we did, the $1.7 million one because I had I had a frame of reference. So my sales manager before us, he launched one of the biggest trading programs I think that has existed in like the in the info space in recent years and they did like $4 million in like 4 days of of launching their program. But what they had differently is they had longer time than us. So what this guy was doing for, you know, 3 months prior is he was going to the Las Vegas sphere and putting his name on the Las Vegas sphere with the helicopter going up. He was buying cars back and forth, buying jets. And I only had 30 days really to replicate that kind of effect to build up so much hype. So what I'll try to do during that time is I'll try to just build as much resonance as possible by just giving as much away for free. And so we put we'll put like three very long videos or just on YouTube or something that's just giving away all the courses and whatnot or just creating as much resonance as possible. So we're actually launching something. But yeah, that momentum during the launch phase if you really get that right is big. But even now just going more mature into business like you can't just because if you're not mature about it, bro, it will just go big on the launch then your revenue would just drop like crazy. Yeah. Well, that's what I was going to ask next is like, so how many of these have you gone from launch to evergreen model? So like that guy for example that like yeah, you did this big launch for 1.7. Does the dust settle and they're like 100k a month and like it's evergreen because organic it did like the next month we went to like 500. So it literally split in half, but it's always it it's always the so I I think we're doing really good because it's always the client facing problems. So, a lot of what I've learned in the past is they just kind of get settled after that. They stop bringing in volume. And the thing with info is a lot of people don't treat it like it's a real business where you consistently need to feed it. Like, if you're running an ecom store, the moment you turn off ads, you're going to stop getting sales. People don't treat info like that because they don't treat it like a real business, right? So, I mean, the best people are consistently driving more traffic to their topline. They're consistently posting more YouTube videos. And yeah, what you know we can have I I our sales system and marketing is completely dialed. So what we have to do is we just have to make it easier for them to bring in that traffic and that's usually why it dies. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Um I think the biggest thing like so we are we're we're all evergreen. We've never done a launch. We've never done like any of that stuff. And so many of these guys that I'm starting to learn, we were talking right before this, but like the the 5k people that are following this, you know, there's probably 10 to 15,000. I would say probably like total market, you look at like the Jeremy Haynes and like the following those guys like that's how big the market is. And a majority of that market is of people like us is doing organic like almost all of them. And like the info coaching space is so and I love it actually at some level. I talk to Iman and I talk to these guys and I'm like gosh the margins and the worldwide talent and I just the idea that it's really you know Eman's a different story because he runs it like a business but like a lot of these guys just run them as offers like what offer are you on oh what offer are you running now like even and like and no shame on that but like even you know you say something you're like oh yeah we ran this offer and it did 1.7 cuz it's an offer it is it's a launch it's like it dies down it has its thing and then a new offer comes out of it versus like it's a business that's this evergreen thing that like consistently makes x amount of cash. So that's the beauty though at some level of the paid strategy. So ours is 99% paid. Now that bites into margin and that's you know 30% of the P&L is just off the rip gone because you spend a million bucks to make three million or whatever the math. Um but I don't know. I I like the evergreen. I like building the business around it. It's kind of a pipe dream to ever say that one of these is going to sell. There's only a couple guys, but it's not a pipe dream to say that you can go to nine figures in revenue uh with some of these. Like you've got the think of the whales, right? You've got your Tony Robbins. Like think all the way up there. These guys are massive and their info coaching, their mentorship, their events, their like all that stuff. So, it's cool. So, like what So, let's use the 1.7. So, like what was the structure of that offer or like offer stack that made it so you guys did 1.7 on a launch? Yeah. So, he was running a course for like the last eight years and nothing was structured there. He just had a very big audience. Um, I can say his name. It was it was Q Banks. If you guys know um the trader Q Banks, um he's had a very just malicious following, very cultlike following, but he was only making like 30K a month because he would just sell his course at like $12.99. And so what we did is we did the launch, yeah, like 1,200 bucks and he would get 20 30 units a month. Yeah. And like a little Facebook group and whatnot. And so the thing that we turned it into usually is we'll just turn it into more of a cohort model where there's two live trading sessions a week. There's one live Sunday markup where it's actually showing his trades and then there's a there's a coach in there that's giving people live support every single day that's a that's a successful student and that was basically the model that we added onto it. So, we just added group calls and then we did add a very high ticket uh one to one model where it was one um we filled up 15 spots in in one day off of that and it was 20k and it was crazy. And this whole time he's been selling something for 1,200 bucks and like he's got a you know an audience frothing like eight years is cool too because they have the consumption and you have the audience like even if it's only 20 people or 50 or 100 like so much res. Yeah. Yeah. I should have just closed all the deals and made Yeah. Literally, I mean, dude, you could have Yeah. You could have sent a DM and gotten, you know, people pay through links instead of talking to a sales team. Yeah. Yeah. And then and then we we had an issue obviously after the one to one spots were filled after a day that most people wanted the one to one. But that's that's the benefit of me having someone as a sales manager who has so much results that we just have to show people that they don't actually need onetoone coaching to become a successful trader and whatnot. Um, and so that that was the model. And when we were doing the launch, it was all just about that this system, WSA system, you have to have a system in place. You have to have a USP. That's what a lot of people are missing nowadays as well, especially in trading. Um, is the only system in place and this is the number one program and it will be closing soon. Um, I've never launched something like this. It's been 8 years since I've been doing this. That's a lot of money. Yeah. And it's cool that you can Yeah. With something like that, you're like, I do have eight years of experience in this. You're not just like some fly by night, come out of nowhere guy. Never launch again ever. Yeah, exactly. You made 1.7. You're done. So the offer was what was the front end of it? I don't know if you said that part. So like what was the what was the majority of that cash? So obviously you had your one to one, but then was the other is it an MR play? Is it like a you said cohort based, but is that like So yeah, we'll we'll usually have we'll usually have three different options that we'll do. I I really never sell low ticket just on just off of BIP just on the front end, but we'll always have it as a downell and that will usually just sell the course access like 1,200. But the we sold group coaching for 7500. So no one to ones, no customized. Um they'll you for the one to ones we'll usually have like a channel set up with Q for direct communication. If they want to schedule a call, they'll be able to do that with the assistant. Um and so we had to transition really really fast and basically you just have to have the sales people frame it as now you don't actually need onetoone coaching. You just need this to actually become successful and at $7,500. and you know when one to one spots open up again when that you know 3-month program ends then they'll be able to fill up again. So that was basically that but you have to have you have to have like three different offers kind of and that the low ticket should be ours was like 1,200. It's no MR right now. I think we're thinking about launching that a little bit here in the future to frontload some of you know add some cash into it um because we can ascend those people but yeah that was it. I just hung out with uh Ahmed in uh London and I've talked to him on here before but he kind of opened my mind to the whole like obviously I see the trading guys or whatever but I don't really understand the business. I didn't understand fully the business model but it's super cool how in the trading world it's almost like flipped to how other info is like the done for you instead of it being like all the way on the back like you have with some bisop thing with trading it's like the front. So you're paying $97 a month for done for you because you're getting signals and like just being in the chat and they do so much volume with that. Like it's insane. So his whole model is it's all organic. He finds like I think he says on the video, but he finds like the black swans, the guys who are like legit, not just like the fly by night traders. They do a ton of MR and then on the back end is the done like do it yourself and the done with you. It's like the education portal is the 5ks, the 20ks, the whatever all the way up to one coaching which is you know 20k, 50k, whatever. But they have this huge bedrock that's constantly filling from organic that is this MR play. And I'm like that's super interesting because that's like complete opposite of how we do it. Ours has to be like flipped. It's like an info thing that solves this little problem and then over here is like you know done for you which you can't even do done for you fitness, right? You can't do that. That the highest tier is done with you or onetoone coaching. It's like the highest tier and then it's either a group it's it's a coach or it's the expert and that's like you know the differences. But we don't even sell our expert or like Yeah, it just not work out for you. Yeah, exactly. We can't work out for you. But yeah, I don't know. There there's cool stuff in our in our model where and and I think you said it in yours, but like you know, affiliate links and all that. There's a lot of monetization methods that especially, you know, traders for example, are you guys where do you host them? Do you put them on like a specific platform like uh like [ __ ] or school or whatever? All of our guys are on Discord because that's where I run my business communications as well. I don't use Slack anymore. We all use it. It's very uh very simple and um no MR is our next play. It it really is. I it the only thing is that we really need to get solidified and this is with a few of my offers right now is just the USP because you actually you have to start there's a point in info where if you cuz I think in big numbers I want to get back to a million dollars a month consistently. Uh we really can with the amount of momentum he has, the amount of traffic that he just commands every time he posts something. um you have to sell based on the offer, not just based on your Q banks or mil, whoever you are, you know, because it's just not sustainable at that point, you know what I mean? Um and I momentum is so so so important and I think uh a skill that I've had to learn in the last two or three weeks when we were uh two months ago we launched that offer. What I've had to learn during this point is how to create manufacturer momentum and that's it. It's just like having having that system in place and it's not effective just to keep doing relaunches, keep doing relaunches. I'm actually in the transition to um work with one of Ahmed's old clients and he was kind of telling me that was some of of the issue as well. He's not selling based on the offer or the system. Uh William Brown, I think you had him on. He's he's he sold a big trading company al specifically off of paid ads and his whole system was being a mechanical trader and a lot of people try to copy that but it was all because he had a USP in place. You know what I mean? Yeah. But that's one thing. No, yeah, I think the like the school kind of like uses it as their bedrock of like how how the flow works, but it's like get people in a free group or a low ticket group and then there's the ascension and then there's that. And I think that works so well with organic specifically because it's like at any time of day at any whatever they get to the point on their own, not they have to go through your perfect funnel flow and like talk to someone on the phone or your perfect acquisition model where they bounce. It's like when they're ready after consuming x amount of content, they're already going to go there. And if it's free cuz it's the easiest thing or like this great offer that's free or whatever or this low ticket thing like they can when they're indoctrinated enough they enter that and then the true indoc and like you know you and I know then the real indoctrination starts they sit in this free they sit in the free or paid group they get this consumption at the same time you're making two 5 200k MR and then you're doing the activation events inside there to get them into your launches essentially. So there is still the there's a weight list that exists but it's like gated through this other monetization method that I think is like huge and you know we don't do that for example like we we we'll sell 1% of our leads because it's the discrepancy in cost right it's a 5 10 whatever K thing and we're running all this paid traffic so we just get name email maybe they apply like the percentages break down but like in the end it's like what would these 99 other people where would they live would they live in a free Facebook group would they live in a low ticket Facebook group but is it one time or is recurring like we're trying to figure out kind of that piece of it because we run so much paid that the consumption is just different than organic. It's just much much different. So like how do we have it so it exists within the organic which for us is middle and bottom of funnel and then how do we have the offer stack that both makes money and indoctrinates for what really matters which is like our core program or in your example like your weight list to core program. So we're all playing the same game. It's just like a different you know different way to look at it. Well, the issue with us isn't relaunching because we'd have there's a lot of people that do this in the trading space. For example, every time TJR launches, it's just a it's just another number. It's 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. But he can do that because what what is lacking and I don't want to be like the trading guy, but I just have so many offers that have been That's good though. I mean, if you know Yeah. If you got your pocket, you got your pocket. Yeah. I know you've had a couple of couple of them on, but that's just how the affiliate it kind of worked for me. I just kept Well, I just heard that they're just such like a clean business model. Like I said, the offer stack flip and like that's why it's kind of that's interesting to me that you guys haven't really hit the MR thing. Um because that is a big bedrock of what a lot of these guys have talked about is like they use that. We launched it like a month and a half. It's more of just like us communicating how the client actually wants to do it. Um always just communication, bro. Always. Yeah. That's everything in life. Yeah. Yeah. But what what most traders are lacking right now um and honestly just everyone selling coaching is just lack of transparency. So like if you look at people like TJR has no issue launching his boot camp showing and people are going to get results of that and he has no issue every two days or every one day showing him making money with trading showing him with his live trades. And if you look at every even if they're smaller bro like I think um yeah one of one of our one of our other clients that we just do like consulting for all he does is just volume consistently posting him making money on trading every single day. And a lot of my clients I had to like reframe their mind. and they're like, "Okay, but if they get the results from my free cons, they're not going to want to go to the paid." And I'm like, "No, look at how this is doing everything because they don't want it's not they want the implementation. They actually want the time with you essentially." And for example, I have this ve I have this uh smaller niche uh crypto trading guy and he was very big five, six years ago, but like I said, momentum kind of dies down. You have to pick it back up. It's one of the things with info. Um and somebody bought a bought a 20k one to one spot for him and he wins. He used the program and he made literally $2.1 million off of crypto and he paid us 100K for an inerson a Bali uh crypto thing, whatever they're doing, right? Yeah, there's a lot. Yeah, that so that's interesting. So, like where do you want to live in this? Like this is your pick your own pick your own dream. Like you want the traders you like like who I mean you said make money online. like who I mean not to say names but like what kind of offer stacks does I mean you keep saying USP like I'm completely in agreement with that but like when you're doing make money online do you find that you need to find someone that's you know to use OMAD's language like a black swan someone who's like legit as like all can be we talked about this before I get in you know trouble for not vetting people like I don't know how does that work if you're building an offer around them or like they're your partner in things I don't have it's pretty easy yeah it's pretty easy to see who's getting results and and who's not and who actually has a lot of traffic and who doesn't. This is why we like to do the launch first launch fast because like if we maybe we'll make 100k in the first 15 days and we'll see what what's good and what's not. Um the best clients are are never not posting posting volume like posting volume is so so important. Um I've had a lot of reframes and a lot of things that I need to work on with within the business as far as our offer operations are solid. I've spent so much time. Um, I actually have a I have a licensing program that I that I've sold like 15 of. I have a very micro audience as well and I sell it for 15K. It's literally all of our SLPs because I have Loom videos, hours and hours of Loom videos showing the exact processes of everything that we do. So, anybody can literally set up the same business and use the same systems that we've used to hit $1.7 million. My goal with the business is to have 10 clients doing a million dollars a month and have larger rev shares. So, it took me about like seven clients to hit 200k per month profit for me. Um, and that was the month that we did. I met a guy yesterday who and I was talking to him for a bit. He has one client and he has profit share with him. He has he retains like 25 30% most months and he makes 150k a month from one client. Um, one client that was that was my game. Yeah. Yeah. I mean like I and I tried to do the whole like mine came mine's like a little kind of like funky weird way around that cuz I didn't understand how this industry worked or like we fumbled into this and we did it for x amount of time but mine was that mine was a profit share which then turned into equity like real quick but like same thing and you know depending on how you look at it it's definitely not the same thing but like same thing if you look at just cash flow on it and that was mine and it was how do we scale this thing up and do it and like I had my piece of the puzzle and everyone had theirs and we scaled into it and then once it got to a point that was a little more hands-off because ours was evergreen not launches, not continuation of new things. It was like, oh, I'm going to go do it over here in like life insurance or, oh, I'm going to go do it over here and like just where my life was at and like where I was at with focus and like ability to do things. I was just dropping the ball after I was like, this is not that interesting to me or like why not just push the main thing forward and that's when the big conversations happened to like let's take this massive, let's change up the cap table so that's reflected so that percentage is different. um let's do, you know, some of these things. And that all came into place. And now I'm like like dialed. Like I I talked to Josh Gavin about this. I'm like, "Dude, why do you have 40 of these?" I'm like, "Why don't you take one or two or five of them and push them to a million to three million a month with these?" Like, "Dude, you can get to 150, 400, 700k a month, like with those models and a couple clients, bro." Always like always, always. And it's just like less headache like you know you know you're in Discord and you got nine different channel or 50 different channels the different offers you run and like it's a g you know I bad wording but like it's a glorified agency model you just have a really good monetization model you have a percentage of the upside. You have a really good performance model to do xyz work that someone else is charging 5 or 10k for and makes 100k on. You have the opportunity because of how you have it leveraged in your authority and your skill and your whatever to make 500k 700k on that same workload that someone else is doing it for 10k or 20k or whatever. And it's like it's a superpower. Also, also one of the mistakes, I don't even know if this is a mistake, but I always after we got around like three to four offers, I always outsource sales to the sales manager. And I made sure to get it give him a good percentage to make sure he was obviously making money as well. And there was times where I even split the percentages with him. And so she got a little small. If if I had that 12.5 like if I had that 15 plus on Q's offer I mean I would have made you know what I mean I would have made like 400 bands in that month. Yeah. Yeah. So that's so so your model is uh revshare or profit share. Revshare. Yep. Okay. That's [ __ ] amazing. Yeah. So revshare and then your team stack is your couple like core people whatever and then you break off then you pay the sales team from that batch. Yes. So we'll have like 35% 15 automatically goes to sales. Sometimes like you don't need setters for certain certain deals. So you won't retain like the five. Closer to 10. Yeah. Always 10. And um and yeah. And then we we have the we have the the rest of the split. So yeah. Yeah. That's amazing for that offer. Honestly, I should have just put more boots on the ground, just handled sales if I wanted to maximize revenue um that month. And that's what the guy I was talking about doing 150k off of one client. He's complete operations, you know, he handles all that. It allows me to work on more CEO things. It It has seriously allowed me to build all of our backend systems and um really systematize the agency, but if I want to just have a lot of cash flow, I I'll have to dive deeper into the process and take more. Yeah. I was talking to Luke yesterday, the co-founder, business partner, and uh I have so many people that reach out to me that are like, "Oh, can you help me with this?" or like, "Can you do this?" And I just like I, you know, no consulting calls, no free, no none of this. I'm good. But like I will make the occasional referral and it's very very common for people to reach out about sales and my frame on it is kind of shifting to the level of like I almost think info coaching businesses shouldn't do their own sales like 99% of the time is like where my frame is starting to go because it is it becomes such a people issue and like a lot of the time for these companies they're so lean everywhere else but the sales team can only be so lean like as you start to do big numbers you for the volume you need a high amount like there's so many emotions and ups and downs. pounds and like missed opportunity potential and like that's going to happen anywhere I guess with the sales team but to like get the mind off of it completely and not have to like have a daily huddle and all this and then have a sales manager and then you're working with the sales manager and then breaking off points. So what I've started to do uh is I I I found one guy that I really like and I know I'm sure there's a few right like you know some guys or like closer cartel like um like you know Luke like those guys are badasses but they live in like kind of more internet marketing world like ours doesn't. So, I know a guy that I refer out now that does I think it's common practice, but 20% of all net new cash. So, they'll just like only handle that 20% and like it's done. And that's management, that's setters, that's closers, that's everything, which again is kind of high, you know, compared to year 15. But for offers that are evergreen, not just like a launch model, deploy and then like pull them back. Uh, I found that I I mean I would have done that if I I still would do that if we weren't running this to like we need everyone W2 and in house and we're playing this like pipe dream game of like let's exit and get this thing to hundreds of millions and like do that but like I don't see why anyone would do it in-house at at SC like I don't see why they would if they're so good at like being the expert or so good at like having to just operations some marketing some expert and that it's like sales just becomes such a pain. So, anybody who DMs me about it and like again people are going to hear this and whatever. Like I just refer out and I like my guy that I refer out to. He's a sicko. He's like a systems guy. Like we chopped it up at dinner when we were in Dallas and I'm like yeah this is like my kind of people like he thinks about things in a very like strategic way. Um but interesting dude. Revshar is like that's like a goated model. Like that's probably the best model you could have. Well yeah and then when you refer out uh sales teams as well they're forced to perform. So you know because they they don't want to get replaced. Sales managers are replaced all the time. So, yeah. All the time. All the time. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So, like what's your what's your play with this? You're you you look young. You're chilling. What? Miami vibes. Is that Is that what that look is? Miami. Yeah. You can't see it, but like 82nd floor up there. Just moved into this like a month and a half ago. I did this because um so just long-term play, short aspects, uh private equity. I want to get into I I want to I want 10 clients doing a million dollars a month at this. Um I'm not really thinking about my my own offer. private licensing program. If people want to get it, it's pretty sick. It's literally like Google Docs and Loom videos and if you want to send voice notes back and forth, you got it. But the reason why that sells so [ __ ] well is because I literally This is what this is why this made me rethink about info a lot. People would people literally paid me I had like three people pay me in the DMs when we had that big launch. Um when I posted that you that Instagram reel about us being number one on [ __ ] I don't know if you saw that on my Instagram account. I think it's at like 30k views. Uh Tai Lopez followed me from that. People reach out to me from that. I post that on Twitter. It went kind of crazy because because you know when you're talking about big numbers, the big dogs start following, bro. You know what I mean? And um I Yeah, three people pay me in the DMs, just 15K up front just for the licensing systems and it because it makes so much sense if I literally already got the result that you got and I documented everything and I'm giving you the actual process that I did to use it. It's a very simple process. And that's the problem we have with a lot of these offers is that yeah, you can make sales. People believe in the offer as much as possible, but if you're actually cuz a lot of traders like out there don't actually make money with trading. It's pretty well known, you know what I mean? Um, so not my speed, dude. So not my speed. Even like that was the whole thing about the video yesterday. It's like, oh no, he just makes money, teaches people how to make money. I'm like, bro, that at some level is the industry. I don't know what you want me to do to vet that. Like, yeah, we try and stay over in this game. we play in fitness or we I talk to like you know the big guys that have really really good results and do 10 million launches and this and that. I'm like I don't Yeah. I don't know. It's it's it's a messy industry. Yeah. And then and then the thing with me is once you learn marketing and sales systems and you can implement them, you can work with many many different businesses. So um I now work with uh Q's prop firm essentially. It's like a nine figure prop firm and we do we do sales for them essentially. We have and a lot of times it's sending out text blasts every single week and we'll spend like $1,300 on a text blast and literally make like 30k from that and have two dialers in place. A similar system that we ran with info. We set it up super cleanly and one of the they're they're all around advertising in Miami around here and so is a lot of my clients. That's the reason why I moved down here and eventually that's a long-term equity play as well. So you can you can ascend way past info and what you can take a lot of opportunities past these things. how I like literally took an info business a year ago, met up with some coffee, made up 100K, and then that's transitioned into working with one of the top prop firms in the in the space. I know a lot of guys that you've talked to that work with traders will work with like those automated algorithm systems as well um that other people have. There's a lot of money that you can make outside of info. So, yeah. Yeah, a lot of monetization models. And then yeah, so your plan so you see I I'm having kind of some bigger conversations about this and we talked about this right before but like how I want to play in this game or not like our big thing is like we're going to grow this a golden goose. We're going to grow this big business. It's going to be right there. Proof is in the pudding. It's like it is that and it's so interesting to like or so exciting potentially and interesting to do like ecom or go do this lead genen thing and like I know all these guys and I'm like these all sound so fun and they all have like potential for true like equity value. Like they there's again there's proof that these businesses sell. Info coaching sits in this land of like no man's land where they don't unless they hit exit velocity. They get into they have all these other monetization plays. They have all this recurring. They have all this you know there's no more personality brand directly behind it. Like all that stuff needs to happen and then you kind of are like almost no longer info coaching when you get to that. So it's like you start there and then you get there. So what do you I mean you you said equity a couple times said private but like that's for like businesses that's for you think info coaching that then does hit exit velocity like what's your thought on that? Yeah, a lot of my a lot of my clients own businesses that outside of info as well that is kind of like okay moving into like for example Toptier has been running as a successful prop firm for a long time and now we own um you know like sweat equity and that business that of what we bring in like we revenue share with them as well and um that turns into bigger relationships. I would love like the way that I look at it is every business that you're going into you should market so you're trying to position to exit because that means there's consistency consistency price. Yeah. You make it a machine whether you're going to sell or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you you own the traffic coming in. You own the client base coming in. um you have a consistent but it's like it hasn't really been you know we've had we'll still make hundreds of thousands of dollars per month with a lot of our offers but it's never to a place where it's just it wouldn't look pretty for someone buying the business you know or like an in you know what I mean so it's still the base that that that we're learning you know yeah I heard uh I think it was a Hormosi somebody quote but they were like yeah every every business is still a [ __ ] show inside like you know the hundreds of million dollar businesses you pop in something you get on board and you're like someone's still on a Google sheet somewhere and you're like, "Wait a minute, what?" Like, it's it's always it's always going to be archaic. And well, for us, yeah, for us, for the systems in place to run the business, it would absolutely, you know, be appealing to an investor. It's all just top ofline traffic and top of line like, bro, traffic coming in and it consistently having interest there. It's so many. You ask how many times has there been like momentum off of the launch and it dropped down? Almost every time. And then it was just like us us picking it back up like we're doing with Q, like we're doing with Sam. And there's transitions that happen in place that you have to just move very fast on, have very fast feedback loops. For example, most people that who are printing with info right now are just giving out as much volume as possible on long form content and that's all it is. You know, we can send out daily emails every single day and try to do this, that, and the third. It's not going to work. Um, we just had one client, the crypto client post a video yesterday and hit two days ago and hit 23k views and we made 40k cash off of bit. It's it's crazy. And the people giving the most amount of volume possible. I have this one client right now. Everyone thinks he just makes millions of dollars. He doesn't, you know, he really doesn't. And because he had a severe drop because he thinks that he can just continue posting the lifestyle content on Instagram and continue selling that way. There's a few guys running this space right now that have a marginal audience, a marginal kind of traffic base that are just posting three-hour long videos, going over their processes, going over proof. You got to use big numbers and they're making $500,000 a month. John Mark Stevenson is [ __ ] killing it, right? If you know him. Yeah, that's that's his model. He's not even running direct response ads. Go over his his funnel with ads. Kind of like a Hannes approach. Yeah. His USP is dialed. That's this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about USPs. Yeah. I know it's it's there's a lot of ways to cut it. I think that I think if you and what you're already I mean you're already talking about doing it, but it's just like nailing the evergreen after you get like the big launch momentum and then being able to handle or having something that you know either exists already as evergreen or turning the launch then into evergreen is like such a such a big play to make it so you have consistency. Like that was a big issue that even within evergreen we've had the issue of not having consistency because it's paid, right? So like if you mess up on paid and for the longest time like I'm always like oh yeah this like the whole thing of this was one funnel and that's about as bad as having one challenge or one launch like just no redundancy no just like you know diversification. So now that we have you know I haven't made an update video but we have I think six or seven frontends now running like different acquisition methods. So we have you know one that's low ticket we have some direct two but we have different VSSL opt-in funnels with different messaging pockets with whatever and they all feed the main beast. So it allows the evergreen to be more consistent. But when we weren't in that position last year, we like, you know, tripled and went to 30 million and acquisition exploded. Like CPA is just going like this on paid. And we're like, we need to keep the calendars full. Everyone's W2 now. Like we just like made our bed and we're like, we got to just bite it. We got to bite it. And a lot of people probably wouldn't, but we're like, you know, longterm, longterm, longterm. Kick the can, burn the cash. But it's just a different game. It's a different game than what a lot of these guys play. So, okay. Okay. So, that's a cool plan. I got I do have questions here from what they asked, but I want to quick touch on your Miami thing. So, like you're How old are you? Young. I'm 20. You're 20. Yeah. Yeah. You're a G. I thought so. Okay. I was going to say like 19. So, um yeah, dude. That That's legendary. So, small team printing cash and then what? Moved to Miami and then got your 82 82nd floor and now you're just posted and there's so many people there I feel like that are in like your realm or like your zone of online. Very local. Yeah. Yeah. So why you guys like I dude that's one thing I made a video on this the other day but like I like lived in straight up isolation for like 10 years. I had like no online friends that did the same thing. I have like my hometown like 15 year friends. I'm 28. Um and you know I just kind of [ __ ] off once we started in like all honesty once we started making some like solid money more or less like we were just kind of like yeah we'll just keep this a cash flow biz. I'll dance around on this and just have fun. and like major regrets around that like could have hammered it when it was hot but friend-wise never was locationally somewhere and never really like sought it out like kind of more introvert. So like what's the Miami scene like? Like you guys like what you have a bunch of friends that are either in info coaching or traders or whatever and you just post up and friend dinners and all that like what's the vibe? Yeah. Um I think momentum is just very I I think like a city that's just very alive. Like I love New York for that reason. Nobody's ever sleeping. For example, I did this somewhat of the same thing. So, um, for the past 6 months, let's say like 6 months before March, I would I'm from Minnesota if you don't know. Nobody knows like where I'm from, right? And I I basically Heaven's in Minnesota. Really? Really, really? He still lives there though. He's got like this like, you know, he's in a beautiful apartment. He's got a wife now. Like he's like a good old boy. Like he's But yeah, he still lives there. I'm like, dude. But for for a year, I was in a cabin in Minnesota, nowhere. I wasn't going to like the gym. I was doing like at home workouts and whatnot in a cabin in straight up isolation that whole time just figuring stuff out and that absolutely built me. And then um I went to New York one time for the for the W headquarters. I've been um to New York a couple of times and I feel like I feel like the best thing you can do is when you're when you're really young, go to a city that's just straight up alive where everyone is doing what you're doing and and there's bigger dogs than you. For example, I went to uh Dubai for two weeks. I before this, before I went to Miami, I went to Dubai and I had I was like, "Do I want to go back to the US or should I not?" I just flew to Marba, Spain for 2 months. I I just kind of did it. And the amount of [ __ ] wealth in Marba, Spain, the people like pulling like just straight up French billionaires, right? Uh really motivated me. But it wasn't it wasn't the momentum that you know where a lot of people were coming up to you, a lot of people knew you, a lot of people were trying to compete. Every time I get recognized a lot because it's just very uh local local presence. I posted a video of me sending a 150k wire. I'm at 20 in Miami and people are asking me about that. And um but you can tell when everybody's asking you questions, they're trying to compete with you. They're trying to do this that and the third and competition really like I have a very very competitive like almost if you know Andy Purcella and you know his kind of mindset with that like stepping on their necks and keep keep going after that. Um that's the type of ruthless competitiveness I have. And then all of my clients are here and all of the businesses are here. So very locationally dominant. I I had a lot of in-person clos meetings here and um it is kind of a power play but later on we'll buy some property somewhere else and uh you'll have those different location. I feel like you got to have you have a place in my place in like maybe Lawrence [ __ ] Italy or Tuskanyany or something and then somewhere else you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm trying to decide what the next move is. cuz I did the Puerto Rico thing for tax game and whatever for the last 3 years and was like major isolation and like there's cool there's a lot of pocket of people but again like I was just kind of like locked inside wasn't my vibe also just like just you know candidly like a rough zone of life like I was just like doing my thing and uh I just popped out of there came back to hometown range you know 30 minutes from where I'm from girlfriend friends family thing we're like all here so I was like oh whatever easiest move not to say not to say I regret it uh but let me just say like it's a different vibe I've lived always like since I've been you know out of the house basically in places like that right not necessarily you know 82nd floor but like the beautiful place in Chicago this the corner glass suite over the river the you know even in PR like even a stepping stone place was like beautiful little glass box all the lights all the stuff like that's my jam and now I'm in like not that let's just say it's like beautiful it's very nice but it's like it's cold it's all this I'm like what am I doing like I don't have to do this at all but yeah location's huge I left I yeah I left a big part out of that I've always been the I've always been the guy who works 20 like works 48 hours a day that is known just like a super everyone asked me if I'm on aderall. I don't take Adderall, you know what I mean? Um but one thing also when we when I made all that money like I literally received the wire when I was in the Spain airport. I I I had to like question what meaning was a little bit again because I and I got a little burnt out after that and it it's it's uh it was never hard for me to get out of bed and continue working. A lot of people talk about this. Um, but I had I was in isolation for so long because and you know I don't I don't take a lot of calls now. There was a time where I was taking a lot of calls with the team and then obviously it's just all business conversation. Didn't pursue any girls during that time. Um, and I think moving somewhere to Miami, bro, I literally lost 10 lbs in like two weeks here. And uh, I post like my results there and it just really worked on my charisma. And you have to get your charisma and your personality back because I'm a firm believer in, you know, the the if you look at people like Alex Becker and you look at some of his crazy content or like Elon, they all have their childlike curiosity still intact. And I would never want to just become like a a a gray personality and I was becoming that for a while just consistently like doing the slave work, doing the office work, head down at my desk. And you need to you need to reignite that. That's one of the main reasons I'm here as well. Like getting sun every single morning, you know, being Yeah. So yeah, when I was in PR, it was like, you know, multiple time like, you know, go on the one to five mile walks. It was the pools across the street every time after the gym. Like gym has always been a non-negotiable for me. Like every day, like that's just like a like I don't even have to put that on like a goals list or whatever. It's like no, I'm doing that. Um, you know, maybe some like hit more hit it harder, but 30 minutes to an hour a day every day. But the change up to being here to not having the sun, having like the activity of the walking, and then you know, the thing that has here that I didn't have there is like people. So I can do the dinners and stuff, but again it's not with people like love them. Everyone's great as people, but like the business conversation doesn't exist. So once I start doing this, I'm like, "Oh, I think I found like a little bit of a pocket here where I can at least do it digitally and next step is where do I move that's locationally like in alignment too?" Cuz like Miami is not my speed. Miami is not my speed. Like that's too I don't know. It's too it's there's too much like kind of party scene, too much kind of like uh yeah, just XYZ that I'm more of like a Scottsdale or like even I live in Scotsdale before this. I lived in Scots for a year. It's lit. Yeah, I'm a big fan. I I went to I went to Arizona State for like a you know semester. But uh my family's out there. Half's out there, half's here. So kind of fun. But let me get into some of these questions they have on here before we just talk about our personal lives and to to to nauseium. Um so the classic questions, but dude, you're you're young. This is hilarious. What would you do? What would you do different differently if you had to restart with no cash and no name? So, you know everything you know, but you have no cash and no audience or awareness. Yeah. I I would just take massive risks and really fake it till you make it. That's that's what I did. So, really that's awesome. Yeah. I mean, my first client So, what I cuz dude, I come from no money. Like, absolutely none. I I drove a 1997 Honda when I was 18 years old and like in college. Um, but I did a lot of things. So, my first business was like a was like a magazine. I spent all of my money down to the tea on a $5,000 camera to start a magazine cuz that's what I wanted to do. And I took all my money, flew out to LA, uh, Santa Monica. You kind of just sometimes see celebrities walking around and whatnot. And I took that tried to promote the magazine. It absolutely failed. The second business, AAR, I would make crazy claims. And basically what happened with that business, and I'll get into the main the main thing that I'm kind of talking about, but is I would make crazy claims. We would sell it. I'd have a guarantee in place just straight off of like, yo, we're going to do this. I'm going to make this happen. I got that business literally up to like 20k a month, but we had to refund everybody and I was I was down and out. I was in debt at like 18 years old because I had a guarantee to hit and we never hit it. The main when my when my life changed, I I think this is some sort of uh you know faith-based thing in universe thing. It's just like if you just keep pushing and you keep having that faith that something is going to happen. What what happened was um I got the attention because I started really uh diving deep into into info coaching. Um I I just saw the opportunity and I saw everyone going into it about 2023 and momentum was hot in this space and I reached out to this guy. He was in Arizona. I had a few backto-back conversations with him. I showed him the opportunity value. If you show pe if you don't have results, a lot of people ask me this. All you have to do is just show them the opportunity value. So, for example, if somebody has 100,000 followers or they have a business that they can run, you just show them other competitors and you try to find, you know, some sort of referrals that um, for example, let's say they have a friend doing 100K a month. No, yo, you could be doing 150k a month. Showed them opportunity value. He asked me to go and get coffee the next day. I was in Minnesota. He was in Arizona. It's a 24-hour drive. And I'm like, bet. Let's do it. I'll meet you there at 3 p.m. I drove from Minnesota at 3:00 a.m. to Arizona, no stop. met coffee with this guy, closed that deal, and that changed my life for forever. That was like a year and a half, two years ago. And so massive risk and just like really believe in yourself there. And then the faking it till you make it part is presenting them with opportunity value. So I know some people ask me about a lot of people ask me about outreach and how I find it so easy to close clients. It's all about just the law of resonance. So the main thing that I do to close clients now, and I did this even when I was first starting, is you don't have to go and ask all of your clients for referrals. You actually just have to create resonance. So, I'll reach out to and Hermosi used to do this as well. I'll reach out to all of my clients, mutuals, all of my clients followers and whatnot, people that they're following, and I'll just mention that we did the result for them and they can do the same exact thing. I'll be like, "It would really make sense for you to hop on a call with us right now." Herosa used to go and take a picture with all of his screenshots and he'd be like, "Hey, put this in a group chat with all of your girlies and go and do this." If you can show people the opportunity value and position yourself like you really know what you're doing, you can make money with no money essentially, you know? Yeah. No, no, I completely agree. That's that's hilarious. The Arizona drive story, like that's that's iconic. Yeah. One coffee, bro. I'm going to tell that forever. So, I didn't know how that was going to [ __ ] go, you know what I mean? No, absolutely not. And what? You didn't have the cash at the time to get on a plane, so you drove it? I had like two I had like $2,000. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's uh Yeah, that that's that's solid. Yeah. People ask me, I mean, I don't I've never done the zero to one thing. Like, I've always done like take something existing and scale it. Um, and like a lot I mean I've kind of done some but like same business model. I don't know. I don't really look at like entrepreneurship is an interesting thing cuz it's like everything kind of already exists. There's the people of the world the Elons and whatever create something like completely new or like formulated new but a lot of the time it's just applying a business model to something that is already kind of existing. So I don't know. I don't know. I really look at it as like zero to one but yeah that's uh that's some zero to one behavior for sure. Um what did when did content what I had to make it happen bro? You did dude. Yeah, dude. I respect it. Um, when did this is an interesting one. When did your content start driving sales? So, I assume they mean like the sharing the 1.7 for example. Like that has to generate a bunch of inflow for you, right? Yeah. When I started posting crazy results. So, I posted this tweet. I think it has like 20k views now, which is good for my account. And I was like, and I've told a bunch of people this. Ty wouldn't have followed me if I was just posting that we made like 500k a month or like 600k a month, 700k. The big dogs come after you start posting real big numbers and then you use uh current events that are really popular. So the W video got me followers from from everybody in the info space. I mean big big names like Champs started following me. Big names like Jükasen started following me in the info space. I don't know how many of these guys you started talking to. A lot of guys that you've interviewed started following me from that video. It's because [ __ ] is hot right now. We are number one on [ __ ] So that's status. And then um the I also I also have a video of me sending an 150k wire at 20 years old Miami edition. I think that's what it's captioned. That shows that I have proof that I'm sending out these real big numbers and I'm actually showing I I literally showed the 150k on the on the bank. And then I put um I I literally showed a screenshot of me of the uh like 250k wire being sent to me on all the videos and then the $1.7 million I have it in the liquor studio dashboard. So it's extreme proof. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. I mean, yeah. So, and then they just reach out to you and then you have a very simple sales process, right? I mean, because that's the next question. It's like, "What's your outreach advice? What you handled?" And then like handling sales processes like that's that's a warm inflow like right when they're when they're coming to you first instead. Well, dude, my clients sell for my business right now. Like Q literally puts me in group chats like every single week of people and and clients sell for my business. But if they weren't doing that, I'd do the same approach. So our best my best outreach method was hey I worked with this is very very short but opportunity value first it's like hey I think I know you're running this program let's just call it like sa um I think you can you're sitting on gold right now if you if you did this and by the way I like let's say I'm like you know you could be making an extra 200k just to your top line and by the way I I hit $1.7 million with some of the top traders including Q banks who you follow if you say who you follow it's a mutual beneficial because it's the law of resonance and then you just act super nonchalant with it. Meaning this is why it would make sense for you to hop on a call because I've already did this before something that you follow and um that gets me every time I do outreach I I get results. I'm hopping on a on a call with someone uh tomorrow who's one of the biggest uh creators in the finance space who has been for a while and we're going to hopefully make some good money with that. But I use that approach. Yeah, it's always worked for me, bro. Like no I mean well dude the thing because the hard part is or why I feel like that's like you know USP unique in its way is not really USP but unique is that like you even said it but like fake it make it kind of in the beginning but now you have it you have the proof you have the real proof for the exact specific niche for the exact specific thing like so many people resonate with that when it's you did the exact thing and it fits their exact person or the niche of what they did and like that just that just shows for itself like you don't have to like make these claims or do anything crazy. It's just like, yeah, I sent 100, you know, whatever wire or I'm 20 years old. Oh, we did 1.7 for this. It's like that takes, like you said, and I you I didn't mention this or say anything back on this, but the when you said that we got up to 20K and then refunded everyone, that is like shows a it shows who you are. There are a lot of people who wouldn't refund that and would burn it and like now you've done it where you did probably make another large claim and kind of got your way into it but like actually had the performance and like did the thing and learned from it did the thing and now you are you know eating off of that because you did the thing you have the performance you have the result and yeah I don't know that's like a that's a real good everything from your driving for coffee but like that story arc of being doing that and being crazy uh to having these excuse me having these opportunities where you made money but the guarantees failed and you gave the money back and then doing it again really in a performance-based model where you did get the results and now you're eating off the you like you did it right like you did the thing so like that super yeah that's that's super a clean way to do it in my opinion and I'm from Minnesota like no no nobody really knows where about like hometown friends you have like hometown friends that you'd like still keep up with or no you're just not yeah just just hit exit velocity zero then yeah this is everything to me you know Yeah. No, I love it. I've got uh I've got four like OGs that I'm friends with for like 15 years. We have like you know 300 messages in our group chat a day and it's like they all crush it in their own right. Like we have like mechanical service stuff and like HVAC and whatever and they do you know eight figures and crush but like nothing online. So I have like we have no similarities in there. The only things we can like resonate or talk about the same is like team management or people or like onboarding like because they have to do that in their business. But that's funny. So uh next one on here is how to hype up the launch which you kind of already talked about, right? is like the weight list approach, the hitting them with the list, but like is there anything outside of that that you feel that we didn't cover? Yeah, you have to you have to get an image you have to put an image inside people's heads. So that's usually what we do is is a date. So if you can get people to remember that June 25th something huge is launching on the whisper. June 25th this program is launching. Now you're getting them to remember two things. You're getting them to remember what the actual name of the program is. It'll usually be some like inner circle thing. Everyone names it like the inner circle one program or whatever. um the date. They have to remember the date, June 25th. So, everyone, you should be thinking like, okay, everyone should be thinking like, well, I can't miss June 25th. I can't miss June 25th. Think of like your favorite jewelry brand dropping something um on June 25th. You know that you're going to be awake or like a crypto is calling. The same effect happens there, right? Um and then if you can get them in like a Telegram, I consistently like if you look at our Telegram chats during that time, sometimes I'll literally just say June 25th, be ready. June 25th, don't this. Luke Belmar did this. I would use Luke Balmer as a perfect example because when he dropped that Yeah. when he was dropping what was it? Capital Club. Yeah. Um he basically was like June 25th. Don't miss this. June 25th. Do not miss this. And then when people were joining be like, "Oh, he got in already. Are you going to miss this? Are you going to miss the next drop number 1,225?" And so we we use that after. And we use just extreme urgency and extreme scarcity. And then we'll add benefits to the program. You also have to have benefits. So you have to show them why it's actually different. So So what we'll do, we'll be like this is com this is like the biggest thing that I've ever dropped before because um now you'll be able to get live access to me, live access to exactly what I'm trading. You'll be able to we have to treat um group coaching and and still like the info coaching model like it's an actual system if you can do that. So it'll be like yeah, you'll be able to get the same exact results as me because you're literally watching me do it live and you'll get proprietary access. Um and that's how you hype up the launch. It's like Yeah. Yeah. I love it, dude. That's the core questions on here, but yeah, I I want to pick your brain on some stuff, but like I this I like your approach to things. I like your approach. And there's a couple people I like refer out that do, like I said, there's like the operator kind of model, but then there's also like the launch model. Josh Gavins, for example, I keep using his name, but he's like an OG friend in this space, and he does it around like really like the zero to one portion. Yours is kind of I feel more so like this one to big scale, like these big launches. I think that someone and you know you can be the person who does the launches but then really masters the evergreen. I think that's a huge huge step in like both your LTV the person like the longevity all of that. What I'm trying to like stew on a little bit is how I have this now grouping of people and like what I want to do with it and I we'll probably talk offline more so about it but like I'm I'm I'm building out some things that are kind of a little more similar to this. I just don't want to like struct I don't want to operationally run them. I don't want to build them. I don't want to like you know do any of those pieces because there's people like you there's whatever who go and do that portion but I think there's just like a huge zone in the market right now for putting all these people into like one room putting everyone together the info coaching people the people who are the operators but also people who have like the expert the expert if they're involved right and like you know someone who's actually like at the helm of it so I'm cooking something up and I'll definitely want to uh talk to you about that we can talk offline because I have some actual details and some fun partnership stuff but anything else you want to drop on here for everyone I mean everyone knows where to and you I'm sure X, you got a pretty cool name. It's pretty easy to find you X on Instagram. But anywhere else? Um, I think I think we pretty much covered everything. I mean, watch what I'm doing with I'm going to just be way more transparent about everything that I'm doing apart from info. Yeah, we're going to close some big clients, but I think a lot of people stick in the info realm. I'm not I'm probably going to be working with some big prop firms and brokers here coming up. Um, and then some just really big launches that we're going to be taking more from. So, I want to hit a million dollars a [ __ ] months, man. You know what I mean? I want to get to those. So, dude, you can do it. You can do it. And it's so funny cuz like my plan is to do the opposite, right? I think everyone does try and not everyone, not definitely not everyone, but there are people who try and do that and do info coaching, then go into software, go info coaching. And I liked what you said like the marketing principles carry over, the business model carries over, the team, the operations carry over if you take it to something that's a a better vehicle for, you know, better for no better word, but like you can do these prop firms and it's just bigger dollars, but it's the same flow of what you're doing. My thing is like, okay, to keep my sanity and keep the distractions at bay, I'm like, how can I make info coaching the the the core thing? Um and with that understanding that there's really very very limited equity value unless you have like one of these big ones but like across the space. So yeah just trying to do it in a cool clean way that would be just like cool people in together and then you know the good offers that then turn into businesses keeping them evergreen keeping them in that. So I love the model. I think you're [ __ ] crushing it. You know that's one skill I need to do is just having all of my clients be evergreen because it's just like such a [ __ ] headache, man. Yeah. Yeah. And Yeah. And there's ways to hammer and there's ways to do it with organic and there's ways to do it with paid and there's also ways that you can do it with the monetization model that keeps the cash flow consistent that is doesn't even necessarily have to be evergreen on the front but can be recurring style or like you know Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Well, cool man. All right. Well, people know where to find you. I appreciate you and this was a good one. A good little comeback one that was fully vetted and has the results which I appreciate. So yeah, we'll be in contact. All right. Sweet, man. Good interview. Thanks for having me. Talk soon.
