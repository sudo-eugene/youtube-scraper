# my plan to use youtube to hit $100M/Year ($30M last year) | E14
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCLpayQM7p4

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through my plan for YouTube and how I intend to use the platform so we've done 70 million in cash collected in total through One Singular call funnel uh 30 million of which was last year scaled over 100 employees and the goal of this channel is for me to share what we've tried what we're currently doing um what is broken and how we are currently scaling to 100 million a year in cash collected all right so today I'm going to go through target audience current stats goals plan and then a Biz update uh where we're currently at and just kind of go through how I'm thinking about this YouTube channel specifically so to get into it target audience so industry business owners doing 100K a month and adjacent so what I mean by adjacent is not just call funnel owners not just info and coaching but there's also a lot of overlap on kind of things within the online business that are uh relevant to people who are in physical e-commerce for example or other online chunks and spaces so 100K a month I'm just using as just a rough estimate um because a lot of these things that I share are 2 five 10% lifts at different parts of your funnel or business um and for you to get a ton of the value it really is kind of like more detailed the stuff for like 0 to 10K is not really in my wheelhouse and also a lot of this stuff is just not going to be relevant to them because they have to find product Market fit and all that so really who I'm targeting is this in current state all right so current stats this is one you can write home about but 150 YouTube subscribers and 1,000 on IG so these are the two like conversion numbers or stats I guess that I'm going to use as kpis so the goal here is not 100,000 YouTube subscribers at least not in like current form with the current content it really is just like a Honeypot small zone of people that are in the space that are actually getting value from this not as much like Mass Market 0 to 10K uh fancy edits and clips and all that kind of stuff like that's just not the goal um and then using Instagram more so for the same thing but using it for uh communication and like actual direct following because obviously you can't see like YouTube subscribers necessarily who they are and have good communication so so far um 150 and has been going on whatever a week or something maybe two weeks of content that I've been posting uh and then a thousand on Instagram that are then also coming in through here and I have some crazy stats but like my comment or reach out from view rate is like crazy high right now which is great because that's kind of the goal is just to do that so to go into the goals real goal is to get out of the cave is one right I've been in online marketing for like almost 10 years and have never really shared anything or like come out of the cave um we've been running this business specifically for 5 years six years at this time um and I just haven't shared anything so I think just getting out of the cave and just making these is a huge boost for me personally uh and selfishly so the actual goals of this though in terms of content are network opportunities and talent so what I mean by that is again Network part of the out of the Cave thing terrible super introvert in terms of like networking and a little bit better online but like in person terrible um so being able to find and have a network of people who are also in the space who are also succeeding who can bounce ideas off like this is all I think about all I talk about all the time and it's kind of dry to not have that in your life in any other place and I don't really have this so building out a network is huge so that's why I say like Instagram followers and DMS and seeing stories and back and forth with other people in the space is like huge value to me so definitely trying to grow here as the main from that then comes opportunities so people who are maybe at lower ranks of this or even the same or just getting started like having opportunities that come where someone already has product Market fit and it's like how can I scale this and whether that's something I end up getting financially and business involved with that's one thing or just actually just helping um but over time I see this as you know like this is more or less like an acquisition. comom playay so how horos and them do it they create all this free stuff um ton of free value content and eventually funnels down into um business owners sharing their stuff with them and getting opportunities to do deals with them uh I mean maybe that's a long-term approach but right now it is just like feeling out the network and seeing what happens with opportunities and then Talent is a huge one so without being out and well known whether it's the company or you as an individual uh it could be kind of hard to attract Talent so as we begin to scale we need the best of the best talent within our specific space um there are people who come from outside of the industry and come in and Crush but like tried and true there are people who are in another company or in uh doing their own business for example uh like Ean has a really good video talking about how he has people who will do you know 300K a year in their own starter business but they want to just work somewhere that they can make the same kind kind of income uh without having to have the headaches of like actually being a business owner so being able to find quality talent and people who want to work with you and be a part of your team that work for you um is huge so these are the main goals that I'm looking for um and then if you want to like connect those back to actual stats I don't have a number I don't have if this is 2,000 or 20,000 or what it is but the current like soft metrics is something like 10 to 15% of people that are uh watching the videos are already dming and following and talking which is huge so that's really the goal of this and just beating the drum on that so my plan and how I'm looking at it is raw no fluff no BS no ego um so for a long time definitely had this and I'm glad I kind of shed at least a layer of it and we'll see how much further it goes but I just hate the online stuff that's fluff and like crazy edits and all like there's a time and place for that and especially if you're going Mass market and you're trying to get the click and you're trying to do that but for me it's just not important and it's also not important for the goal right the goal is not to have 100,000 views on something in current form this may change but like that's not the goal I also have don't have anything that's Mass Market that I'm trying to or even like mid-market that I'm trying to offer I'm not trying to sell anything I have no interest in doing that um so I already have people asking for Consulting and stuff like that and like maybe in that realm just because it helps me sharpen it and I also like to just help um but overall the goal is just raw no fluff no BS no ego like here's what's happening now and I'll share some of that in the biz update uh in the trenches actively building so for example like I made a video yesterday about uh sales team comp because I'm inside the sales team dashboards rebuilding things we're talking comp we're talking about how we would adjust it who else is doing it in the space and I just want feelers out and just to be able to like actually show what we're actively doing right I said in the very beginning the goal of this is to get this to 100 million a year in cash collected and Like A lot's going to change and yes we have incredible leaders and team that are doing a lot of stuff that I can do overviews on but like I'm still actively doing things as well like directly um we always call it like clicking the buttons so it's like we're getting things done or you're actually clicking the buttons uh I'm trying to get out of clicking the buttons a little bit more uh as we continue to scale just for True scale and like to make this a machine um but yeah so constantly evolving this is in terms of the actual content so first couple videos audio sucked using a studio display right here and audio sucked and everyone was telling me that it sucked in my DM so got a mic like that's how I'm looking at this is like find the next breakpoint um content is getting pushed out I'm getting whatever 2,000 Impressions let's call it on a video with like a0 2% clickthrough rate cuz the thumbnails the thumbnails or the titles are terrible so what did I do there's a guy reached out to me that said he could do it for XYZ price and he'll do thumbnails and titles for the entire account it's like cool go ahead do it right um zoomed out ugly content I was looking at these docs for example way zoomed out I had all the text already plugged in there so you could see everything and there was no like you know this blacked out section down here and all of this is like you know day over day week over week like I I'm sure I'll look back on this and be like wow these were terrible um but I started and that's really all I care about is that I'm actually just doing it um so that's what I mean here by zoomed out ugly content rambling plan content okay so like even just putting this document together versus just opening a spreadsheet and kind of riffing live is in the right direction it could be a lot better right like my packaging of how I'm doing this could be a lot better uh but this is the initial State and just kind of how I'm able to do it every single day as of now and maybe that'll change to a couple times a week but getting into building in public it might not be a couple times a week because there's constantly stuff happening so right now it's just like info there's a way to maybe make it into like infotainment but again that's like a whole team or job or something that I don't know that I'm really looking to do or interested in at this time um but what I mean by building public is the videos aren't as much like Evergreen in the way that like how to get your first 10,000 followers on Instagram right like that video can be watched at any point and it's the sameish style what I'm looking to do is more so like vlogging is a good example like in the Life uh like real time because I want to be able to do like real updates and be able to be okay yesterday we did x amount of cash collected or these stats or this last month we did this and I think that'll be super valuable for people to see like where our evolution is and what we're doing and also for to look back and be like where did we fail where did we succeed oh 6 months ago we had these stats what happened and change cuz now they're down like being able to do that with the real goal here have 100 million cash collected all right so this is not that out of touch especially how we're changing things with acquisition um with with our acquisition model um so I think this is like super realistic and what we're targeting the timeline I you know definitely not in 2025 I wouldn't see it as unless we hit some like crazy scale um but into the next year I could see it um real behind the scenes like I said and then I need to figure out a better way but I want to be able to build in public but in order to show stuff sometimes there's like customer info or team info and I don't feel comfortable sharing that because like they didn't sign up for this and that's just not allowed so um I need to figure out by way here but that's the general gist of like how I'm looking at this so if I was to get to 2,000 or 5,000 or whatever of like actual proper business owner following um there's a lot of great guys who do it like uh Ravi has a good Channel his a little bit more mass Market he has an offer um Jeremy Haynes has one that's really good but his is like Advertiser kind of specific but all about call funnels getting to a million a month um he has really good content like so they are targeting specific buckets of the pocket um or Pockets like within the market uh which I love so that kind of style um but in current state their stuff is a little bit more edited up than mine and maybe I'll get there or want to get there but in current state I don't want to so um that's where we're at and then Biz update this is where I want to go and talk about where I'm saying like info uh real updates all this so Biz update and current state so last year we did 30 million cash collected uh last month and like current state is 1.5 million a month okay so like not good right so I want to be able to share like fluff and or no fluff no BS about that so for us currently it's our show rate our close rate and like also the quality for marketing it's that it's that dance I talk about in other videos about marketing and sales so we study State got to 3.8 I think was our Peak month in 2024 and again over the entire year it was like 30.5 million in cash collected uh and right now we're trending you know whatever that is 4.5 million a quarter like not good 20 million so for us right now we're having a show rate issue so our show rates are 45 to 50% we changed a bunch of stuff automation broke things are uh trending or not trending uh um showing on Google result if you look up like our brand name so we're having like all these issues around that close rate is a sales team issue that we're just having in general so that is everything from vibe made other videos about like um the comp model and how it can not necessarily in incentivize correctly so like we're looking at tons of different things on how to solve for this but if I was just to look at the marketing side for example it's like okay so we could do better quality because the biggest complaint from sales which always will be but right now it's definitely like a little bit hotter is the quality and then also the shows so shows in the we currently look at them as like a marketing thing not a salesperson thing which I'm back and forth on but like that's how we've done it forever because it's all the automations it's the framing like there is a marketing portion um but sales really has like no responsibility for it at all um and that I think is an issue so not having any like control or feeling like they have control and getting just 50% of their bookings just taken off their calendar because people don't show up or cancel is like not ideal um so when we were truly crushing we head it at like 55 60% um and I've heard of people going to 70 80% it's just something we've never solved for so their close rate their live call close rate is down as well so it's not even just so that that could be you know quality as well so all to say marketing is working on this and doubling down and what we're doing marketing is uh we're transitioning to just better like we just had a new CMO come in that is an absolute rockar in the space and he's like a week in so none of this is reflective of that um so in a month I could say oh cool we're at 3 million right like it's that quick of a a flip of a switch that could happen um because calendars are 80% booked but the actual um the close rate and like the sales per booking is down so if we just solve for that and it's not necessarily just that but if we just saw for sales for booking and went back to our normal rates we would be at 3 million a month like it's that simple um and it's that simple but it's not that easy so with marketing we're doing new things we're doing low ticket so we just launched that and uh with low ticket we're doing Setters as well so booking in as that uh post call or I'm sorry postp purchase call that they can go in and they'll talk to a Setter um then they talk to a Setter get pushed on a closure calendar so ideally that's higher intent because or higher quality because they're a buyer not a lead they have then also been set and been qualified so ideally what you think is the math backs out that you have higher show rates higher close rates more qualified person and that whole chain of events now we're also doing this with Setters on the current vssl funnel so finding drop off in the app not booked um and then also we're almost there but we're going to likely take like direct bookings that would come from either DQ or from anywhere in the automations and instead of instead of putting them straight to closers vet them through so only allowing the whatever percent of people to come through that already qualify and hit all the boxes and have the intent to book a call and then anyone else that we're trying to like recapture or push back through automations um and that's email and SMS and all those pieces uh pushing them to Setters to get qualified so that's the goal that's where we're at right now um I know this is kind of like more of a selfish or just like me video but I think it's important just to share like what the goals are and just kind of how I'm thinking about it uh CU anyone can do this and I just forever uh put this off and didn't do this part right and uh I wish I would have so now we're here so again subscribe go on Instagram for communication and following there and uh drop any comments below this uh if you have any questions or want me to talk about anything specific so I will talk to you guys soon bye
