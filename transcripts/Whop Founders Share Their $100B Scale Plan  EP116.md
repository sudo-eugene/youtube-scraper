What's up, chat? We are on day 116 in a row and I've got the [ __ ] co-founders, Stephen and Cameron. I'll let you guys intro. I'm sure everyone who follows me already knows who you guys are, but kick it off. Yo, who we got? What's up? I'm Stephen. Thank you, Ryan, for having us. What up, Cameron? Very excited. And Cameron's in what? New York. Stephen, you're out. I'm in SF right now. Cool. Yeah. No, we've uh we've touched base a couple times. I flew out there like a year ago and got to meet these guys and still never done anything work direct related, but crushing it with financing, crush crushing it with all payments and then crushing it with hosting. So yeah, I asked a bunch of people questions, but I kind of just want to kick it off with like what I mean I know kind of some background story, but like you guys came together, we're already friends before. I heard sneaker things. I heard trading group. Like what was the initial start of this? Yeah, we we met on Facebook and we basically spent all of our high school building like every single type of business on the internet you could imagine. I mean we we built consumer SAS products, we built messaging apps, we built marketplaces, we bought and sold ship from Amazon, from China on Amazon, eBay, and I mean I think we just really realized how much power the internet can bring to to making money. Uh so so that that's what we did. And uh then we we we uh started working on [ __ ] in in the beginning of COVID and um we had a bunch of uh old sneakerbot software that that uh we we sold when we were younger and there was all these forums that people were buying and selling it and they're cash apping each other, VMOing each other. It's this really shitty system. So we built [ __ ] as a way for us to sell our own product uh our own software products. Um and uh it started to to grow from there. And I mean people started asking for things like let's let me sell access to discord, let me sell access to a telegram and and uh went beyond just software and then I mean I think through that process uh we we we've come to [ __ ] today. Nice. Yeah. No, I uh so I'm I have Lucat's coming on on Wednesday but my first iteration to this world was helping him build like a WordPress site like saw a story of his he was like I need a WordPress dev which I am frankly not but I know how to build like WordPress sites. So I was like, "Oh, I can do it." And he was like, "I have guys that'll do it by Wednesday." And I was like, "I'll do it tonight." And I literally was on I was on a date. I stayed up that entire night, shipped it to him at like 4 in the morning, sent it to him, and he was like, "You want percentage of XYZ thing?" And it was Discord plugged to payments. And I didn't understand how that worked. Like he was on different, you know, authorizing those together. So I was like hiring random Upwork devs and trying to like create things. Ended up on ChargeB so we could do like a two-way. And I literally Cam, you texted me yesterday in that group chat and I had you in my phone already as Cam Discord and you and I had text from like 2021 that or 2022 or something that was in there and I was like, "Dude, where's the context of this?" And like I've met you multiple times but never one-on-one text you and I was like, "Oh, that must be like how funny is that?" So yeah, it goes all the people that did all the people that did agencies and webdev I think are different breed. I mean you had to go through so much [ __ ] That's crazy. L Capitan. Well, you worked with El Capitan. Dude, I wor I don't even know who I worked with back in those days in 2022. That's so funny. Yeah, dude. Isn't that crazy? So, like Yeah. And you sent me a link. It was like dash.wop. And I was like, "Look at me. Shoot myself for now knowing where you guys sit valuation wise we could have done cuz I was doing the same back then just with like different context." So, um, no, let's just get into it. I mean, everyone can find your beginner stories and you guys do fun pods and whatever. Let's just jam. We jam for like what, an hour before this already, so you guys missed all the saucy sauce, but we can uh we can go into some more fun stuff. So Hunter wants to know uh why you guys are so handsome. So that's a good that's a good kickoff. Um talk about how company and creators are using clipping to scale faster. So everything you guys are doing with content rewards. Where did that come from? Uh yeah. Yeah. Cam, you you want to? Yeah, I can take you there. Um I think we became there. It's kind of like the the history of [ __ ] as a business is we find these like unstructured markets and random parts of the internet. So like Stephen mentioned, we first started [ __ ] there were already people buying and selling sneaker bots at Discord servers and these random forums and then we just productized it and I think clipping as a model um Andrew Tate kind of like pioneered this a couple years ago when he got banned in a lot of social platforms. He just started giving everyone all his content um and started incentivizing them based on the amount of views that they got and also an affiliate program. So um we built content rewards just as an app on W that anyone can install and really like incentivize your fans and your your user base to go get more content. And with the way social set up nowadays doesn't really matter how many followers you have. Um all that matters is is your quality engaging. If you post engaging pont get boost. So um we launched that and it's just a cool it's one of many apps in the app store. It's a cool way people drive distribution. Yeah. I mean it's a it's a we we usually think of ways our mission as a company is to help people earn sustainable income on the internet and this is like probably the most modern way to attract customers. Um so yeah that's what clipping is all about. Yeah, we've thought about doing it, but for us it was like one, we have sales calendar like batching. So, you have an issue with like throttling. If you get over easy math, 100 bookings a day, like your stuff breaks because there's nowhere for them to book. So, like if you hit virality through something, it's almost a bad thing if you don't have a direct toart offer or like somewhere they can go to convert. So, like we've ran into that we're like, "Oh, we don't want to do it yet. We don't want to do it yet until we have something cold friendly." But I see people crush with it on your especially like on your guys' stuff. I I I think maybe one of the um interesting things is that it doesn't always have to drive conversions. We found just pure awareness is actually like really really powerful through clipping. So So that that's what we've seen a lot of really good good value be created from. Yeah, 100%. So when and the the other follow-up question to this was best practice people see clipping. So what are they uploading and how is that like authority content? Is it long form testimonial? I mean, obviously, I'm sure the controversial stuff pops off, but like what's the best there? I I think that the the content wise, I mean, you can kind of um have a lot of content um that that you curate, but I think that the the main thing to know on how to how to do the best clip clipping is uh to really curate who's actually clipping and who's actually posting content. You can't just let in a bunch of random people to to do clipping, right? Because they're representing your brand and I mean, you definitely don't want to pay for lowquality [ __ ] So, so I think that that the most successful campaigns we've seen are uh really curated groups of of content creators that come on and I mean you can you can throw a lot of content up and and they can kind of figure out what what works because they're really good at it. Uh but I think the key is to to curate who's actually going to be clipping and and making user generated content. Yeah. No, that makes sense. Yeah. Because we the exact same thing. We're like what do we upload into here? Who do we allow it? We have a certain demo. It's like do we want to be vastly across everywhere? So we'll definitely be on there once we're ready for it. But um okay, now let's get into payments. There's a lot of questions around this. So high-risisk versus low risk in payment processing and how do you see each evolving in the space? Um yeah, I mean Kim, maybe I've been doing a lot a lot of this recently, so I'll just um say how I see it and then you can go. But I I think um I mean risk in payments is purely chargebacks, right? So the only risk with payments is is um is this merchant going to have a lot of chargebacks? And I think that the the way to combat that is is really just to um to iterate on how we do reserves. So I think that I mean our goal is to let almost every single business so long as it's it's a legal business and in the jurisdiction that it operates to accept payments. It's kind of crazy how black boxy the payments world is. And it's very unfair that I mean you could be a a a cupcake shop and and have trouble accepting payments now. So so I think that our goal is to make everybody allow everybody to process payments. Um, on the risk side, I think we're just going to iterate and and evolve how we actually do reserves because I mean, if so, you're going to come on our platform and and uh and we don't know, you have no history with us. You don't have anything filled out on your page. It's very hard for us to actually know if if you're if you're a healthy merchant or not. So, I think we have to just evolve our our um reserve policies. And I mean, we're going to try to do our best and communicate what those are clearly. But, that's how I see the future of both payments generally. I mean it's not like we have a separate uh workflows for high risk and and low risk. We we treat it as um as a critical part of our business to make sure that everybody can can process payments. Yeah, that makes sense. And then people are so why build I mean I think you guys have talked about this in the past when I've watched some of your stuff you built on straight for ease in the beginning but why not or is it in the road map to start your own MSP? I mean, at the end of the day, I think that people really like they want cheap fees. They want reliability, right? Like there's not much more you can ask for in the payments world. And I think that we're going to make sure that people get both those two things. So, if that means if that means Stripe, if that means something else, I think we have a lot of a lot of really awesome people on our team that are uh working on on this type of stuff and and I'm pretty confident that we're going to come with an amazing solution long term. And that's a pretty much one of the main things we talk about all day. So, uh, I I'd say like you can expect reliability and and really really cheap processing rates as far as how how it actually is implemented. Um, time will tell and and I don't have a public answer right now. Yeah. No, fair. We're uh I like to take these and just use these selfishly too and everyone shits on me in the comments like Ryan, you talk too much or you talk about this and I don't care because they don't have to listen. Um, but like for us right now, we're fully on one payment processor. We're fully keeping all of our subscriptions in there which is like a major risk point, right? So like we do have backup mids that would plug in for the new section but like the actual token like everything's stored in one. So we're like okay we need this pop essentially somewhere that will store all those and then how do we use that with like source of truth with all of our other stuff. So we're working in that direction and like last I talked to you guys you were doing you know something similar obviously at a 50,000 time X scale where you have like multiple distribution across different payments so you don't you know get that but people are asking in here so like what is the future of payment sector se sector in that regard like is it you guys just like you're the one-stop shop and then everything gets sourced between there and you just handle it on your end like everything you're doing right now with payments is it you have multiple vendors is it like what's the what's the target there? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I I think that's like a common misconception with with payments is that like is that it's um people think that Stripe, for example, isn't on your side or or that you have all these other um acquirers that are not necessarily on your side, but the reality is like they actually are on your side. And it's really Visa, Mastercard, and MX that that I think um people really want to make sure are um are following their guidelines and and um staying close with them to to ensure that people can have relationships and and uh be allowed on those networks. And I uh I mean the future of W payments is is like that of extreme resilience and um and really cheap fees. I think that there's like a lot of a lot of uh ways to do that. And I mean I can't I can't say exactly how we're approaching it, but um we are very aware and uh tapped into the payments world and I mean our history is is very deep payments. I mean that that's like Cam and I started building on Stripe in like 2011 and I think we we saw the rise of of Brainree and and Square and Addy and Shopify and How old were you in 2011? Uh I was like maybe 13 or Yeah. Yeah. Have the parents open a Stripe account and and maybe try to get get on a PayPal as well. And I I mean we we we were we uh you sent Bitcoin to to our developers in in Bangladesh when we were growing up. And I mean very bullish on crypto as the future of payments in a lot of ways. So I I think the next couple years are going to be pretty awesome. Um and I mean our our as I said earlier like it's very critical part of our mission to have the best payments in on the internet and I think that we're going to do that. Um so that's what people can expect payments wise. Yeah. Yeah. So for you guys I mean you super oversimplification. You have hosting side of things where people can host their course, their community, communication, all of that. And you have payment side, right? And payment side and at least in my perspective is where a lot of people come over because you have all these crazy like direct financing options. You just make it simple, right? You have it simple and it's plug-and-play. The direct to cart for financing by the way is like night and day. Like that is a beautiful thing that like something like we when we do ours, it's an approval that then either comes in a it's separate. It's different than how you accept all their payments. So it almost like doesn't connect to your source of truth in the same way because it's not direct to cart uh financing which is one thing and then the only other way to get around that is to do the virtual cards. So people get approved for XYZ financing don't need a docs they get a virtual card they check out through our system we as a company pay financing here and then we pay processing here. So we get like double fee stacked which like is very interesting and like I I mean what you guys have is very very cool in that way. So as you guys have built this I'm curious about you two as individuals. So like right now I just briefly saw an X, but what is it? CGO and CEO. Is that what you guys call it right now? So Cam, you sit more on team growth piece. Stephen, you sit I mean like how much overlap is there? Like more so I guess the better question is like you were here and as you guys came up, do you live in different worlds? Is there a ton of overlap on what you do? I'm sure. But like how is that navigated? Yeah, I can stop at it. I think there there's still like an ex um there's still a lot we're all building the same company, so there's still like a ton of overlap. I would say uh I'm probably a little bit more in the weeds of like the day-to-day. So I'll work closer with like our growth teams predominantly sales and marketing. Um and then on the product side, more of like the core hosting product side, Stephen is technical by nature. I'm not technical. So Stephen like if there's a deep engineering problem, Stephen will go in and solve it versus me. Um most of the growth related things I'm able to dive into. And then um on the product side, I'll handle most of like the day-to-day. And then um Stephen his ability to think long term is just like amazing. So he'll come in and kind of like oversee everything, ensure we're making the right long-term decisions. Um it's kind of hard. Yeah. Yeah. I I spend a lot of my I think that I mean when we Kim and I first met I was engineer, he was go to market and I think that the same kind of thing rings true now. And um if we're going to uh have a separation of of like what we do, it's it's anything that's um extreme architectural whether it's like our pro our business or our our system or our our marketing. anything that that's like that I I'll I'll maybe try try to focus on. And then Cam is like master of execution, just relentless in every single uh anything we're doing. Um we we have a I think a very rare and and uh like very lucky relationship. Um honestly, yeah. No, it's amazing. It's amazing. So I know I mean I I Googled quick and I think the last one what's the last public valuation? 300. Is that the last public one? It's actually uh we actually have done a pretty we we don't really get that excited by announcing our fund raise fundraises. I think it's just like a little bit distracting and I mean our customers don't really care how much money we raise and our goal is not to raise money but I mean we actually ra we actually um last June we we uh raised at an 800 million valuation um that I don't think we really ever ever released uh but it's gotten leaked a couple times by different Twitter accounts but uh the last public valuation was last June at 800 million. Um that was a year ago. So we we probably are um higher now, but uh that's that's the last viation. Yeah. So like what's what is the game plan here? I mean obviously you guys are builders, right? So like you just said like it's distracting at some level, but there's a target, right? You have something in mind. You're going in some direction whether that doesn't have even have to be a number, but it's uh business is at XYZ, it's X amount of customers, X whatever. So like is this let's ramp this thing to 100 billion and go public. Is this a let's sell this thing completely outright to somebody at the right thing? Is this no, we want to build for years and years to come and we're going to be like where do you guys see that? I think we we have like a internal northstar of we want to make a million millionaires. So we we want to have uh a million people on our platform that that have made million dollars or more. Um so so that's a pretty long way away. I think maybe maybe not. I think we can we can make it come faster. But um we're definitely in this for the long run. I uh I think we we view raising money and going public and all that as part of the uh means to to the goal and uh and not the goal. So so I I I would be I think it's much much uh more in line with with the first outcome you said is is make it really big and uh maybe go public later and and uh give all of our customers and and um whatnot chance to to have ownership in our in our company as well. I think is very exciting to us. Uh but but our our number one goal is to to make people money and and that's Northstar million people a million dollars. Yeah. Million million millionaires. We just like grew up building the most random [ __ ] in the world and I think Steve and I will both probably work until the day we die and just building [ __ ] And um there's nothing more fun. Like we literally had the most random businesses growing up. Like we'd be selling sneakers, a month later we're selling PlayStation controllers, a month later we're trying to figure out how to flip crypto. So the ultimate goal of [ __ ] is like support every business in the world. So, um, it's definitely not sell anytime soon. We want to build this [ __ ] until we die. Yeah, I kind of got that vibe when it was 10 p.m. on 4th of July and you and I are DMing on X and then moving it to iMessage and then we're doing this at 400 p.m. on a random Sunday or holiday weekend. I was like, "Yeah, cool. These are my people." Like, I get it. I get it. It's the only way. Literally the only way. So, I I'll shut up about the investor stuff after this and the whatever cuz I've had I've had two taken down now by the Matrix of my videos because people have had like basically sent to me or they've been sent to that been like, "Hey, can you take that down? I said XYZ and I don't edit and oops and like they didn't care at the time and then they cared after. So, we'll be cognizant of that so you guys don't have to put be be put in a bad position." But like you've had some pretty strategic investors too, right? You got the Eman stuff that's very public. You have some other like A-list top people. like is that strategy? Is that capital? Is that I mean obviously both, but like do they lean in on strategy? Are they more like hands off and you guys are just running this thing to the moon? Um or is there like a cadence around that? Because I've never just for context I've never raised, we've never sold anything like obviously we're moving that direction, but like I just operate, we just build and we've never done anything with outside capital. We've never done any of that world. Yeah. I mean I think the way we look at it is is we want to surround oursel is with people that are going to push us and um that that means that people can bring us new perspective. they can introduce us to people. So, people that that are going to generally be able to do that, we're really excited about working with and that's how we've decided to who to who to partner with from past fundrais. Um, as far as like day-to-day and strategy, we have quarterly board meetings um with people that are on our board and that's a really awesome checkpoint for us internally just to say, hey, like are we making good progress? What what are our plans for the next few months? Are we on track? And um it's a really good forcing function to get all our [ __ ] together. So I I uh I think in that regard that's that's the level that's some the most that they play um from a like are we how are we operating day-to-day so just quarterly board meetings and other that other than that I think everybody's are pretty everybody is pretty hands-off and and uh lets us cook. So, so I uh yeah, we try to make sure that people are are strategic as possible when we're raising money and then um when we're operating, I mean, we maybe sometimes ask them for help, but usually it's us giving them updates and and I think we look at them to maybe force ourselves to have a little bit of accountability and like are we on the right track and and so on. I think it's helpful. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. So, Cam, when like in the in the office, I've been in there, it is just the grind station. You've got your water machine with 12 different flavors and sparkling or not. You've got constant food in there. Those guys are just grinding and you guys live in buildings around like surrounding it like constant go- go. What is the team stack? You said it's marketing, it's sales, it's dev. Yes. Like kind of that. But like is there hierarchy? Is there like 22 direct reports to one person? Because sometimes that honestly is more efficient. Like you hear the Nvidia guy talk about that, right? Where he's got like all these direct reports that live in that world. Like there's different structures, but like how do you guys run this as young dudes that you know, not in a bad way, but have no direct experience doing it other than building through it, which me too, right? It's not like I like got trained somewhere to do it and I have as much, you know, we have 140 people or whatever, but it's like my direct report. It doesn't sit like yours does. Like it's it's Yeah. Yeah. It's admirable. Yeah. The I think we were we're in the process of evolving a little bit, but I think for the last four years has pretty much just been get as many smart people from the internet in a room as possible and all cook together. And that's really like when we when we moved to we started the company, Steve and I and one of the co-founders Shark and we were just on Zoom all day and then we moved to New York and we had a three-bedroom apartment that we got to about 10 people um all living there at the same time. That was our office and we just would wake up everyone we have one bathroom like everyone's living or two bathrooms, everyone's living in there doing the same thing every single day. So I think that culture um we've scaled quite well and then I think where we're at right now the product is just quite large like over hund00 million a month in processing volume for a million monthly active users. So um really over 100 million a month active users now. Oh no, no, one 100 million in processing volume. 1 million monthly active. Oh, still both. Okay. I was like, what the I was like, wait a minute. Yeah. So, I think where we're going to right now, there's no like there's not a ton of hierarchy to be honest. Like the way it works right now, we have like 13 core services at our company. You have marketing is one of them. You have um the enterprise stuff that Hunter and them are doing is another one of them. You have the engagement side of our product. So, there's 13 core services. Each one has an owner. The owner owns metrics. Um they report to the entire company on Friday. We have like a team all hands where um they show demos of what they ship that week and they report on their metrics and then every Thursday before that we have a meeting with Steve, myself and the team lead and they're presenting what did you get done this week, how are we doing towards our metrics and that meeting is really used to like show what was done and all just put our hat together of like how can we be growing faster and how can we make this more effective. So um up until a couple weeks it was really like pretty flat I would say like everyone just contributing where they see fit and now this new ownership structure I think gives people more control over a surface. is they have a set of budget. They have clear metrics they own and it's kind of I think like most of the people at WAP built businesses on the internet. You have a lot of entrepreneurs. We want to foster that environment. We want people to not feel like they're a part of some 9 to5 bureaucracy. It should be people come in and you're an entrepreneur over the service you own and let's build a massive [ __ ] company that helps people make a ton of money on the internet. So yeah, that's kind of I I tweeted the other day like I just like to build cool [ __ ] with my friends. And I I think that that we we started out and it was literally just like we traveled together, we ate together, we worked together. It's just so fun. Um, and and I think the second you try to think that work and life are different is when you kind of go go downhill. So, so that's definitely the motto. And I mean, yeah, as Cam said, like we try to is any micro if we're micromanaging is is what people are doing. I think it's something's arai and and not so good. So, I think we we try to work with killers and who who have strong stances on what they think is right and what they think they should do. Um, and uh it's much more fun to to work with those types of people. Yeah, 100%. Interesting. I Dude, sometimes I feel like we get like so corporate and some of the stuff we do now and it's like already there and it like irks it irks and like that the work life balance dive and like we have all these W2 and it's all I mean you guys are all uh a lot US but obviously international as well and like there's just like a difference there, right? And there's uh I was in a Slack channel the other day. I've talked about this like five times, but there was like six people in a Slack channel. It took us 5 days to make a decision around what we were going to name some links on something. And I got so frustrated and like love the team and like everyone's trying to give good input but like at some level it was like can we just decide just like ship quick and just like break [ __ ] and like continue to move in that direction and every time I feel like we're going the other way. I'm like no just hired a project manager and I was like if you slow us down like we're no like we need no no QA. No, we're not doing that. Like we're just we're going we're going. All right, this is a fun one and I don't I'm going to reword this because it's kind of like but what percentage of sellers are running real businesses versus side hustles and then they said versus scams which don't even [ __ ] listen to that. Are you more of a discovery platform or or an infrastructure layer? So the first question I stand by this because it's like a lot of people run offers. You'll always hear in like our info coaching land it's like what offer are you on? What offer are you on? Not like what business are you in? And I do think there is a distinction there like someone pumps an offer, it turns into like a business and then there are guys who hit like what we were talking about before that's like exit velocity where it's like a big big business like it's info coaching plus maybe other things or just like large info coaching. So how many do you guys see and maybe it's a dollar value maybe that's a team size like where would you see the breakdown? Yeah. Yeah. So, so I think maybe I think maybe um 1,200 or maybe maybe almost 1,500 people I guess um a month earn more than $10,000 a month. And that that to us is like that's real money. And that means that they're definitely doing this full-time. Um and I mean our our goal as a platform is not to allow people to like make a couple dollars here and there. It's very much to give people a way to earn a living. And um that's our aspiration. I mean, we definitely have a good amount of people that are I guess running real businesses versus side hustles. I I do want to address the scam point because I think I think it's it's it's a a good question and I mean I think that there there's a lot of scams on the internet and I mean we we um I think that the thing I've learned is that just because you think something is a scam um doesn't necessarily mean that everybody would agree with you and especially when you talk to the customers that are purchasing a lot of the stuff that you maybe you would consider is is a scam. Uh they actually don't think so. And I mean you you we I've uh hung out with a lot of people and myself included who've purchased a lot of things on the internet that many people would call a scam and um it turns out to be actually pretty awesome. So we definitely have scams on the platform that we try to take down immediately and we have a good reporting and we're building out a lot of trust and safety stuff. Um and uh yeah so so that's that's what I tell you about the scam stuff. Um the the second question um what was the second question? Discovery versus are you guys more of a discovery platform or an infrastructure layer? Um We're right now we're an infrastructure layer. We started as a discovery platform and I um I think that we're going to get back towards that over the long run. Um we have some really cool stuff uh planned up up our sleeve around the discovery layer, but um right now I think the the real value of [ __ ] is in the infrastructure layer. Yeah, makes sense. Um all right, back to people. So how do you guys attract such strong talent early on? like I feel like you guys have we were at uh Iman's mastermind in London and someone came over to the table and was like yeah I just feel like they're all clones and we're like what do you mean it's like dude they all have like you know what people call like the mission or like the principles or whatever like ingrained in them to where you guys are all kind of like saying the same thing you know you got yours and your hunters love them right like they're like a great example of like they're so close to the fire that like you got but I feel like almost all of you are right there's so many ex accounts that are like some way connected to you guys or whatever and like you're all like moving the ball together almost. So like how did you get these people early and how like have you kept them close to the fire in terms of all these things? Yeah, I think how we I mean we we honestly were just like so I mean how we met Hunter for instance is like we we had there was an NFT portion of our company. We were just trying and in the spirit of like experimentation like we just tried so much [ __ ] and Hunter was in that space and like we met him and we started working together on completely random [ __ ] He was trying to help us grow like the NFT side of our business and then it turns into more. I think how we like we the we've done our best recruiting for the most part getting attracting people from the space or users and it's really just by being in the trenches like talking to people every single day and then just like people want to like Stephen said people want to build cool [ __ ] with their friends and it's much more you can build like I had like I we we ran like paid communities before we started this we sold software and stuff like that but building like a platform and ecosystem is hard and it's kind of like infinite ceiling um so I think it's really finding people who understand the space well and are really passionate and want to to build really big banks and I think in terms of how everyone's super aligned on the principles and all of that. Um I mean we all like the first the first 10 11 people of the company we all live together for the first two years. So I think it's just like so ingrained and as you hire more people um Hunter has a team of seven people now but like we lived with Hunter for two years and we're so connected at the hip where um we might not be in the room but we're all so severely aligned. Um, so how Yeah. I mean, I think it's also like we we've we've had a lot of people not work out, too. And and I mean, I think that the the uh part of building a a culture that um is is defined as like saying no to to a lot of things that maybe uh dilute it and um and make it a little bit messy. So, I mean, we have weekly weekly all hands. We we have uh heavy inoff presence. We don't have a remote company. Um, and I think those things are are uh really helpful in in defining what what culture we want to build. Um, and plus having culture of just pure internet uh is usually more aligned than not. I mean, everybody kind of speaks the same lingo and laughs at the same things and uh knows the same meta. So, yeah. Yeah, 100%. And you guys are hiring right now. I told these guys no shilling. We were jokingly talking a little bit before. We were talking sponsorships. we were talking things and uh no but I do think that like you're it's going around literally on X right now that you guys are hiring around this because it's such a good offer and like we could talk about how we're going to do this after the fact but like I do think this is probably fair time like you guys are building something crazy and Cam what are you guys tweeting about what is this offer you guys like who are you looking for to grow this team right now? Yeah. So, I mean what we're the main thing um predominantly right now is like more engineers and more um sales reps to help scale on the growth side, but on the sales rep side we what we were talking about offline is the goal is if people hit full quote is about like 340k total comp per year plus equity [ __ ] and um the role is just helping on board like like Stephen said we want to make a million millionaires. So, um we need an army of people helping on board the masses to WP. So, um that's cool. Yeah. No, I mean literally I saw like six tweets that were people talking about it and FYI guys, I told these guys they got to send me 100 grand for me to say it on here because I don't shill anything. Uh so TBD on that. Uh but no, literally that is a crazy offer and it's essentially to what be a Hunter Ari style because a lot of guys know those guys. Yeah. So like Iman has a good like I've heard great talks about this. I keep saying his name because like I I'll talk to him pretty frequent about a lot of this stuff now. But like he there's a lot of people in our info coaching land that are entrepreneur, marketer, opera, whatever, live in this that get 30 grand a month, 50 grand a month, 100 grand a month, but there are 92 things you have to do in order to like run your own thing, right? and like what you could do there within your guys' organization or how Iman was talking about it within his organization like it's almost like a notch on the belt to then go work in something like what you guys have because the experience you get paid to learn you get paid to like do all these things next to the fire close to the fire grow in this like crazy way and I don't know I mean I would take that off for any of those guys who are kind of like in those trenches that are in the 30 50 100 like there is power in shutting down your thing to go and work in something that you're closer to all these people who are already doing a million a month who are building in software where like I just that's my that's my two cents about it. Like I think it's a very valuable offer and land to just hang out with you guys and like the team and what you're building. So jump to the next one. But I honestly appreciate that so much and No, no, no, dude. It's like it's aing real thing. Like I and we take people too. Like we would we take people too like I have people who are like, "Oh, I'll shut down my thing and come work with you." And I'm like, "Don't do that for like what they want to work for me to do." But like if it was if I was building in the world of kind of what you guys are doing, it would make a lot of sense for someone to shut something down that is frankly an offer not a business and they are going to jump to something new in 18 months or whatever and like iterate. They're going to learn faster. They're likely going to get paid more. They're going to have more upside like these things. So like end of the shill, which is not even a [ __ ] chill. It's just like legit. Um but yeah, so serious. Um next one on here, world of vibe coding and solo app development. What industries are going to be most disrupted? I see all this [ __ ] all the time. I have like stayed away from it. But like what do you guys see with that? Uh I software is generally just becoming a lot more commoditized and that means it's not it's no longer uh the bottleneck is is no longer the bottleneck is no longer on execution. Um it's much more on the quality of thought and it it becomes how uh creative can you be and and how thoughtful can you be as to what you build um versus the execution of building that thing. So I think that the industries that are going to be disrupted, I mean you already have like more websites than ever being created. The the the idea of like an agency may shift from being pure web development to being like, hey, like what actual product should we build here and and doing some discovery on that lens. So I mean I I think all the industries are are getting kind of disrupted right now. Every AI is just literally lifting every single quality bar up a little bit uh across the board. So, I I think it's pretty cool stuff that's going on, but I I don't think it's like, oh my god, everybody's going to get uh their their uh their job taken. I think it's more more just a little bit of an evolution of of thinking and um and that's what we're seeing now with vibe coding and all AI more broadly. Yeah, you guys were kind of pumping it a little on X and I saw it and then obviously Stephen, you spoke about it when you were in London. But I think what you guys are doing with like the marketplace app store, like the Shopify essentially for info and like at some level is so cool that like people can make so much money doing that. Like you hear there are so many podcasts where the guys talk about how they were like first to Shopify uh to make all the themes and do all that kind of stuff and like bagged and became some like the largest agencies became some of the largest. Like I don't know why cuz doesn't that kind of fall and this is kind of like where I'm getting out of my realm a little bit but like some of these vibe coding things solo app development like that can plug right into what you guys have right yeah I mean there's a lot of Shopify app agencies that are now multi-billion dollar companies and I I would would be um that's definitely our goal as well is to to have that happen and I think it will um the vibe coding and and uh uh coding infrastructure that's been that's been fueled by AI is uh can now be plugged directly into [ __ ] So I mean if you if you have an idea for something that um you've wanted [ __ ] to do, you can now just build it directly into the platform and and um without even talking to anybody on our team. So yeah, it's really really exciting. It's W app store is uh it's growing pretty fast without without a lot of um without a lot of pushing it um so far and I'm I'm that's definitely like one of the most bullish things that I think we we've made ever. Um so very very excited about that. Yeah, there's a lot of guys I know that will do some one guy specific I know that works and he'll put basically all his offers on your guys' platform and majority will do it on payments but he'll do some of them on hosting and like we have certain things that were like oh we want to see these numbers or oh we want to roll out this feature and now he's like oh it's cool cuz I built it here and instead of having to like basically export and do stuff that he was doing in sheets and living over there he basically just what I think it was like four or five grand he paid to have something built I don't know if he released it even public but like just the private side of it then he could put it within Yeah. And then he had the same stats across each of them and like it looked the same. And like that's my land, right? Is like data and dashboards. Like if I can have the same picture of and what we were talking about before this if someone was like a growth operator, it's like what are the stats for this that all looks the same across all of my WOPS and not have to worry about you guys and like feature requests for you guys to do some analytic suite or like oh I want to roll out some like you guys talking about the leadership one or leaders uh leaderboard one. Um like stuff like that is crazy cool. Yeah. No, I I uh got me super excited even as you're saying that. I mean, I I uh I'm I'm so beyond excited because like it's um it's uh there should be no reason why why um people can't uh do more if they if they have ideas to to build things. And I mean the the cool part about the W app store is like if you build dashboards for for your business, you can actually then just extend them to every single other business on the platform um and charge people forward or whatever and make a lot more compounding equity value from the creation. So yeah, I'm very excited about the app stuff. Yeah, it's cool. So what made you guys lean into creator just because that was your land already? Um we we so I mean the word creator has kind of kind of cringed I feel like now it's gone from like influencer to creator and we we've always u I mean the way even entrepreneur is like pretty cringe too. I think that's actually one of our biggest struggles. It's like naming this term and how we call uh the people that run businesses like us on our platform. Um so I I uh I think it's all about people you know it's just people some people call themselves a creator people call themselves an influencer maybe not so much anymore. uh some people call themselves streamers, some people call themselves entrepreneur and um our platform is for for people uh to to earn a livelihood and and earn income. So I uh that's always what we've gravitated towards. I think it's just because who we we are and and that's that's who we're very bullish on in the future and and um we're excited about building for entrepreneurs and people that that have their own businesses. So I uh that's how creator came to be and that's the day one we were we were the first uh business owners or or sellers I guess we we should have called them on our platform. Um so that's where it came from. Yeah, makes sense. All right, we're kind of run out of questions. Someone threw chargebacks on here and now I'm going to get selfish again and ask. So like they literally just said chargebacks and I'm curious. So when we used to do more because we sold info and now we sell info and coaching, right? So like I think there was a big distinction there and like the info- coaching is kind of the key word I like to use for this. But when doing info it was a lot of volume and there was a lot of payment plans. It was a lot there was not really recurring for us. It was payment plans but a lot of people do recurring. So in terms of chargebacks like dunning retry whatever all that stuff at the time we use an external service plugged on top of Stripe to do a lot of that portion of it. Do you guys have stuff that like exists within platform currently for payments that does like auto retries that does like reminder email that you can customize that does uh I don't I don't even know honestly because I've never lived in the land of like gray hat or black hat but like people use those like filter things for chargebacks to like warn before and you can refund prior so it doesn't hit like I don't know how any of that works but is that like native to you guys already or in in roadm map? Yeah, it is native. A lot of that is native. Um I think that we have a lot of work to do and and over the next couple months we're going to have a lot of rollouts to things like our dispute fighter that that fights disputes automatically has a lot of customer data as to like hey this person if if this person watched your full course and then opens a dispute it's like come on like that obviously you shouldn't lose that dispute and I think um yes the answer is that a lot of that stuff is native um we have protection in place where if someone's likely going to open a charge back uh we we do uh we can automatically refund it before before it hits the the actual bank and and so on. So yes um that is we view that as a part of our responsibility at chargebacks are a pain in the ass and I mean there's one thing to be said if you're if you're selling a product that is like uh maybe if if you look at if you look at your product and say uh I don't think people are going to charge us back honestly in a mirror then I I think that that's probably right and and uh we we need to do our part in in preventing that. But on on the flip side, if you're if you're selling almost nothing, then I mean you can expect chargebacks and then you can expect the money to be pulled back from from your from your account. So I I uh that that's where we are with chargebacks. Yeah, makes sense. All right, we're out of questions. So now we're just going to jam. So enterprise versus consumer slall business owner. Where do you guys live on that currently? because I've heard, you know, things and again, you can talk about whatever you want or not talk about whatever you want, but like right now the model seems to be how do we get a bunch of these people that are whatever 10k guys, 100k guys, million a month guys, but that's a lot different than someone that's uh 20 million a month or uh whatever. And like there's different exchanges, there's networks, there's like groupings like there's like a lot of those uh what do you call them like almost like aggregator uh cataloges that run a ton of volume but like do it through different specific plat uh or courses inside there. Like do you guys intend to go there and if so would they have to come on platform or like just payments? Yeah, I I take a stab at that. I think we when we started um we were super focused on like the SMB. So super focused on small businesses. It was your traditional person who had $40 a month membership selling access to a Discord. So that's where we started. Then as we scaled um our team we've always been focused on making people as much money as possible. So there's obviously uh we a lot more. It's funny. There's a picture we showed a town hall last week when when we were doing $9 million a month um two years ago at this time, Hunter and I were like assessing the market and we thought that there was $5 million a month in course volume to go. So we were severely we severely underestimated how large this market was. But I think over um middle of last year, end of last year, we started shifting more towards these enterprise businesses as like the core go to market motion of onboarding them because the payment stack we built was just so compelling to Yeah. I think I think maybe sorry just like just to give a quick answer for this. I think it's like if our product works for people that are generating 10K a month, 100K a month, a million dollars a month, then u it means that we we've built a a good product and now it's about chiseling down our onboarding to make it really [ __ ] easy for anybody else to set up. And um over the long run, I mean, we absolutely want to make it so that anybody who who's new to this stuff can go on and and start a business, but um I think that our product's been been somewhat clunky in uh for the newer people. So, so we we've uh we um our goal is to bring it to to consumer and let people start businesses just like that from their phone. Um and uh yeah, so so that that's what we're trying to do. So when you're doing these bit like you said infrastructure layer, you have all the partners that are financing, you have all this. I was on a call the other day and someone was like, "Oh yeah, well like at a certain size you just need to roll up like whatever mainco- finance, have own checking accounts, get these credit lines, just like do this whole thing and essentially self finance and like we are obviously nowhere near the size of you guys in terms of volume and stuff like that." But like does that make sense or do you guys just stay as a tech infrastructure play with partners then because you're obviously extremely enterprise you get like good enough rates that it makes sense for the whatever you call it arbitrage or interchange and all those things or does it make sense at size to literally be your own you know I mean you guys are public about it so like a split it or whatever XYZ uh BNPL like does it make sense to be your own at size and like almost enter like the finance true finance space or just be the tech structure layer or whatever layer on top of Yeah, that's a good it's a good question. I mean, honestly, I think that I think it's u it's like sounds cool in theory to be to be like your own, right? I kind of agree. I think it could sound cool for for some people in theory to to be like really close to to the to the ground level and be your own bank, be your own all this stuff, but the reality is like there's a lot of infrastructure that's already been been built. And I think if we can tap into it and and again maintain the resiliency and maintain the the super low rates, then we don't want to waste our time doing some of those things. So I I think uh like we we want the functionality feature set to be available um and it will be and uh if we have to build our own stuff we're very capable and willing and excited to do that but we also want to be very careful with how we spend our time. So I I think there's definitely a lot of financial um uh products that we will offer. It could be it could be uh I mean yeah like you said financing loans, cards, whatever you can imagine. Um, but uh I think that we're we have our our uh plate kind of full and I think that the when there's more businesses on our platform, it'll make more sense to talk to them and see what they actually need um and uh and build directly for them. So, I mean there's definitely a lot of fintech plans that are tangential to what we're doing and uh would obvious seem like they would work very well and I think we'll get there. Um we're just not super focused on that quite yet. Yeah, I think I like talk about good, bad, ugly just as it is. And again, these are one takes and we and we don't edit them. Uh, but like one of the good, bad, and ugly. I think that is so interesting about what you guys have because you're so close to your like community of customers that you will see people like, for lack of a better word, [ __ ] about something that's wrong and they'll do it on X or they'll do it over here or wherever. And you guys like you have like this army that'll like hit it. like I'll see Stephen, I'll see Cam, I'll see you guys in there, I'll see Hunter, I'll see like other engineers on team that'll respond and be like, "Oh, wait, on this now or like PM for this and like you see these bigger organizations do it and then you see like screenshots of the DMs and it's like never solved." And like I feel like you guys like press forward in that direction like I let's I mean real example, right? like I have a referral or whatever person. I don't optimize for that in the slightest. Have one, had conversations about it. It exists, then it goes away. And like next thing you know, I've got like direct iMessage around this. And like I am a small fish in terms of your guys' world. I don't do anything with [ __ ] FYI. Like at all right now. And like you guys are like in DMs or like chat and like fixing things and like that's pretty interesting. Like I think what your business model what you were just saying is like your connection and user feedback that you guys have and like conversation is pretty like high touch point for Yeah. the size you are at this point. Yeah. I mean it's literally like we we would do we would be nothing without the feedback that we get from users. And I mean honestly it's been one of the more frustrating things that has come with us growing is like it's just it's just harder to talk to to customers and it's harder to know which customers to talk to and it's harder to know to get a representation of all the customers that we really care about. So, I mean, I I think it's like in our DNA to be immediate response times and and uh really try to try to understand the issue at hand. And I mean, sometimes it's it's like sometimes it's really hard to fix the issue that that's at hand immediately. But I at the worst case, we're going to we lose sleep over over these things and and make we'll make sure that like the long-term deep fix is is uh there when we when we redo something or or work on the product in the area that the bug is. Um otherwise, it's fixed immediately. So yeah, it's very very important to us that that's that's the case because I mean the only reason we're doing what we're doing is for all of you. So uh if if if people aren't having a good time or there's something wrong, then we want to fix it ASAP. Yeah, 100%. All right, you're like real time questions coming in is hilarious. Um this is an interesting one and I'm actually curious about this. So opinions on the role of nature versus time in entrepreneurship that doesn't make you a hermit. And I'm going to reframe that to be like you guys said it, you're cracked. You want cracked people on the team. Like that's just is what it is. I kind of sit in the cracked bucket, but like honestly I would say like not even as much as you guys. Like this whole you're young as [ __ ] work life balance, whatever. You just want to build [ __ ] But like how do you view that for yourself? Like do you guys I mean you have fun building obviously, but like do you unplug actually like really ever right now? Do you guys let's get into it? Do you guys do like part Do you know do you do girlfriends? Do you guys do this kind of stuff? Or like is it just not in the [ __ ] cards right now because you're just building? I think it's a good it's a good question. I I mean it's real and like I I get it for what I do and like you guys are like over on this land of like 10 times. I mean I think at the end of the day I mean so I alluded to this earlier but like if if you if you're thinking that your life and work are different that's cool but it's very hard to build something that's uh magical and um and truly like your life's work right. So, so, uh, I think the way I try to approach it is like if I'm not having fun by doing the work that I'm doing, then something's wrong, and I'm going to try to fix that by, uh, making it fun. And when it's fun, it's like, all right, well, I can work all day and have no problem. So, I I I uh I mean, my out my outlets are I play piano. I like to to program a bunch of random [ __ ] inside of our product usually. And I mean, they I uh I find that really fun. Otherwise, I like to eat food and maybe travel sometimes with the team especially is is really fun. Uh, as far as nature, I mean, you can you can work in nature. And I actually probably have a pretty pretty uh good good mind space. So, so I I don't know. I don't really view it as like, oh, I have to go to work now. Like, it's more like, all right, like what am I doing today? I'm not going to not think about work. I'm like either on my phone writing notes, messaging people on Twitter, uh or or using our app or using our platform or or trying to think of ideas or writing on my computer and uh using our product, talking to customers and and programming, whatever whatever I can do. I just find that really fun. Um so yeah, that that's my answer. I don't know if Cam, I need it. I need to hear it. Yeah. No, I think for me, like I'm just like so addicted to this [ __ ] Like when I go to bed, I'm like I [ __ ] cannot wait to wake up to work on this stuff. And I think I I follow probably more of like a rigid routine that Steve does. I try to wake up um early in the morning and like work out every single day. But then from that point forward, it's like it's so fulfilling. Like I love I I love playing video games growing up and like building these simulations. And this is like the ultimate game. It's like so large. There's so many different stakeholders. So um to me everything like there there's two things. One, if I'm not working, I'm freaking out because I'm worried about other companies that are working while I'm not working. I'm like, [ __ ] Like every minute matters. Um, and I just get so much joy out of building with our team and the stuff we're doing right now. And I feel like especially now we're all super focused. So I like I mean it's for me it's like pretty much like seven days a week. I don't have a girlfriend or anything right now. Like it's just pure like love of the like I just love I'm so addicted to this [ __ ] Like when I'm I just love the I love this [ __ ] so much. It's like it's I don't to Stephen's point like I don't wake up and I'm like I have to go to work now. I wake up and I'm like, I cannot wait to get there and start like get on my computer and start going. Yeah, dude. That's the I feel like that's the fun of like when there's actually like constant growth. My whole thing is like I've kind of identified as like problem solving. I like problem solving. Anytime it becomes like maintenance or recurring, I literally hate my life. Like when I have to do the same thing over and over again, not my speed. And then kind of like true goals are not really like an kind of a number on a screen. Cool. But it's more so about like the progression of like the skill set and the person and like now we're solving new problems. So it's like those stacked on top of each other. As you solve a new problem, it like grows you as an individual, personal, business, you know, they're all one and the same. And like that's the track right now, but like you guys are doing it at a completely different scale and level over here with like it's just badass. So like yeah. No, I mean kudos. Kudos. And I walk into your office and it literally is like a video game. It literally is like a video game. It's like this the build your own adventure. So that's all we got for main questions on here. You guys want to jam on anything specific? I know I told you uh you know we went an hour before this so we're probably out of pocket on time on time for you guys but like anything else you guys want a specific jam on? No, I mean honestly really really appreciate you having us and and um I've really enjoyed this conversation. I love what you do and and keep killing it. I'm excited to stay in touch and and stay close and uh I mean I don't know. I I don't have anything else. It's really fun. You're a legend. The the 116 days in a row. I've always thought about just like filming [ __ ] but it's cool that you've built the system. you're building a massive business and also have the time to just like and I've been watching your video it's just so raw. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you guys right now my my personal relationships are faltering due to this. But uh you know doing it I'm going to go to two to three a week and then keep the cadence now that the momentum's built. But cool guys. Yeah. No, we'll definitely have to figure out a way that we do something together and we can go offline for that. But there's definitely something here. I love working with you guys. It's fun. I think it's cool. Um so yeah. So cool guys. Cool. All right. Well, appreciate you being on. Uh, I will now. I did my shameless shill. I did my shameless shill, guys. Don't give me [ __ ] in the chat, but comment below what you guys if you're still here. I like this one. If you're still here, comment 50. So, I will talk to you guys soon and I'lling see you tomorrow. So, peace.
