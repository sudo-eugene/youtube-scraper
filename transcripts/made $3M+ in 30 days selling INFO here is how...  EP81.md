# made $3M+ in 30 days selling INFO here is how... | EP81

What's up, guys? In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we made $3,40,780 last month in total cash collected in our info coaching business. Here's a Stripe screenshot to verify. This is for the month of May, and today is June 1st, and I just took this screenshot 3 minutes ago. I'm going to break down marketing, sales, fulfillment, and tech departments. We're going to talk about what worked, what did not work, things we changed, and then I'm going to break down the marketing systems and funnels we use to acquire these customers. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in this in this business and we've now crossed over 75 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. No mentorship, no courses, consulting, nothing. All I'm doing is sharing what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company opportunities and network with cool people doing cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. So just took the screenshot for you guys. We're going to bounce around a little bit here, but let's start with sales. So sales was the biggest change up and as you can see you can go back on the channel and I shared last month's where we did 1.62. Um but the biggest change for us that happened month overmonth was sales. So we got a new cso. Um I actually used this system from people I met in uh YouTube and X to find a chief of sales and he came in and very strong personality, very strong um changes that he made and put in place. But the energy overall shifted. So we had I think one or two sales reps that ended up leaving um during that time and kept the same team, the same lead flow, the same everything from marketing, same volume and we produced 87% more and they actually started around this range right here. Uh which is just crazy. So with that he changed script. So we were not super strong held on the scripting that was happening or what was being used there. So uh more it was just I don't want to say softer is maybe the wrong word but it was kind of a more lax situation prior and now we're coming in and being more numbers driven script uh script driven and focused around these specific things and also rolled out a deck that we use. So going through all of those, the real big changes were the overall energy, the expectations, the scripting, how we're doing the actual pitch, uh how the cadence of the meetings is happening, how the onetoone cadence is happening, just like the overall management of that department. Um there are going to be es and flows with that. There are going to be personality issues, there's going to be communication differences and issues, uh there's going to be expectation issues. So we are still navigating this. Um just to be very transparent with like how, you know, hard or soft or where we want to live in this in terms of culture and how this fits. Um because everyone on the team is great and is important to us. It just depends on you know where they fit with how high performance the culture gets. Um and that's everywhere. That's across every department. That's across every um chunk or department of the company uh across leadership and across you know boots on the ground. So yeah this was a really big change for us. I'm happy to go into more into this if you guys want to drop some comments or questions. Um but all this is pretty I don't say standard but it just became the expectation that didn't exist before which is pretty crazy for us. So close rate big increase uh cash collected in revenue per call big increase all of that just from the sales portion. So getting into the fun uh getting into the fulfillment and then we're going to go tech and go marketing at the end because that's usually your guys' favorite where I'll then share the funnels. But for us uh up until last Monday, the only thing we sold was one hero product. So we sell annual coaching. Um and right now we actually only have a little bit of info we sell. It's a majority coaching where it's a onetoone uh annual agreement for coaching. So, it's onetoone with a coach. Um, I like to view the models as, you know, down from info, coaching with you, group with you, uh, coaching one-on-one with a coach, coaching group with a coach. And we lived in this one with a coach. Okay. So, only backend we had was more of the same. So, they could just purchase another year or continue on their membership. And we just rolled out group um, I'm sorry, yes, actually group for the back end. So we now have two different offerings where they can either basically downell on a continuity where they stay in a group coaching capacity or they can do multi-year of that and like there's these different options for the back end. So we have a retention team in place. There's a lot of evolution that's going to come from this. I'll make probably complete dedicated videos on this uh in the future of how we optimize this because it's nowhere near optimized. We just launched it. Um but this was new to us. So we launched that portion comp changes uh to the overall team where we better align them. Um you know we're kind of doing this all from the hip and trying to learn as we go. Um but against industry comps, you know, trying to be in those right ranges, um trying to make it efficient for them so they can take XYZ clients across the coach load. Um but what we finally came out with was something that was really good with like tenure with uh tenure um pay with things that have comp uh competitions and contests internal and then made it easier in terms of like admin as well for how they get bonused across based on client load with an expectation of X base with X clients and then can climb, you know, based on as they get more. uh we had the tiers probably too far apart on this first iteration of it. So it was harder to reach these other ones or it was more inconsistent if they had clients leave or newcome or if the lead flow was slow. So this was a big change that we made um that I think is really beneficial to everyone to the company for cleanliness and like admin side as well as for the team to know you know where they sit in comp. Client wins channel is exploding which is amazing to see. That's like the lifeblood of this entire company. So, spinning back around all the way over to marketing and how they use these then for uh marketing assets, uh website assets, all that stuff. Um, and then just overall, right, it's like reviews fly in the it's just it's the lifeblood when you see that, you know, your thing actually gets results, that your that your uh program or your company actually gets good results. So, this was a really big win for us. Um, there's a ton in the channel that are now used also across these. And the one thing I'm not saying here is how I'm sitting right now is basically like over these. So I have like a direct lead of all of these that I'm working with and I'm trying to grow in the skill set to be basically operating those different leads and not necessarily be in the weeds of all of them but understanding what's happening and then you know basically operating through project managing through data. So this is another huge one. We have had very inconsistent and messy data when it comes to fulfillment. Basically everything that happens after marketing and sales. I've owned this process forever. Um and I have extremely good data in marketing and sales but once it hits fulfillment it just sits in fulfillment. It's the same reason we probably didn't have a back end is like the tracking of that, the activation points, the when is someone good to talk to about a renewal. We didn't even have something to offer them for a renewal. So, there was a lot of stuff around this that just wasn't there. So, we ended up partnering up um or more so paying this company um to come in and is going to restructure all the data, how we do things with automations, flow, and data storage. Uh right now, we're in HubSpot and like nine Google Sheets basically, and we're moving all of that to a centralized place to have like a source of truth. Um which then rolls right over into into tech because it's the same thing. So tech is owning this and the tech leads and stuff are owning this portion with fulfillment and then it immediately bleeds over into sales and marketing. Uh marketing not as much and I'm going to get to that next. Um but sales for sure because of cash collection, because of invoicing, um because of renewals, which are also acting as a sales function, all those things tying together. So it's going to be a huge overhaul of how we do all things data. And I'm sure I'll make a complete dedicated video on this of like how we land. Um, but whether we fully go into HubSpot with all our data, whe whether we use this likely data lake, uh, external system and then connect back into, uh, it's going to be super super good. So, uh, I'm very excited for that. I don't know the exact timeline of it, but this team is like fully leading it and then getting all the context from here. And then eventually we'll have to pull all the stuff from sales for, um, because that's how we currently track everything for commissions and, uh, renewals and refunds and what's new versus active and all that stuff exists over here. And that needs to all be centralized into these. So, I'm pretty excited for that one. marketing tech is brand new actually so it's not even really in effect for this last month um but just hired someone finally this is a position that I do that I have always clicked the keys I build the funnels um even if we have a designer do some stuff I do all the data connections the custom fields the storage the reporting all that um so finally hired someone who is a pro in this from XYZ past company and is coming over with a ton of experience in our exact tech stack which is going to be very exciting for us uh and mainly for me because uh I call it clicking of the keys but like 80% of my clicking of the keys work is still that or probably more and if I can get out of that then I have more time and space to really you know problem solve and identify and strategize on how we can take some of these departments and and think ahead and just be more proactive versus oh hey can we connect this new funnel or do this new split test and like I'm still in the weeds doing that so this will be a big help for us cost savings we did a big approach we changed up a lot of things we do with our chart of accounts and in the P&L so that we could identify things that fall into XYZ bucket and we are moving things in the direction of cost savings for software for licenses for users as well as automation ations. We've had a very very heavy Zapier setup and all that kind of stuff. Sorry if this is boring, but this is this is life. Um, but we've had a lot of that. So, we're moving things over to NAND and some of these other automation softwares for some of the higher volume ones that don't require as many steps um and can just be executions. So, that's a huge one. So, tens of thousands of savings um potentially on a monthly basis. We're already close to 10 uh in savings a month, which is amazing. And then project systems. So, I want to talk about this one as kind of what I was saying is overarching. um I built a master operations thing. So we used to basically all meet us plus some other people within these departments as this one master operations meeting and we've now transitioned and shifted that to being one master board. We have only some key people here and then in one meeting where it's like cross sync and then we have division specific meetings. So we meet specific around tech, specific around fulfillment, specific uh around people, specific around sales and specific around marketing. Uh and then they have their meetings within their cadence. So we're trying to get to a point where it's a little more I don't get corporate is maybe the wrong word but structured and how we do that and with that comes structured project systems and data. So what data exists for them? What's reported? What is in the meetings? What is on the agendas? Uh and then how is the project flow. So we built this masterboard. We use ClickUp. I've heard people use Asana and Air Table. I actually really like Air Table because it's a little more technical uh in my opinion. But we're on ClickUp. So uh in there we have this master list and things are segmented down by their department and then also based on like what's cross sync versus department which touches other ones of these and then how do they have sublists we've moved all of the individual teams from the people who live in let's call it sales for example like sales ops setter ops uh management um that's something else I didn't talk about in sales the setting divi the setting division has been a big help for this they do now do um call uh confirmations for the marketing bookings they do uh auto sets from the low ticket stuff which I'll get into all those here We're going to actually talk about that more. And then they also do um so self sets, confirmed sets, and auto sets. Uh and they're crushing. They're hitting really, really good numbers. And you know, everyone who talks to them has a much higher show rate and a much higher close rate. Uh it's just getting them the tech and tools and system to make sure that they can hit the most amount of people in the most efficient way possible, which is a big push into next month. Um but back to the project systems. So yeah, so we basically centralized all this into one. So people can see the other departments, they can see cross sync, they can see who is, you know, assigned. We're on a big like one person is the champion of this. There may be multiple people that need to touch it for it to get over the finish line. Um, but one person is in charge of when this is due. So things essentially sit in, you know, the worst word ever phrase ever in in online, but like the parking lot, they sit in an idea bank and then they move to to-do and as soon as they go into to-do, they get a due date and they get one champion and that is like hard. So we're using the due dates as the priority and then cycles through there and then they move into in progress and then completed or blocked depending. Um, so yeah, that's been a really big kick for us. The big change here, if I'm boring you guys, I'm sorry, but this is again life. Uh, was the big change in the sales and then what everything that happened with marketing prior. So, if you watch through these videos, this is the day 81 I believe in a row of doing these. We were bleeding out, right? Like there was we were breaking even, bleeding out, not good. And we needed to fix marketing, we fixed marketing, and then sales was not backing out. And we were like, "Oh, it's still marketing problem." But really what it was is very clearly a sales thing. Um because as soon as we changed some of the sales leadership, some of the energy, got some at bats for some of the newer reps and just in general. Um all the changes that happened here, we went from call it 70 to 70k day. I mean I guess what is it? 80k if it was 1.6. Um to that math doesn't math whatever you know what I mean. Uh it was that 40k day. 48 12. No, I'm blanking so hard. No, it's like five six. Yeah, six. Um so of those never do public math. That's for my first million. But we jumped tound and something consistent days just from that. So that change with what was already existent in marketing is crazy. So now we're like really really doubling down on marketing so that this can continue and then we just need to scale this linear and then make sure that this continues to drive cost down and quality up which is like a dance right so CMO still in place crushing it. He is he's brought so much good to the company. We're now growing the team, which I'll talk about down here, but he is just like he can be boots on the ground and like in the weeds and he can also zoom out and see the overarching things. So, he's just crushing it for us and consistently filling the calendars for these sales reps with quality people uh at good economics like the costs are in alignment. Um, so let's break down the funnels real quick. So, this is a chart I've used a lot of times. I'm just going to talk about what some of the updates are. So, we run essentially three core funnels, right? So, you're going to see the different colors here. So, the first one is going to be our VSSL opt-in funnel. It's how we did 71 million of our total thing before we rolled out any of these other ones. Um, and still is actually a majority. But so they come in, they opt in. We only do name and email. We do not do phone number just because we don't use AI tools or set or setters or anything to where the justification for the decrease in optins you get when you ask for phone number. Um, they then watch VSSLs. Then when they watch the VSSL, it is uh cookied to where um the timer comes up at the CTA, which is 80% of the way through, but you have their email so you can remarket to them. They then apply. they get routed whether on the quality of that. Um, some people do income, some people do all these other things. We use one that's like based on how much they've invested in themselves in the past because it's just like our market. Um, they land on a specific booking thing. They either book with this one or this one. Everything looks the same for them. They get on a sales call and they close. DTA, this one we have running kind of small, but we're testing a bunch of different things on this, but this is what most people I've seen an info coaching run. So, this is going to be your headline, VSSL, and then application button. Some people run it so it's delayed for 5 minutes. Some people let it show immediately. Um, but you just got to kind of play that game. And this one for us, uh, is actively running. We tested three different. We found one winner or it's like still it's it's good, but it's not like fantastic. So, this is just kind of in the pause range. And then this is our other like big one that we're optimizing. Um, so we have a low ticket funnel that is built for ascension. So, what some what's going to happen is someone's going to see an ad, they're going to come to a landing page. It's a long form sales page. You can look at like Alen Sultanic and those guys. They talk a lot about this on economics and they crush it. Um, and it's a long form sales page where they then go to purchase and they put in their name, email, and click next. Brings them to a checkout. So, you get that opt-in, but they're like in the process of checking out. So, like kind of a two-step. They'll check out here and then we get, you know, 50% call it, let's say that then fill this out. So, you have your drop off rate. And then the big thing here is instead of then having Otto's where it's more cash, you're trying to like offset and get into profit with what we're trying to do is just liquidate here and then push them into booking a call. So they book a call on the thank you page that's framed as like a quick start call and they will talk to a setter. Once they talk to a setter, they will then get pushed over which is right here actually. Right? Then they will get pushed to set to talk to a closer and then close. So there's obviously massive drop off. So you know let's say 90% drop off here, 50% drop off here, 40% 50% drop off here, 40% drop off here, right? And like you get down this, but the economics on it still are insane. So, it's all about what you can get your net CPA to. So, let's say you can get it to $100, right? So, it cost you $150 to sell a product that's 50 bucks. So, the net is h 100red and then whatever percent of these people back out into closes over here. You could just do your division. So, let's say it's $100 and you get 6%. That's a $1,600 CPA um on your backend product and all of this and the amount of volume you have through here. And it's the time, too. So, I can go into these like really in depth. Um, but yeah, we're changing a lot of things on this to make it more cold friendly because ours currently acts as more of a retargeting asset because we have so many people in the pipeline for years of doing this. Um, it doesn't necessarily crack cold at the same rate. We're testing things like order bumps to increase the AOV on this but not add things on the back end because we don't want to uh because we're trying to focus on the ascension rate and the time from low ticket to high ticket uh which is this portion right here. Um, but what you can do is increase prices. You can uh add order bumps. You can have multi-point checkout. You can do like all these different little things in here um that we're optimizing around right now. So that's the general on the funnel. Um the other piece which I think I have on here next. No. So new hires. So we have crazy new hires coming on. So we're building a bunch of stuff out in this team. I'm trying to re in costs so we don't get to a point where we're just raise opex and you know stay at the same thing. Um but we're basically hired out to 5 billion plus a month for sure. Um other than some of these like linear ones like uh coaches for example or sales uh reps. Um, but like the actual overhead style team or like department over here, tech doesn't need to get bigger. Uh, marketing doesn't need to get bigger. Uh, HR doesn't need to get bigger. CS shouldn't really need to get bigger until a little bit later and then it's like one or two. Um, but these can be like, you know, 510 increases. Um, so in that new hires that are coming, we have V uh editors that are coming online. Um, we had a like acquisition style copywriter that came on. So we had an graphic designer that came on. So just some really core cool hires that are also have worked in industry with the same that our CMO has. So like they have a lot of overlap which is fantastic because they have good working culture already um because they already had it in the past. So that was a big one. Brand faces. This was big. So this VSSL funnel we're actually technically running two right now with brand face one. Um that is is what I'm going to say brandace one and that's like co-founder. That's one we've done everything on so far and we have two other brand faces that we're testing. We use them in ads currently um because the goal is to get out of founder risk and like if we ever do sell or whatever I understand it's a pipe dream 99.999% never sell um but 99.99 probably never try. So we may try but in doing that you need to make sure that you have diversification on the front end um that there's no founder risk or you know specific point risk. So having multiple brand faces that are in the demo of who we sell to is something we are moving towards. We use them in ads right now and they work really well but they are working to a funnel that is then someone else. So call it branded 2 ad goes to Brandface one VSSL and that's just like not congruent. So we now have VSSLs that are being built that are going to be for those as well. So we'll have one, two, three, four of those. We likely will then test them on DTA and we likely will then build out low tickets for them. So you could say we could have upwards of six to nine of these. And with one VSSL funnel we did 70 whatever million. So if we do this right and we optimize these correctly and we don't get you know shiny object and we move from one to the next to the next and make sure that you know when you leave the other one it's at the scale it needs to be or can get and we're not just doing it to do it. Um, I think we're going to be in a really healthy place with marketing that then it'll just all land into sales and how much sales can do. And then if sales is the breakpoint and whatever culture people things, uh, close percent, whatever it is, if they crush that, then it lands into fulfillment, making sure that that's good. And we're trying to get ahead of that proactively with the data, the systems, um, aligning comps, making sure that, you know, client wins are in place and the feedback loops there and trying to think ahead for that solve. And then last piece is an organic engine. So almost I mean 99% of our first click comes from these through paid ads. So we spend pretty heavily um on paid advertising in order to achieve these results and we have a ton of organic stuff. We have you know thousands of hours of videos to probably tens of thousands of hours of videos and just we've never really cracked it to where organic is our first click and that is something that the more I venture into YouTube and X and all the stuff I see. So we're going to make a concerted effort to push in that direction to start to build out an organic engine so that we can because right now all of it acts basically as middle and bottom of funnel and the target is for it to be first click right and to actually generate cold audience uh which would be amazing um because as we all know organic is really helps the P&L obviously but also it's just you know they're higher quality they show to calls better they close on calls better they just have more consumption they're warmer they're not doing it sitting on their couch at 9:00 p.m. because they saw an ad for 12 seconds, right? Like the consumption is huge. Um the trust is huge that exists. So if we can build that out, that would be fantastic. And then yeah, just so much more to come. So like I said, there's always people problems. There's always things that are going to happen. There's there's a lot of problems, right? It's like it's just what kind or what level. So there's, you know, people problems, there's uh data problems, there's all these things that we're trying to navigate. Um funnel things broke like crazy. But yeah, overall it was a it was a good second half of the month leaning in and I'm excited for what we're going to do into this month. I'm not going to project really out because we might have some shifts in what we do volume-wise or across this, but like we're in the right direction. So, I'm very excited about that. Um, and yeah, I'll be able to update you guys into next month. Today was day 80 of doing these videos. I'm doing interviews with a bunch of cool people that I've met in the space that are in um online marketing in general. So, lead genen, paper call, uh, info coaching, SAS, all the things, e physically, ecom. So, I've been doing a lot of those videos as well as some of these training style videos are just sharing what's working for us or what has exploded for us. Um, you can see them all here, www.rroncl.comdoc. I sort them by tech, marketing, sales, ops, fulfillment, or actually maybe not fulfillment, mindset. Um, but you can see them here. And then, yeah, hit me on IG or X if you guys have any questions. I love when you guys comment below these. It feeds the elgo and also gives me some perspective on what's helpful or not. Today was probably a little more boring I would feel for you guys um based on just kind of how I was sharing and what it was. But this is this is it. It's more the same at a certain point. It's restructuring. It's building. It's finding proactive things that will break or reactively fixing things that are on fire or broke. So, we're trying to do, you know, dance the game. Always solve the thing that's right there. And what's the one big thing? What's the current bottleneck? Right now, we would say it's probably sales. Next, it'll very likely be fulfillment and tech and data. So, we're trying to solve for that ahead of time. Um, but yeah, then it'll probably be marketing again. So, it's always something. Um, but I'm excited for where we're going. So, appreciate you guys and uh I'll talk to you soon.
