# The Email & SMS Automations Behind a $70M Call Funnel (Steal This) | E3
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ8X2TxqmSs

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the vssl call funnel contextual automations that we use to do 70 million in one funnel all right um so contextual meaning the communication automation so none of the tech and pushing zaps data from here to here is just going to be where we do communication so email SMS calling um stuff like that later videos I can have the other stuff um and as always the videos here are basically just me showing what has worked for us what has not worked and we've changed um and this exact sequence and evolution to this sequence is how we did 70 million just through one funnel and one setup so first things first I have other videos on the channel where I go through the actual pages of these so I'm going to quick do that uh as I talk about these but you can see that on the channel um so first things first someone's going to opt in when they come to the optin page we're just going to collect their name and email so we have tried with phone number in the past um but for us it didn't make sense because we weren't hitting the leads on time we didn't have proper Setters AI wasn't where it was when we tested it last um to be able to have uh basically get more value out of less leads cuz it was whatever it was 25 30% drop um to get more value out of the emails with phone then just emails at a higher volume okay so still to this day we only do name and email so first things first they're going to get an email that says here's your training you know basically click back here to go this is what you opted in for here's it via email okay then after around 25 minutes which is how long the vssl is right here ish in the video oh they are going to have a uh cookie timer like popup CTA here and at that same time um based on which video they're on they're going to get an email that is going to give them bonuses okay so in the beginning of the vssl we use and for all the Frameworks we've used thus far it's basically says if you save the end I'm going to give you XYZ bonus okay everyone gets this email no matter if they actually stay at that length or not so it's just hardcoded in there to send at 25 or whatever the CTA timing of the video is 25 27 minutes whatever um and it sends them bonuses via email okay the page they go to for this is this and this is important because instead of just sending them the email that says here's your bonus and they click on it we send them to this page and because we offer I believe four different bonuses at this time they will go to this page and it's Force consumption so over 80% of our traffic is on mobile so again I made a video on this I have to make this prettier my my Dev is doing it now but um so they have to do consumption through this so they go oh cool I'm going to claim my bonuses via email so they go to their email for it you get higher open rates pass it back higher email sender reputation all that stuff because they're opening and clicking on these emails the first ones they're going to go and have to consume through this to get to the bonuses at the bottom they have to look at testimonials okay whole time then bonuses are below so here's one two three four bonuses that they can claim right so that email is huge that one gets Great Click rates um and then once they go into these each one of these is own dedicated place they can claim it so they don't just get everything it has more micro commitments as they go they have to go to the page to find it they have to click through here they have to give give the information so we know who claimed which ones not just blanket give the offer to everyone because then you can't track which one uh you know let's say you have thousand leads come through and 400 of them are in one bucket and then it's like 200 200 whatever right breakout so you'll know that that one is clearly more your buyer demo or how you're running ads right now they're more interested in macronutrients versus menopause versus whatever right and then you can see from which ones get this which ones apply book a call buy right so which is important that you have those tracking of those commitments throughout going off pays a little bit but they get this email here then from there they are in a flow that is contextual all we call this push to app so this one we're going to call push to app this one push to book and this one booking confirmed right they're kind of like the three main buckets in here now they're basically just going to get value ads so the whole beauty of why we set up our website the way we did was so that when people go to the site they're just constantly consuming so we will then send just value every day that is you know truth about sugar cravings for 40 so they'll see this and generally we actually send them to the watch Pages because that seems to convert better so this will be in an email that's right after a day later they'll see this and then they'll consume more content and the CTA everywhere is apply now which is the next step right because they're in the opin The Next Step In The Funnel is for them to apply so this pushes them to there just through content and through consumption because again you have someone who's on ad and then by the time they get on the phone you're trying to sell them something that's 5 10 20K whatever they need need to have consumption not just see an ad and then get on the phone to buy like there just doesn't make sense that way so everything we do is Value First in this way with of course called actions to apply but very value first and then on top of that everybody in the this list and then anybody who's on like a 90day I believe it's 90 right now 90day click and 60-day open I believe is what we're running maybe 30-day open is in a big list that gets twice a day campaigns they are the exact same thing that are value value pushing them to the website consume content consume content and then the the site itself does the ctas to push them to app so one step at a time um and then yeah so these are really important and same thing when we drop new YouTube videos the new YouTube video goes live on the page goes onto the website once it's on the website goes over the copywriting team and then uh the copywriters send this out in or like email manager um sends these out so that then you get the instant uh views you get to grow that in that way and it's always fresh content and then they will recycle as top performers but twice a day emails every day and right now the list is like 100 something that fit in that criteria that we sent out so this is like bread and butter and not can have other videos where I go through like kpis and stats of this um but quick numbers let's say you have a thousand opt-ins on that you'll get 250 apps maybe that's rough numbers kind of depends sometimes it can be low and it can be like 13 but it varies but so just in terms of the communication uh flows then someone applies all right so when someone applies they fill out here and they will collect we collect what 17 questions and that includes name email and phone number is the first time we get phone number for them so now this opens up that we can call them and we can text them right these have direct opt-ins consent and all that kind of stuff for compliance and throughout this we are gathering what they currently are where they currently are sitting what they can't do what they tried to do all those things and Gathering all this information across this and this is important for the next part so first thing this is actually above the app we have it so if someone lands on the application page but does not do it we track them in HubSpot with the page view and then we wait x amount of time and if they haven't submitted an app we push back almost like an abandoned cart you do an Ecom that's like oh I saw you tried to apply but you didn't like what's stopping you style and much better copyrighting I'm not a copywriter by any means um team is 10 times better me than that but this is the fun one that we just rolled out within the last month or so that's starting to pick up some steam and get uh it gets really high rates um and then obviously getting applications and bookings which then turns so but the app not booked contextual content and email so this one now is going to them that is just more contextual for uh instead the ctas if there are any if it's not just value first then they will say book a call right so the first couple are very hot against that that's like hey you applied you didn't book a call hey you applied you didn't book a call and then the rest are basically just like more intentful content that's still with the CTA though book a call okay then this is the fun one so we have never had Setters we've tried it oh not never because we've tried it and we didn't have the right people in place we didn't have the right management in place systems whatever you want to call it it just did not work for us so to date everything that we've done for this call funnel is literally app booking straight to closer so no Setters no CRM nurture we have however however many a million and some change contacts in HubSpot um and we don't call outbound we don't nurture we don't like if someone falls off they fall off so like in current state we'll sell 1% of our leads for every 100 optins we get one unit so there's 99 people that land in you know what's called 30 of them apply 15 of them book a call like is in that range and all the other and even those they don't buy 1% buy and we have nothing else to sell them so I'm excited to do these videos because I'll be able to look back on this and be like oh I can't believe we did that and you know thankfully we got it to work to the scale we did but now Setters now Load Ticket all these different pieces because we could sell another 30% of those leads on Load Ticket we could have Setters and double from one to or triple from 1 to 3% if we just nurtured better so okay side tag in but true so Mandy AI SMS so we actually have a uh AI agent that we custom built so we initially used a software not on name names but we used one that was out of the box that basically grabs somebody who applies Waits 7 minutes and if they don't book starts a text communication AI chat okay and all text based because calling still in March of 2025 does not work with AI in a clean way that doesn't sound like Ai and can navigate properly so through SMS it is now going to send them so we built a custom one in-house for hundreds of dollars not tens of thousands to run it um or high thousands to run it so basically what this will do is it'll ingest all of their application information it knows already everything about us and how messaging has worked and trained based on what has converted in the past has all that and then takes the person's contextual application information that they've tried keto they've tried Jenny CRA they've done XYZ their goal is to not be this they think they're skinny fat um they want this they're this age bracket they this income like these different things in this and it feeds that all in so that then it can have a conversation with them and be like hey I saw you did this but not this and try to push and I can go through messaging on that later um on the specifics of it but essentially it is navigating back and forth conversation has reminders in place to hey like where'd you go send the gifts do the whole thing um and that right now collects 11% or so of our bookings in a week so if we get a th000 bookings 110 or so had conversations with Mandy which is our AI agent and then ended up booking a call in current state all we do with them is uh direct push them to a link to book that's then tracked we have we're testing a little bit with having um Dynamic back and forth where it can like look at a calendar say oh are you available at this time they can say yes and it can create the auto booking but just because of the tracking stuff in the back end it's a little harder so we keeping it simple right now and then the other thing it does um and I didn't even build this which is amazing someone on our team our senior Tech leader is a badass and he built this out but we then have like a database that has all of the resources on the site so it can say okay this woman is interested in this this this and this it can find then the link from something on the site and push them a Content piece that says oh I think you'd like this oh I think this video this read page this uh podcast would be interesting to you based on your application okay so just more personalization customization that you could easily do a Setters but because we didn't have at the time and this runs 247 and right so this is really cool and just further development like this week we're what day is it Saturday today or tomorrow we're going to be live at Blue so we're going to try uh one of the blue sending platforms to make it so it looks like or it can communicate like iMessage because a large majority of ours are iMessage as well so instead of sending green bubbles supposedly you get 20% uh I'm sorry 2x 200% um which I gu said 100% but you get uh 2x the response rates which is crazy because that could just directly double and we could get another 150 bookings a week we can get another 20 a day potentially so that'd be cool based on what we've seen so all we all we're doing there is changing the conduit so instead of having the content delivered through green the same exact AI content is delivered through blue so going to test that out this week and I will report back and then the booking one my absolute least favorite and the one that just like irks my soul um oh actually another one that comes in here is we then push the freebies so we push push out individual emails for the uh free products that they get if they St at the end of the vsl they already have them likely but each one is in a dedicated email just to like because they're almost across the Finish Line it's like here consume more content here take this free thing here's more value so we do that in there as well forgot and that's via email um all right so the booking we have wrestled with this non-stop non-stop non-stop so again because we do not use Setters the pain here is show rates so for the longest time it was literally just like the calendly booking whatever automated things branded email from HubSpot and then get on the calendar and we had 40 50 60% show rates call it in there they would tank down they'd be 40 because we'd break something like it was just a nightmare so as of recent with the what I'm about to share is we're at like 55% show rates we just changed something and like for last week it's been like 45% and because we don't have Setters or any of these things doing calls it's literally just add basically straight to booking obviously there's consumption you have the really quality people that come through but a majority is not so 55 to 60 is like the best we've ever had for a sustained amount of time we've been in 70s and stuff but just like never sustained because based on the traffic quality and it scale um but this is what we currently have set up that were fingers crossed we were homing at around 55% and hopefully we can go 55 60% and then we're going to roll in Setters and hopefully go like 70 so first things first is they get a calendar invite we use cly still to this day so round robin and kly they get a calendar invite inv that you know basically approve this approve this they have gone through this page to do so and they can only book in a 48 hour window okay so this out to 48 hours so if it's 12 right now they can only book until 12 two days from now all right all we collect is this then in here it's going to say if there's no suitable times available for you go to here and we have a custom booking time request so we took this from somebody we funnel hacked somebody and took this but this is brilliant and these pop into a sales hot leads channel that sits in there and like basically um allows someone to be like oh I can do in three days or oh can you reach out to me in a week or something like that so it lets you m grab opportunities that you may have missed and then same thing sometimes kly bugs out and this just goes here um I don't know we sold this from someone too but so they go here then they're going to land on this page okay this is post booking and what we tell them so get ready we're going to text you whatever we're going to call you from a 610 number which is the area code that we use for the phone numbers we call from and then it's going to be on on a zoom uh make sure you're on a computer watch this video preframe video look at these testimonials and then watch these reviews all right so going back to this first thing they're going to get is a calendar invite and land on that page right then an email is going to come from the sales rep dynamically that it was assigned to through cley so from HubSpot it's going to send them an email that's going to say Hey you know basically like scarcity is like qualification hey there was 2,000 applications you're somebody who qualified congratulations but here's what you need to do before the call first things first like go to this page watch these videos consume this like do this and we're pointing them all back to that page I just showed you the scheduled success page so in there um we just constantly optimize and push towards there then the next one is a call confirmation so the second someone books they go into a opportunities Channel and we have a 20 I think it's 20 hours right now 27 so 7 days a week 20 hours a day a call confirmation team that a second someone books into there they claim it they pop in HubSpot they dial the person and then if they don't answer they double dial and if they don't answer they leave a voicemail and an SMS and basically it's like hi I'm Rebecca from or hi you know Ryan I'm Rebecca from the warrior bab call confirmation team uh your booking is almost complete we just do this step here where we need to confirm and get like a verbal yes from you to say that yes you did mean uh to book for 5:30 Central Time right Central um and and you know it's Zoom call so like basically confirming time zone and then confirming that it's a zoom call not a phone call CU our Target demo is like 40 to 60 so sometimes there's a gap there and same thing with time zone that's just difficult sometimes for people especially if they're moving around so we confirm that there in current state we get 60% of our bookings that are claimed and that actually are like are claimed in a way that they say yes those people that then claim with someone have like a 70 something like 72% show rate versus not that have like 4050 so that's where our blank Ed 55 comes from is because it comes through um comes comes through the call confirmation Team all right so that's there and then I'll zip through these ones but because I'm going I didn't realize I was going so long um the sales rep 30 minute post so this is another AI infused message so it basically uses the Mandy Tech takes their application takes their info and says hi this is Ryan from The Warrior bab team I see you booked in with me tomorrow at 11:30 and uh based on what you saw like here's a resource that I thought might be helpful for you that I think you should watch before our call like talk soon okay so that comes out 30 minutes right after they book so it's like an initial touch point with the sales repe the entire time we send branded nurture emails leading up to their calls uh we did have this every two hours we got a couple people complaining that it was like frustrating to them that we kept emailing them so we changed it to four hours and then the last three on here is then uh 3 hours before simple couple bullet sales rep uh email that says hey be prepared for the call by doing this make sure you're in a quiet Place make sure that you have whatever you're ready for the call and all this then right before that 1 hour before an SMS from the sales rep that says hey so and so our calls in one hour here's your link simple and then I'm sorry that is the 30 minute before and then the one hour before automated comes from cly just says like another catch all and that's just cly this is an automated reminder no reply don't do it but your call is here and here's the link for it so that is the general gist I feel like I might be missing something here but it's pretty close too um so yeah let me know if you have any questions and again all I'm trying to do here is just share what we're doing what's worked for us and then be able to look back at these and be like oh it's hilarious that's how we ran this so thank you guys and talk soon
