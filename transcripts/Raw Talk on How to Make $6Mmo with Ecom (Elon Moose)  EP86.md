## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpQEKbhNW-M

What's up, guys? In today's video, we've got ecom legend Met on X Elon Moose. That's a fun. How we doing? What's up? Let's get it, bro. Let's get it. We are What's the business right now? Or what's the what's the model you're running? Yep. So, we run a e-commerce holding company. I have uh three other co-founders in the model. So, we run currently two main brands. Um I can give you the short version or the long version of the story of how I got here. Yeah. Yeah, we got time. Let's go. Okay, we got a little bit of time. So, I'll give you a little bit of the the long rundown here. So, yeah, got into e-commerce. Uh, well, I'll even go a little bit before that cuz we're going the long version here. So, before that, I actually started with Instagram growth marketing. So, that's how I really got into the digital marketing world. Um, so back in the time of the explore page with Instagram, there was a way to make content pretty much go viral on demand. It was right when Instagram introduced it. So kind of found a crack in that algorithm over there and there was a bit of arbitrage there. So I was able to grow a few accounts. I got a few clients and that was like my first real taste of just digital marketing as a whole. From there I kind of stopped. I was in university at the time and it was during co when you know I didn't really have much going on and I was looking for jobs at the time at uh I went to Florida State University. They have a very good film program over there, but unfortunately I was film super good, bro. No, they're actually like top five in in the nation there. Um, and yeah, for me when I uh when I got there, I wanted to join the program, but unfortunately I was nowhere near talented enough to get into that program. So instead, um, I was doing creative writing and I'm like, you know what, let me try to get an internship at a a big film company. So I was applying for a bunch of different jobs, HBO, all that kind of stuff. probably applied to a hundred different jobs. Didn't hear back from 95 of them. Heard back from five and four of them were just telling me that I was not even going to get an interview with them. So, I got one interview with HBO. Took the interview, pretty much completely botch it. And then at that point, I'm like, "Okay, you know what? Let me go all into this digital marketing stuff. It's pretty interesting." I saw some, you know, results from the Instagram stuff. So, pretty much locked myself in a room, started learning for, you know, 14 hours, 16 hour days just going down the YouTube rabbit hole. came across drop shipping, started doing some drop shipping, had some success very early on. I got to probably around like 15,000 a month, 20,000 a month within like the first few weeks of doing it. So, I'm like, "Okay, there's something really here." went very deep into it where I wanted to do a lot of the the things that in hindsight you know I'm happy I did all these things but now what knowing what I know I would have taken a completely different approach where I'm like I have to you know now create the perfect product create you know the perfect road map of how I'm going to launch it and I took a bunch of time to actually create a software so at the time I can go into what product I was selling so I was selling foot insoles that's what I would later get into selling but my stepfather um he was a podiatrist. So, I had a little bit of connections into that industry. Learned a lot about just foot and ankle injuries. I know way too much about the foot and ankle. Um, and pretty much developed like a software there where I was trying to create an interactive doctor visit. So, I like did a whole recording with him. invested probably like 10 grand out of my own money, pretty much all the money I had into building a software where we could create like an interactive software to diagnose different foot injuries and then try to lead them to different solutions for it. Uh that completely flopped and I took probably nine months developing that. But at the end of it, throughout that whole process, I started spending a lot of time developing different products because through that process, my stepfather, he actually needed products for his office. And I found out there was a lot of arbitrage there because they were ordering products for about it was this uh compression sleeve for your ankle. It's called Malot Train. And they were buying it for $78 a unit. I was able to get pretty much the same exact quality for $4 in China. So I ordered for his office. He's like, "All right, I got five other offices I can get this into." Got me the connection. So I started going actually B2B on the e-commerce side, making some decent cash flow from that. And then from all that, I'm like, "All right, you know, let me give this another crack. Just go. I'll take the best product that we had over here. Let's give it a launch. So, it was the insoles over there. I'm like, "This product is really good." You know, we've tested it. I've probably got like 30 iterations of this product for the office because that was like one of the main things that they were selling. And that just took off. So, like within a matter of a few months, got to my first six figure months. Then that started scaling up, got it all the way up to around 300,000 a month. And through that, I started going to a bunch of e-commerce networking events, started meeting with some different people, and that's actually where I met one of my first business partners that introduced me to the other B business partners um at an event actually, Alex Fedoff, if you know him. Uh so, shout out ESS. But that's where I actually met my uh first business partner. He was one of the speakers at the event. We connected. We started an agency together while I was still running my own brand. From there, we actually got another partner that he was working with on a separate agency. So, they were doing like a Google ads agency. My specialty was more in like the Facebook ad side. So, this guy was doing Google ads. My partner had done just a lot more of like the finance and understanding a lot more just from like a P&L standpoint, all that kind of stuff. And then one of our other clients that we ended up taking on for the agency had a warehouse in Miami, which was something I struggled with early on was the whole supply chain aspect of e-commerce. So we kind of all came together where we had very unique skill sets where for me I was a direct response Facebook marketer. One of my partners very good with Google ads and understanding that whole infrastructure and more like cold traffic with Google ads. So not just you know the traditional PMAX and you know retargeting kind of stuff. Other partner very good with finance, Amazon logistics and then other one you know had the whole warehouse customer service all that kind of stuff. So we all came together launched a brand that took off super quickly. It unlocked a whole new level level of scale pretty much within within the first 3 months of doing that. I think we got to 2 million a month with one of the products that we launched. Launched another product. Within probably 3 to four months, we were already at 6 million a month. So, we scaled it, you know, insanely quick. I I think mainly because all of us had like those missing components that we didn't have before. And so, all of us had e-commerce experience before. All had done like our own brands. All scaled, you know, to six figure months. But when we kind of all came together, it was all just unique skill sets coming together to really help take this thing off. And yeah, so that kind of leads us to where we're at now. That's a long version of the story, but yeah, it's good. Yeah, a million questions from that. So yeah, to clarify, you don't have to dox like industry or whatever company any be. So you guys launched a new brand. So you three came together and then launched completely new brand, new everything, right, from scratch. Okay, cool. Exactly. Yeah, I see that happen all the time. time. I mean, that's kind of how our model is with three partners where it's like each one lives in their own bucket. It's not as much like with ecom versus info, right? You need the brand face, the product, like that's part of it as one person usually is like the expert of the product and then you have though you have sales and marketing and then you have ops, system, tech, finance, like that bucket. So, that's basically our model too for the for partnership. Um, but yeah, I I mean we're in what's it called? Ezra Firestone's blue ribbon mastermind and dude it just the people in there and the deals that get done and connect like masterminds. So talk about talk about that. So talk about your because you said you go to masterminds, you went to meet these people like is it constant, right? You always see something new in like e-commerce education that's either you know like I know people that are like oh right now I'm teaching this education specific thing. They're doing hundreds of thousands a month teaching people how to do Facebook ads uh basically for that like is there always a new trend? Are you in all the communities and they change the content? Like how do you learn this? Yeah, it's a great question. Um, nowadays I'm actually in pretty much no communities, but early on it was definitely like I I definitely want to give a lot of credit to being in communities to helping me grow as quickly as I think I did. Um, because I think in those early stages there's a lot more access to the information you need. So like when you're at, you know, 50K a month or, you know, when I joined the program, I think my my store was probably it was actually like when I first was getting started is when I joined the program. So I think I was at like 15k 20k with the insoles like the first month that I launched it and then I was able to scale it up to like 100 grand within 90 days from there or so. So I think that gap of information of like 10k to 100k there's a lot of really good experts that can help you get there super quickly and you know you could try to explore on your own and I think you can have a lot of success just going you know on YouTube and especially now with the amount of information that's out there you can definitely do it all your on your own but I think also at the time when I was doing this there was less free information in terms of how to scale so that stage crucial I think where it becomes a little bit more difficult is more the stage where I'm at now and you know I'm I'm curious for you cuz I know you joined a bunch of masterminds and you'll probably have some good recommendations for me because this is something I've struggled a bit with. Um cuz I've joined other programs since then. Um I joined uh and maybe not the best programs for e-commerce specifically. I don't want to actually name any cuz I I don't want to talk bad about any of the the public ones. Um but I joined a few and I wasn't as impressed with a lot of like the ones that I've joined since the the initial growth. Um, so I'm curious from you like what are some of the best that you've been in and like what kind of results has that got for you? Yeah, the example you just said, right? Well, so like we are in uh Blue Ribbon. We still play Pay Root Blue Ribbon. I don't even know what it is now. 1,500 2,000 something a month. I've heard really good things about them by the way. Fantastic, bro. He is such a genuine like transparent dude. And there are whales in there. Like we were at one and the AG1 guys were I'm sorry. I think it was either AG1 or uh what's the mushroom one? the rise everyday dose. No, there's like the big big one. Uh Mudwater. It was either Mudwater or I'm blanking so hard. I'll think of it in 30 seconds. It's got to be one of those ones. Got to be one. Um but yeah, I mean those guys are just in the room like at the networking event. It's cool. So how he does his is kind of similar to like almost how I'm doing this except obviously packaged 9,000 times more and with a payw wall because I think people value it more and then it's inner community. So he's basically building he has brands and I think he actually might have exited some of them now but he has the ecom stuff where he started now he has software now he has like private equity stuff now he has a million things software to Shopify he was the uh ocu or whatever that thing's called like yeah yeah we use his software actually we've done a lot of money with his software yeah so like he's built all this stuff in the ecosystem and then all around at the same time he has literally he'll pop open his ad accounts he has you know Molly in there which at a at the time was whatever there's all these connections of his team that then share all this stuff as paid. So they will then create all these resources. You become a member, you get access to their whole library of stuff on Smart Marketer or whatever it's called now. Um yeah, it's amazing. And then like literally the group coaching calls and the weekly stuff is you just pop on there and he's like, "Okay, here's this new ad account thing. Here's how we're doing promotion calendars. Here's this new thing we learned about 3PL or this new processing thing or this new AI retargeting thing that came out that we're testing. Here's our results so far." He's just like open a screen share and just go through his stuff like he's he's sold me already, bro. I'm joining after this call, bro. Yeah, I don't even know what it is. I think it's at the time maybe it was 10 or 20. I don't even know actually, but I I know it was probably five figures I think to join and then whatever recurring, which I also FYI to anyone love that model for proper more like B2B masterminds. I think it's great to kind of gate it a little bit and then have the recurring versus just like this low recurring because people come in and try and like just eat everything and then dip and you want the community. That's the big thing. He is the most genuine like he'll even say he's like, "Oh, it's like my family. It's like my family in here." And he's so close-knit. People stay so sticky. So, that one for there. And then I'm on the hunt. Uh I'm trying to navigate who it is for info coaching. I just I I posted on X or tweeted. I don't even know what you're supposed to say anymore, but I post it on there. I'm trying to find what it is for info and coaching because right now almost everyone's language is around personal branding and like how to monetize your personal brand. It's like, okay, that's not how it not to say that won't work. Obviously, it's working for a lot of people, but that's like for the person who wants the personal brand versus old language was about kind of like how to become a coach, consultant, how to monetize your skill set, which is different than a personal brand. Um, but I can see how they're like in alignment. But I'm trying to find that because I'm trying to find who are like the goats in that space. Um I'm scheming on some stuff. But I want But you joined Iman's thing, right? Yeah, dude. Iman's a legend. I mean, he's the goat for sure. And that his is framed a lot. His is a great example. His is framed a lot about personal branding thing. And that's like kind of the reason that I did it at some level. It really was. I just paid my 20 grand and then it was a case to like record and all this. He teaches they teach so much stuff in there like access to the education the or I'm sorry the access to the sea level um or in the coaching calls the school but the big thing with that is like uh they go so far in that direction and I'm like doing this like they're like all the film stuff they have like three-hour videos on how to do this and this and this and like studio setups and lighting and clipping and like doing and like owning your own distribution and I like literally went I watched it all but I like went this far into actually doing it. But yeah, he does great. But that one uh that one is built for people who do over 250k and then he's got a whole suite of other programs. But he's a legend. But to give you your flowers, bro, I think you're a monster, dude. You've you've been consistent. What is this? 87 in a row, bro, of just posting every single day. 85, I think, is you and me. No, 86. Nice, bro. I was telling you when we spoke like, bro, I started the personal brand similar time, I think, to you. And I've been doing maybe one every like one or two weeks. And bro, that's a pain in the ass. So I can imagine just doing it every single day. I think you you've got a rhythm though of how you're doing. I've definitely got a rhythm down. I'm definitely hacking it a little now where I do these because the creation of the mirror board, the ideation like even though it's so basic, it like did take me a while and I was just kind of trying to be like what's hot now, which is like in the beginning it was all about the marketing stuff. Then it was all about sales and like stuff. Now it's all about data, tech, systems, and ops. And it's like that's where I'm like actually thinking. And I don't know, it kind of bounces a lot. But when I do these, they're nice because people pick up nuggets. So yeah. Yeah. I mean if you want to get I mean I'm sure what people want and again back to my process. I didn't do the proper tweet before this one or yesterday because I'm busy and [ __ ] and I'm like oh I have a call and uh so apologies. There's no queue of questions we have from these but I did look and I have X open right now. So everyone talks I mean you talk MR game which is obviously different. You talk a lot of paid which is pretty normal but like not sure if you go beyond that. And then yeah I mean subscriptions and paid right like what are what are some nuggets in there? like where are you where do you guys scale in? Do you do one-time upfront and subscription? Do you only do subscription? Do you do subscription on the back end? What's churn expected on that kind of stuff? Does it change from skew? Like deep drive. Yep. Um so the subscription stuff has been probably the biggest breakthrough I've had in probably the last like two years of doing this. It's like you know I think initially we had a a separate model where our our method of scaling is kind of what I was saying in the beginning where I think the collision of all the different skill sets between me and the co-founders here where we were able to bridge the gap between cold traffic on Google and cold traffic on Facebook. I think that combination together while also being able to manage the supply chain aspect and backend process of scaling that all up was the first like big arbitrage opportunity of being multi-channel to cold traffic that allowed us to get to multi-millions a month in scale. Now I think this is probably a bigger revelation where we've always gone with selling more physical types of products. So like the subscription stuff has been newer and we've got very creative with different ways of how we've looked at it. Um but now moving to more of these consumable products where it's a different landscape but for us you know the the big difference just to you know simplify it for and I'm sure a lot of the guys that are already doing you know supplements and stuff like this this is going to be very basic for them. But for the people that aren't as aware of like how the model really works is the difference is where the way we were doing it before is we were always trying to maintain between 15% and 20% profit on day one sales and we were doing that at multi-millions a month in scale. So as we were scaling up to you know 4 million a month 6 million a month we were doing that profitable on that first day purchase. Now the difference of this model and where we're shifting and we haven't gone all the way to this side because it's a it's a very fine line of balancing your cash flow to be able to manage it and this is like the direction where we're going where I think by hopefully the next year I don't I don't want to you know be too premature in it but like my goal over the next we'll call it two years is to get to around 10 million a month in scale. Um and I spoke with some you know good people on this that are in the space where they also changed my perspective. I don't want to go on a tangent. I'll come back to that after in terms of if you actually want to scale that aggressive, which was super interesting. Um, but the model here is that within 90 days, the goal should be, and this is how the big brands that are doing it. So, if you look at rise coffee, if you look at everyday dose, they're doing it based on breaking even usually within a 90-day window. So, for us, we're profitable on day one. For them, they're breaking even sometimes even longer. like the the more money that a brand has, some people will extend that out to 6 months. But beyond that, it gets a little bit risky because even if you have a shitload of data, it still gets a little bit murky in terms of like how far you want to go out with it. And that's why I think a lot of the the brands uh the big brands like Casper, for example, and those ones, they were trying to extend it out all the way to a year where they're going to try to like break even on that. So that's where I think it gets a bit murky because now your cash flow cycle is getting delayed and delayed. Um, but 90 days is a sweet spot from, you know, the consulting that I've done and the different brands that I've spoke to and a lot of the poaching that I do. Um, which is consulting within itself is that's that's kind of the sweet spot. So, what happens here is, you know, to illustrate it with very simple numbers is let's say your average order value is $50. Let's say that you need a two return on ad spend to make that 20% profit margin. Let's just use that for the example. So that means you have $25 to go and acquire a customer at that $50 average order value price point. Now what happens is if you can extend that out to now 90 days and let's say it's breaking even and not making that two return on ad spend. So let's say the break even is a 1.5. Um and not to do mental math because I don't want to get embarrassed here on the spot. So let's do 50 50 divided by 1.5 would be $33. Um, so based on that, let's do 50 divided by 33. That would be okay. So we got to the 1.5 on that. Um, so what would happen there is that you can now spend at the break even number within a 90-day window, you could extend an additional, excuse me. Sorry, I'm just going to do the the math on it. You're good. Plotting into the calculator over here. I'm over here still trying to think of my mushroom thing. Yeah. So, yeah, long story short, not to get too caught up on the math, but pretty much what you can do is now go at a one:1. So, instead of because you're going to move this back to day one acquisition and to not over complicate on that math, pretty much what will happen is on day one, instead of spending $25 to acquire that $50 customer, you can now spend $50 to acquire that customer. Because what will start to happen is over 90 days, depending on what your retention cohorts cohorts are, excuse me, for month one, two, and three. So, let's say you retain 70% after month one, 50% after month two, 30% after month three. we'd have to plot all these numbers out. So that's why I'll just use like makebelieve numbers so we don't get too in the weeds of it. Um but pretty much in that case like let's just say now you could spend $50. So you can double the cost of acquisition that you were spending before still break even in 90 days and then probably make the same amount of profit within like 6 months. So what that does is now it allows you to outbid your competitors which in Facebook you know I know you're a big Facebook marketer. I don't know if you're doing the marketing directly but you know I'm sure you know all about that. So the person that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins. So that's the super simplified version of it. Obviously there's a lot more complexities to it. Um so now the game becomes more so how do you optimize those really the first three month cohorts because if you're going to do it on a 90-day window then you want to get your retention rate on month 1, two, and three to be to be as high as possible obviously. Um but then also you know it's doing the things that you would do normally. So maximizing your AOV, you also want to maximize the thing beforehand, which is how many people from new customers are opting into your subscription program to begin with because, you know, if you're first launching it and you're doing like an option to subscribe and save, you might give them 20% off, but if you're only getting, you know, 20% of people to opt into the to the subscription model, then you can't really base your whole business model around it. So then it's figuring out how do you get that to 80% plus. That's what you have. So happy to go deeper on that. Yeah, let's go deeper on that because I want to talk too, right? So we're talking you said your first breakthrough and your second and I don't know how fast you want to go through first but so breaking it on cold on Google. So when you're doing that is that what what do you mean by that? Is that breaking it on search? Is that on shopping? Like I'm not super familiar. I mean what we do is all branded and then we'll do YouTube we'll do you know stuff like that like a little we don't really cold search but we'll do cold YouTube and like GD you know some stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. So for us at the time it was actually cold search but I think it can be a lot of like it doesn't have to just be Google I think that's just the example that worked for us but I think if you can have two sources whether that's apploving you know that's a big one nowadays in e-commerce where a lot of people are scaling just as aggressively as they were on meta with applovening so that's one right like Tik Tok is another one uh YouTube can be another one so all these together they uh when when you combine two of them together to acquire new customers customers. I think that's where you get the real breakthrough because now you're not just relying on Facebook. And the example I give with Facebook is that the way it works is it's very volatile and especially if you're doing the model that I was mentioning before where you don't have that subscription revenue coming in. You don't have that 90-day lifetime value coming in. You're relying on making money on day one. So with Facebook, the the nature of the platform, especially after iOS, is that you'll have some days that are amazing, some days that will go down, and it's just going to be volatile. even at higher levels of spend. It's just the nature of the platform. So, when you can balance that out with another channel that can have consistency because the odds of both of them not doing well on the same day is very unlikely because it's different customer segments that are, you know, shopping on each of those platforms. So, it keeps a lot of stability in the business, especially as you're trying to scale up. So, like if Facebook has a [ __ ] day, Google search probably can still do well that day or you know, YouTube ads or Tik Tok or whatever it may be. So that was kind of the first breakthrough to creating more stability where search for us was kind of like the stable backbone because it was a lot more consistent, a lot more profitable but less scale capacity where Facebook we could scale way more aggressively but it was a lot more volatile and numbers would go up and down up and down. So that was the first piece. Got it. Yeah. And then second piece so 80% take on subscriptions. So is it what is that framed as subscription only and then there's it's almost the other way around. So it's like or you pay it one time for an increase. Yeah. So actually for us we would probably be closer to 100%. Um but the problem is so we do installment payments and so we use shop pay for monthly installments. So we let people break it down into like four different payments and they actually don't allow you to do subscription on it. So the way that we do it is we send it very similar to Rise Coffee that they're the best example to study um in this model. So they do it where pretty much they send you to a page and your only option is to subscribe to get the offer. So they give you a bunch of [ __ ] with the product that you buy. It's a really compelling offer and to get that offer, you have to subscribe or you can go to like Amazon and buy from there like individually, but if you're going to buy from their Shopify website, you only have one option. So that for us, yeah, that for us has worked the best. Obviously, you like you can't do that in a sketchy way. You have to let people know that they're subscribing. You have to put in I'm on it right now. I'm on it right now. Yeah. And it opens me up in shop pay as my initial because I'm already in there. But then all the bonuses basically. Yeah. Exactly. So they give you app, your magnet, your spoon, your scoop, but then but then they do an automatic discount and then drop you to $27 a month. And funny enough, you mentioned like the mushroom coffee brands, but like all those guys are pretty much running the same exact model. So they're all running it just like that. And that's how all of them are scaling. And that's really the only way like especially if you're in one of those niches where you're competing against people that are doing the model that I just spoke about, you're [ __ ] right? Like if you're going to do it without like a subscription program when these guys can spend, you know, some of them like some of these mushroom coffee brands are probably going all the way up to 6 months breaking even before they make their profit. Yeah. You're screwed. You're cooked. like you can't compete against that unless you have, you know, either really strong lifetime value that's not associated with a subscription program or insanely high AOV and average order value that you have like a direct response salesunnel that you're fully like boosting everything. Then that's the other option. You could frontload a lot of that initial average order value and be able to scale. And that's how like some of the DR guys have got to like 100 million a year with no subscription. So, that's that's kind of the options I would say in D TOC if you want to get to 100 million is either monster AOV. My bad for Bing. I just got too excited on the AOV. Um, Monster AOV or uh the LTV. Interesting. Okay. So, do you know these rise guys before we just do this before I start talking about them more? I don't want I don't want to torch someone's funnel, but I guess we're already in it. Um, I don't know them personally. I don't know the founders now. So, like this example, let's just because I just want to use an example on this. So these guys right $27 right now and I don't know how to share screen on this cuz it's telling me I need to restart my computer and whatever and I don't care. So uh it so they're basically it says $27. It's normally 36 a month uh and it's 27. So they are just hammering at this one skew and let's talk like backend. Let's talk fulfillment. So these guys what like how easy is it? I have I'm so off base on this. Like we talk maybe about supplements and all this kind of stuff and even you and I chat about that but like I don't even know where to start. I mean I have the people in in in DM and in message that's like oh we can white label this or we can custom formulate this like what is this as an example or again without doxing your own stuff like how do you go about that like in terms of like sourcing the product? How would I make that product and how much would it cost me to make that product for example? Yeah. So for all consumable products, I definitely recommend doing it in the United States. Uh in terms of the actual like process there, so that's one of my partners that handles all that. So full shout out and credit to him on that um for, you know, sourcing all that. But pretty much the process at a high level for that is, you know, you have to it it's difficult with consumables. It's definitely more difficult than when you're selling like physical products because there's usually pretty highQ that you're going to need for the initial base purchase. So unless you have some money to invest or if you're willing to, you know, search through, you know, 50 100 different people that are willing to get you, you know, a lowQ to test it out that you can like really sell them on the on the vision of why they should. And, you know, for someone like you though, for example, where you have a successful business that you can show them that, it's going to be much easier for you where if I was someone that was just starting that wanted to do it, it's going to be more challenging obviously. Um, but I think that also the other piece is if you have good connections, like we actually met our person from a, so this is, you know, a little bit of a backtrack, but we were going more in like the at a point we were at like five different brands, six different brands. Uh, and I don't know if you can even call them full brands because we were more just like individual products that were starting to scale up and we're like, all right, do we develop this into like real brands? Um, and through that we actually were going to partner with a pretty big influencer in the fitness space. And with them, they actually had a connection because they already started like developing a product with this guy and like they had, you know, some clout, some, you know, recognition. They already had the product like in in the process with this guy. So, he was able to give us like pretty lowQ like test out a new concept, test some stuff out where we were actually able to then build a really good relationship with him to like start all the process. So connections is another really good way of like how you can get started with it. But I guess high level like the problem in the beginning is that high order quantity is required usually to develop your own type of consumable product. There is another option where you can actually just white label. So if it's like a very generic product um where you don't want to go as much in the formulations. There's a lot of you know facilities that will do it. You're just going to pay a premium on your average unit cost if you do it that way. Um, so that's a good way to test and validate a concept and then start to do some custom formulations from there. Like if you want to get started pretty early on it um but I highly advise against doing it in China which I see a lot of people doing now especially with like the Tik Tok stuff that all that stuff that's going on with Tik Tok shop obviously. Um, the problem with going into China with all this stuff, and it's not to say that all suppliers will be like this, but there is very little regulations in terms of the actual products that they're putting in and the actual dosages of each product, even if they are using good ingredients. Um, so yeah, long story short, you're going to probably get into some uh compliancy issues if you do that with them. Uh, maybe not right away, but, you know, it's it's something that you're going to have a big risk. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're huge on brand. Like the reason we didn't even do this initially was cuz it was like a time distraction and all that but also or like a focus distraction but also the quality. So that's why we were like trying to do this partnership route but like you do it with with the big enough partners and like you're only getting whatever 20% affiliate commission or something on top rung and like that math is like okay but right so and you don't get all like there's just all these ones. We had a really good quality one that was like, "Yeah, we'll give you 40%." But they were like of first purchase and it's like the whole point is that it's MR, right? Yeah. So, um, doesn't make sense. Yeah. We played that dance that line of trying to do it and I've talked on here before. We did a partnership with one that was really good, really high quality, all good. Um, which the math didn't math because we were doing the test kit, then they have to talk to them on the phone, then they sell them on the thing and like the drop off rates plus the AOV and whatever. Like the math just didn't math plus the commission rate. So yeah, we're talking about doing it, but brand, like you said, is so important. Quality is so important. And we hear that like, you know, supplements is a shady game. It's a shady game, US or China or wherever. And it's like, how do we make it so they're actually quality? They're actually unique, too, which is another interesting point is like everyone's got a protein powder, everyone's got a whatever. Like how do you do it beyond flavors? And you know, you can just basically match someone who is quality and but your unique piece is your marketing and your branding, right? is like what a lot of these guys say. So yeah, that's kind of the game we're playing with. Well, I'll give like a a nugget on that. Like I think one of the most underrated parts of like the supplement is everyone and their moms is selling, you know, the same types of formulas, right? So if you look at like neutropics for example, if you look at, you know, the the mushroom coffee, right? All those different things. I think the the low-key breakthrough is actually the delivery mechanism of how they get the benefit. So like for example going from like traditional pills to gummies where it's a much more enjoyable experience where it tastes really good. So I think if you look at all the trends especially with those really crowded markets of different supplements whenever there's a new innovation it's always usually because of like the mechanism maybe you know another ingredient or like combining different like different supplements and putting them together like that's one part of it but the actual way that you consume the supplement is a really big way of like how you can break through in saturated supplement spaces. Yeah that makes sense. We we're friends with some guys that do mid eight like or I guess what is that? Not mid eight figures but you know between 10 and 20 a month and they do supplement and it's it's like one hero and a couple like outside and they just crush but theirs is I think I know I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, I don't know. I'll have them on if they'll be on. We're not going to but yeah crush but um their whole idea was you know there's the other difference is that's so front end that's all paid driven. And that's, you know, not all paid, but you know what I mean? Like it's it's really heavy there versus what we're talking about doing is like, okay, we're going to sell it post purchase. So ours is going to be post info coaching. It's going to be like part of it. And then we're like, what do you because that's easier to just provide pure value and have that right there. And like customer acquisition cost is already kind of like drisked or like separated from there. But then the other piece is what could we create that is like what you're saying that's either a unique mechanism that is a mix that is unique in the marketplace in some way shape or form plus the marketing skills to make it so it could stand alone on the front. Um and that's like do we dedicate the time and energy do we just lean into our bucket but yeah subscription it's crazy. Yeah. Well, speaking to you specifically, we we chatted a little bit last time we spoke, but I think with your model, like I think one of the interesting routes which we spoke about last time was like looking to maybe acquire a different brand that already has like a decent run rate that you can build into it. And I think that, you know, going back to the initial example that I said, right, where the goal is if you can break even in 90 days, that gives you substantial room to then scale. I think the difference with your model is if you can find a supplement that directly correlates to the audience demographic that would be buying your programs, that's like a [ __ ] hack because now you're getting those customers. You can break even, but your LTV is going to be even stronger than the guys that are doing the supplements because you have even if it's like 5% of people that end up joining that high ticket program, even less, right? like from those from that customer base, you have like a substantial revenue source on the back end that like stacks on top of that lifetime value because the subscriptions really what it does is it brings predictability to LTV. That's what makes it so powerful is that now you can actually start to look at your data cohorts. You can start to like predict how much revenue you're going to do for the future. It changes the whole way you look at the business, but ultimately all it's predicting is the lifetime value. and you have a way to still raise that lifetime value probably 2x that amount just on the average basis of like getting those people into that program. And I was thinking about Yeah, I was thinking about this after we talked and I was like the only thing I I hang up on that versus doing it from scratch is I mean one there's the cash game and like the return on it and making sure that's there. two is like folding it into the ecosystem in terms and everything in branding in ascension in the ways that make sense because we've done we've had the conversations we've even tested doing it on the back of uh physical products um on supplements on things like that and like it's there but like the consumption and the warmth in order to go from buying a $50 supplement recurring to a whatever high ticket program is like not so you almost need like that middle middle gap and then the branding you know there's potential to have a 5x multiplier style thing. Not like eBay like like just results, not any selling, but like 5x multiplier on if it's branded in alignment and the LA, you know, I don't know that the move is buy something that has all this MR and then just flip the name and flip the color scheme and do whatever. So, it'd be like a Yeah, it'd be very specific to find, but let that interesting point you bring on now because acquisitions. So, yeah. Where where are you guys at right now? So, you said you've had five or six which were essentially just individualized products. You scale them up. E-commerce is super cool to me because inherently it has uh easier than something like info coaching or someone's face and brand uh easier easier to sell right like still you need to get up to numbers good business you know growing all the things but it is easier to do so in my opinion so have you sold any are you going to try and sell any do these even sell yours yeah I I guess without going into too much detail we're in the process of exiting one of our brands so this has been a bigger brand which we've had for a little while So that we're we're trying to exit. And then really right now um you know we've went a back and forth on a lot of different like ideas and concepts of what we could do. Um but what we found is in the process of like scaling up to like and I don't want to call it full-fledged brands because it wasn't developed brands. It was more like again like individual products that we were just scaling up all in parallel. Um but it really drove down the focus and I think that what we saw is the products that we scaled up super quickly initially those ones started to go down in sales and overall the ecosystem went down in sales even though we had more products that were doing you know well individually right so I think that what we found in that is that focus is really the most valuable asset right now in terms of scaling the brands until like the only way I feel like you can really go into that model of having five six seven different brands is that if you're so systematized and you have a fully autonomous or virtually fully autonomous team where you're really just like a strategic person that's coming in there and just like guiding those different brands and everything is dialed like then that that process makes sense and it's a very like repeatable process too. Um but we found that we weren't there yet when we tried to do it. Maybe you know in the coming year or two you know somewhere along those lines maybe we'll get back to that point. But I want to be extra cautious this time just learning from like past mistakes of doing it. So I think once we exit one of the brands, we're probably going to like fully dive into one of the brands that I think has potential to be a multi-figure brand. Um, and I think from like just the the pure numbers that we have right now cuz as I mentioned earlier is that we we haven't fully went into that model of breaking at breaking even at 90 days. like we're we're slowly approaching it cuz it is it is a lot to endure cuz you have to like make sure especially cuz what will happen you know is if you go to 90 days where you're willing to now break even and you can double up how much you're willing to spend on cost of acquisition let's just say you also can then probably scale like 2 3x the amount which means you also have to then um think about how are you going to supply the inventory for that right that that's going to cost you a shitload of money as well to go up to that scale plus you're not going to see that money for an additional 90 days where you have to float it. So that's what the most challenging part that we're finding right now is the actual finance component of like how do you maneuver scaling it especially if you're bootstrapped. Uh and we don't want to raise money as of yet. Um it's not to say that will change in the future. I'm not like closed off to it but for now we're trying to keep everything you know internal. So I think that's going to require a shitload of focus. So for us right now we want to like be super focused on that. Get this thing to you know 10 million a month nine figure brand. And then once we have that, I think also the same thing applies where, you know, what I found is once you figure out how to take a brand to seven figures a month, it becomes repeatable. Same thing with, you know, when you get to that first six figures a month. So I want to get to that, you know, eight figure a month run rate, figure out how to actually do that and then, you know, use that kind of as our basis of like a holding company and, you know, going into there. Yeah. Interesting. Um, because you said that earlier a little bit and I always ask almost everybody on here, uh, like how how far can you take it, right? And this one's a little bit easier of an example, right? How big these e-commerce companies can get a little something like an info coaching where you've got like Tony Robbins and these guys that go up top tier, but beyond that, the there's nobody in the middle or there's very few in the middle. Uh yeah, but yeah, that's So with what your plans are, why Well, let's back up a little bit. So a normal ecom business is what 20% margins like a the healthy one or higher? Uh between 10 to 20%. 10 to 20. Okay. And that's obviously the ones that are heavy on paid. And then yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like if you're more organic focused, you can get it up to like 30%. But yeah, I would say 10 to 20% is pretty standard. And you you'd be surprised, but a lot more closer to that 10% mark. Like 20% is like what everyone kind of shows, but usually, especially at high scale scenarios, especially when we're scaling now to like aggressive months, like 10% is, you know, we're we're happy with that. Yeah, 100%. Um, interesting. And then multiples are industry standard then for get over 2 million, 5 million, 10 million in IBIDA or whatever number and then those are yours, five, eight, 10x's. Yeah. Well, I think that's what's super interesting I guess just about private equity in general, right? Is like the the bigger you can scale a brand, the more the multiples go up. So like in the IBIDA levels, like if you're in that, you know, base 1 to 5 million range, you know, you'll probably see, you know, depending on how well your brand is actually set up, you might get, you know, a 2x multiple on that if it's really shitty. Uh if it's better, you might get like a 4x 5x in that range. Um and that's just really what what people are willing to pay, at least from the experience that I've had throughout this whole buying process. Um, but when you get to that higher level, so like let's say, you know, 5 to 10 million and then 10 million plus, 10 million plus, you could probably see like 5 to 8x, 5 to 10x. If you're in like a, you know, beverage business, you can get like a 20x on it. So like there's really outsized returns depending also on like the type of product, the retention program, like all those different components can really stack up. So it's hard to say like one benchmark for it but like if you're very intentional and you're you know wellversed in e-commerce where this is also what I'm realizing like the more that I understand and you know and this is something actually it's a good way to circle back to something I was saying earlier in the call where I got this advice from from a founder um that I think you know as well but he told me cuz I was saying you know my goal is I want to scale to 10 million a month in the next six months and he's like why do you want to do do that. And I and he's like, "What's your longer term goal?" I'm like, "I want to get this thing to multiple hundreds of millions a year and exit for, you know, 200 300 million." He's like, "Well, you know, those two goals don't directly correlate with each other because if you're saying you want to scale up to 10 million a month within 6 months, do you think that's going to be sustainable?" And I thought for a second, I'm like, you know, I think, you know, with the subscription program, maybe it could be sustainable. But then I thought about like just my my journey so far when I've scaled up, you know, six million a month and then we went down to like four million a month and then even back down to two million a month and then back up like and this is something I've learned in the process of actually selling a brand is the worst possible thing you can have is a decline in your numbers because even if we were to do 10 million one year, scale that brand up to 30 million and then the next year we go back down to 15 million let's just say whereas like let's say instead we went 10 million, 15 million, 20 million or something like that where overall it's going to be less revenue. Let's just say in that example, the second one, but it's steady increases up. That business is going to give you a much better multiple at the end. Even though you had a year that you did better than all the other years and the revenue overall is higher because everything is based on the trailing 12 months. So, I thought about that for a second. I'm like, you know, we probably should do a lot more work on setting up this foundation, right? making sure that the churn is going to stay like making sure that all those pieces like the cohorts are fully optimized within the first three months before just trying to like you know take the brakes off this thing and you know scale as aggressively as possible. So it reframed a lot of how I thought about it um in terms of the exit and I guess that kind of ties into the whole point of you know you should plan with exit in mind if that is your goal. If your goal is to build a brand and you want to have it for the long run it's it's a different story but if you do want to make a big payday think about that when you're starting a brand. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's uh that's so funny you say that because we've increased every single year, right? And last year we went we 3xed and everything broke on the tail end of the year cuz that would have been that I mean that was on pace for instead of 30 it would have been 40 and like mid-40s if we would have kept that trajectory where everything like this and then instead it went like this and like even at the beginning of this year we're like rebuilding we're like can we restart the clock right now because like we're rebuilding everything but it's like if you look at it on annual basis now we're doing this again and it's like if we can get back up we should be able to pass that from last year but if you look month over month it's like you know one of these on cash collected not on revenue because the stuff's over coaching and whatever, but you know, different terms, different whatever. But, um, no, that's super interesting. Um, and then the other thing with that, the like you said, making it a machine, making it in those ways that it could be sold, it's just a different play. It's a different play than cash because you're, you know, you have four extra people on your team instead of you guys just pirating it and you're just paying out those that would be cash straight in your pocket and, you know, navigating that. So, super interesting. Okay. So you've got these two right now and then did you say your your guys peak month that you've done ever was six? Six. Yeah. Six. That's crazy though. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Got to break past it, man. Got to break past it. Yeah. So something like that. And again, I don't want to get details, but like to start something like that for you, and I'm getting a little selfish here, and I keep saying that on these, but I use these for that a little bit, but like Yeah. What's what's your minimum order? Like how much does that thing start cost to start? 50 grand in inventory and load up a Shopify and like go to war or like I mean it depends how scrappy you want to be, right? I I think 50 grand is a good budget to to be conservative, but if you want to be super scrappy, you could probably get it done 10 to 20k to you know if you can find a good supplier that will give you like lowQ to get the initial base like you can probably start to test and validate something within that range. Uh and then also it was something I was thinking about when you were also describing you know your model. I think another big benefit of how you can do it is that you actually have a lot of benefits of how you can keep people retained into the subscription program because I think with the with the supplements if it directly correlates with you know the weight loss and all that kind of stuff and it's a pivotal part you need that goes handinhand with the workouts that people are going to do you can give them extended discounts into your high ticket program when they stay subscribed for like a certain amount of time so there's a lot of like mix and matching where I think you can get multiple benefits, super high LTV and super high retention rates, which is ultimately the most important thing if you're going to do this model is the retention side, which is a big shift cuz for me, you know, everything was always how do I make the most money on day one, which now thinking about retention, it's like a whole new brain that you have to like unlock of like how do you keep people like sustained? How do you make the product as good as possible? Like all those things are way more important than just the the base marketing now. Well, that's why everyone calls us stupid all the time when I talk to him who doesn't have a ton of context and like half I mean they're they're right depending on how you look at it, right? It is stupid to not do it, but it's also not stupid in sense of like how we've position this. But when we had these LOL months, uh this would have been very nice to have whatever number. But like I mean I'm using very simple examples, but it's like okay cool. How do we get to 100K a month in MR? Like call a supplement bundle 150 bucks, right? Like a month and it's probably more. I mean I pay more than that for supplements a month personally and I take three or four things. So it's like 150 that's only 650 units or you know purchases a month. Yeah. Which is like not that crazy assuming we sell you know these are not actual numbers you funnel hackers you. Um but let's say let's say 500 let's say whatever a thous like that's not that crazy to get yeah to get let's say 20% 30% of your customers that come in to then do that. Uh, and then yeah, like we're doing annual plans, we're doing multi-year, like we're doing all these things now. So, yeah, if we can pair those, but that front end stuff is just so fun to us because we're direct guys like in this part of the company. The acquisition side, we like live over here. But yeah, I don't know. You see the scale and the size and it's always been like, oh, whatever. We sell 200 people a month, let's say, and half of them buy supplements and we're making another, you know, 30 bucks in profit per. It's like, who cares? Like, we were we've always been like that. Like, who cares? Which is dumb. I do agree that that because all those dollar those cents add up, you know, to dollars and those dollars add up to lots. Yeah. So interesting, man. Okay. So, but I think I think also just one one point on that is like the biggest thing for you is also, you know, I think the the sellability I don't even know if that's a word, but the sellibility of the company as a whole, right? Like if you can add that front-end product and even get it to that 100k a month and now you have a consumable product that you know is driving a lot of that initial purchases into the whole like program as a whole. That's going to make the business way more valuable. I feel like like just from like an investor standpoint or a buyer standpoint or whatever you guys want to do like raise money, sell it, whatever it is, like I think that's just going to make that process so much easier for you guys. Yeah, I have I was listening to I want to say Josh No. Shout out Josh No. uh I want to say it was him and if it wasn't he's going to get the credit for it anyway cuz he's a legend. Um, but it he basically talked about how when they were selling one of their businesses back when they were attempting to build out I feel like it was Josh who said this. They were attempting to build out basically like another vertical because it was in like affiliate lead gen like that whole game but similar idea, right? So they were attempting to build out this other vertical or had other ones but they had their core main one, right? Yeah. they went to sell, it was essentially just valued off the core one that was actually the machine that actually had like consistency around it and stuff and all these other ones really didn't. So, it's like they put all these resources into these other buckets to do that. And I almost wonder sometimes or Horosi talked about this in one of his more recent pods. He talks about how people stay because they were essentially doing like uh they're they're testing ads for people in local markets with their own money with company money and then once they have proven winners they put them in this deliverable and then people get them and that's like a re one of the many reasons they stay is to get these new ads that are fresh to test in their market or to run in their market. And yeah, when he said that, I was like, that's so interesting because what they really were valued off of in all these different ways, and you can look at it up and down, left and right, but is like certain pieces of the business that are truly recurring, that are truly, you know, an acquisition engine plus a future cash flow game. And like you're right, right? Like, yes, it will value it more. The funny part is is it may be more valuable is where my mind is at is like, is it more valuable? And like there's this whole info coaching game, but then you have subscription consumables that people stay on and that's like valued at some crazy number versus this other piece. And they play hand inand obviously because we'll be using one as acquisition for another and like it'll be a total LTV game. But yeah, we've uh we've done pretty poor and I've said this a lot uh we've done a pretty poor job of maximizing LTV and that was a big reason that why margins took a big dive. I mean like yes well not necessarily why margins took a big dive there but why they kind of continued on was because of how we did the acquisition over here and then how we fulfilled on it without any other offerings really on the back other than like stay for more which was not smart and we burned tens of millions of dollars of opportunity like they sit in some you know lost pipeline basically or like or or churned pipeline so maybe there's some back campaign but yeah we we left a ton on the table for not keeping definitely a bunch and look I I think the other interesting thing and I don't know how this would typically work cuz I'm I'm not as well versed with like the infos space and how everything is sold there but like I almost would think like you know depending on how successful you can do it and how long you can get like a a supplement brand going like let's say you get it you know a year or two really get some good revenue good momentum going on over there I would almost try to sell it to like an e-commerce acquirer or someone that's trying to buy like an e-commerce brand where you frame it you know where this is kind of the lead product and all this stuff that you have surrounding that product and it's like a different positioning of how you present it to like a a potential buyer where for them that's going to be something like they've never seen before where there's whole like coaching program on the back end of it and obviously the margins are unsustainable like if you were like in e-commerce you can't do the same types of margins you do in info um but obviously the sellability part of it is that's like I guess the turnoff on the info spot um so I feel like if you can figure out a way to like merge those and then present it into like a very compelling compelling offer that could be super interesting. And there's also a huge play, you know, but again, this kind of goes back against a point that I said where I think the key thing is like focus, right? And I think you know that more than anyone of just like how much can you take on without miserably, but yes. Yeah. Yeah. Without like losing focus on the main thing that's actually driving the revenue. So I think that's like obviously the the biggest risk. Um, but I do see like especially if the model works and then you can find other products to other front-end products for example that you can go out and acquire that are already doing good run rate. So like test and validate yourself so it's less risk. If that works really well and transitions really well into your overall program then you start buying different entry point brands that you know are lower run rates. You can get good deal. Your personal brand will help you attract probably good buyer or good sellers for that. use that, buy, you know, one or two different purchases. Now you're stacking up your IBIDA. You have different entry points for the consumable product. Get them all to some form of a subscription. Maybe it's a bundle of the different products that you have that all come together. Put that into the coaching program, run that out a year or two, get some nice numbers, get it on an incline, present it to like a buyer potentially, you know? So something like that could be, you know, I'm with you. I mean, and the focus thing is so funny because it's the opportunity flow that I have right now through this stuff is crazy. And I'm like, I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. Like, I just keep like repeating in my head. I'm like, oh my goodness. But there's like I'm trying to figure out the frame on that. And really like the the overall thinking of how I'm going about it is like don't touch something like real estate for example that where my learnings will not overlap as much. Like of course anywhere you learn something even how you think was can translate into your main thing. But I'm like, okay, we're info coaching, but if we roll physical product, it's internal. It's not like, oh, I'm going to start up some dog supplement brand, which shout out, I love that business model, but like this is like shiny. This lead gen thing is extremely shiny over here. And I'm like, oh, this lead genen and these paper call guys. I know all these guys. And I'm like, don't touch it. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Because it's not this is except right. So, it's like, okay, the physical products could be inhouse. So, like that pushes the main thing further. and where I have been thinking and you and I talked about this a little bit but like going upstream in info coaching to like that's that's where my frame is going and I don't consider that like oh I sell something like if I'm yeah I've got some like 0 to 10k course and all that kind of stuff which is like not my game uh anyway that I would but like kind of like the port co game kind of like the percent like it's almost agency but it's not because the fulfillment wouldn't be like deploy like full deployment but yeah You and I talked about that. We'll talk about that all because I think there there's a game to be played there that yeah with enough resources and experience in this I think monetized extremely well and super helpful for said port you know example port one stuck at whatever 3 to 500k a month in info it's like there's four levers that I am aware of or area you know they're just leaving on the ground doing some sort of like revshare deal like something like that I don't consider selling or like Yeah, you know, depending. But I don't know. I'm kind of like back and forth. It's like that that to me is also a little shiny object, but I would learn things that are info coaching based so it could apply. I don't know. But yeah, that's super funny on it because Yeah. No, I've had the same exact thought process as you with it. Um, especially with like It's funny you say the real estate thing because that's a conversation I actually recently just had with my partners because, you know, long story short, like we were talking a lot about like investing into real estate. they already had like some stuff in real estate beforehand, but that's something that I kind of was thinking through. I'm like, I don't know if those skill sets, you know, maybe there's some benefits of like, you know, tax deductions and pieces like that that you can translate over, but the the skill set that you're gaining there is a completely different one than what serves the main business. And that's really how I've always tried to think about things. If I ever were to synergize businesses with like the e-commerce stuff, especially like utilizing personal brand. Um, which right now, by the way, like I thought through it and I know we spoke about it. I don't think I'm going to do anything for the foreseeable future to be honest. Probably like next one to two years. I was going to go into it, but I'm like, nah, this is, you know, I have an opportunity right now to take this thing to $100 million a year, I want to say, dialed in there. And you know, again, once once all that plays out, you know, then we see. But like I think for now, just give value for free, build a good audience similar to what you're doing. I think that's that's the play for now. Um, but yeah, no, just on that point, like I think that I've always tried to look at things of how can I create a flywheel from the thing that I'm already doing. So if I were to do it, like the way I would think about it is with the personal brand. This is like my thought process and I'm curious like how you've thought about it on on this line as well. But if I do it and then you know hypothetically could leverage and this is like what Iman does, right? So I'm like this is the same type of model he does where he takes his actual SOPs that he's using to run his main business. He takes the core team that he's paying for his main business. He uses that seuite team plus those SOPs to create now a program that he can now monetize off of the core system that's making his main business run. And then you can extend that to even like softwares like potentially AI that you're using in your business to help you solve a function and then extend that out. So I've always looked at what are the things that I could do in my business to help me drive growth but potentially be able to monetize you know over on that side. But what I've come to the conclusion is that either way it's going to take a shitload of work and will distract you to some capacity most likely. Um so I think with that being said like you have to still focus is like your most valuable asset is how I look at it. So, you have to make sure that you you preserve that at all costs. Yeah, he's done a great job with that and I've talked to him about this a bit and um Yeah. Yeah. Using those resources and but then staying within the lane, right? Like you said, like using the current resources, not really distracting, just kind of going deeper like upstream or however you want to look at it uh within the same. The other thing is the which kind of relates to that is the capacity, right? Because if he has the high level team that can then be the service delivery for that or like a portion of it. I I sometimes wonder that I know we got to pop here soon because we said an hour, but um I sometimes wonder if like we have a lot of horsepower in owners, right? You even said the same thing. You have three different partners that have different skill sets, but like yeah, I sometimes wonder is like, okay, should all three of you or all three of us, for example, be like tripling down in this in our own right plus each other and it's 1 plus 1 plus, you know, 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 15. Or is it that you guys all have half in that still grows it like crazy, but you have your other things outside of it and it's like that's kind of this game of Yeah. And then at what scale do you get to like obviously way larger than where I'm at or you're at or whatever, let's say, but like way larger, but then you have these guys who do get up to the point where they have hold and all that and like that's not even in like the cards really. Like I said, kind of with this like rev share thing, I don't really view that as like a hold co because it's not equity. You're not like deploying team. you're not own them all outright. Like it's not like that. But yes, that's what I sometimes wonder is how much like there's no way we're already going all 100% into this. Like this even right now it's whatever 12:05 for me right now. I have 32 Slack messages since we've been on here and that's my own fault of like my skill set and whatever. And that's not necessarily but you know like this distracts from it but it doesn't. I also learn a bunch of stuff where I'm like okay cool there's overlap. I learn all this stuff. We have access to talent now. while we do all that, but where's the line? Where's the line? No, there's a lot of stuff I want to touch on now with you, like offline specifically. Like there's a few things I want to definitely dive into because I have a lot of thoughts on it. But I think just on that point like I think that's like uh that's also what makes it challenging for sure is when you have the other partners as well and obviously you're doing something and then that can distract you from the main business that you're working on as a whole as a whole and you know if they're not doing the same things like I think that's where it can become a lot of friction and that's also a big reason of why I'm actually holding back on it is I think because of those components as well. Um, but I think that like the way that you're doing it now, for example, and same with me, is, you know, I think posting now, like it doesn't take me that much time. You're doing every day, so I know for you it's probably a bit more, but you know, you've also grown super quickly, which is amazing, bro. But I think doing that obviously then opens up the the door like for me, I've been able to get on like some really highlevel consulting calls as a result of it completely for free because of me putting some stuff out there that now I can directly apply into the business. like what I said earlier, that was something I learned from a consulting call with someone that I met, which was a really valuable insight for me, which changed really my perspective on like the business that I'm building overall. So, I think that you unlock those nuggets by doing it right now, which you wouldn't have access to if you weren't doing it. So, it's like that type of mentorship, which you get access to because you're putting yourself out there, is so much more valuable to the business than the extra hours that you're putting in there. And it's not even you're probably taking hours outside. I'm sure if you're like me, you probably work all your waking hours pretty much. So like yeah, we just like like yeah I'm I'm on 16 hours a day and it's like even if I'm doing two hours over there, like I'll find [ __ ] to do for 14, which is not the most effective method. I very clear that I'm the same, bro. I'm the same. No, nothing. But like we have leverage now through team. So like you don't have to be on like this at all, but I don't know. It's like this morning I was on at 5 and I find these random things in reports and I plug them in channels and then people, you know, like I just like to do it. Uh it's definitely not the cleanest route, but like we talk about like you know some if you had someone in your life that needed you three hours a day because of some medical condition or something like you have the time to do the three hours a day. Like you know you'd make the time and like that's kind of how I look at it is like no matter what I enjoy this so much like these are my hobbies right so it's like how much would someone spend golfing plus this plus work and it's like you just got to combine all in one and it's about it's waking hours you know. No, 100%. Bro, I I look at it the same way. Like I really enjoy the personal brand stuff. Like I love, you know, I I think especially like in our type of position where I think there's le like the reason why I got into the personal branding in the first place is just because I love to yap about business, but there was less people for me to yap too. And I'm just like, you know what? I'm sure a lot of people can gain a lot of value if I just [ __ ] spew for 20 minutes just talk about it. People will get a lot of good insights from it. Plus, you know, all the benefits that will come as a result of it. So like it started really like from a passion first perspective of like I want to talk I want to meet cool people and you know obviously there's so much leverage from a personal brand so you can't ignore all those components but like I feel like that's what makes it like super easy to do. It's not like it's like a frustrating three hours you're putting in. It's like you're enjoying the the time that you're doing it. That is a perfect way to frame that. It's like I move back around like where I'm from and I have my hometown friends that are like you know 15year friends and great dudes crushing it all in their own game but like none of them are in online and like if nothing else I was [ __ ] annoying right like if nothing else I was annoying about how much I like this is all I do so it's all I talk right it's like funny you say that because now it's like I can just sit there and on my phone just like tweet something or like pop in my DMs and I can talk for hours with anything we do these for hours about it so it's ice cuz I talk about it less probably. Yeah, dude. That's not true. I don't talk about it less. Yeah. No, bro. I found myself like talking to my [ __ ] girlfriend about it. She's like, I don't give a [ __ ] about your [ __ ] bro. Same. Cool. You had to do what? Oh, that's amazing. You're onboarding a new whatever. Like, cool. And then I was talking about this and the That's what I knew. That That's when I knew, bro. Yeah. I've got room for the tax pieces and I'm like, "All right, man. Cool. We'll have to do another one that's a little more tactical because a lot of guys like that. These are these are I don't know that mid high level conversation that I like and just get. So, for sure, bro. For sure. Let's do another one, bro. Yeah, let's do another one. So, everyone, what finds you on X and YouTube? Those are the two. Yeah. X ecom moose. It's uh ecom with two M. So, EO M and then Moose on uh X and and Yeah, we got three M's, bro. But two M's in the ecom, bro. We go full out. I love it. Cuz we make it M's, bro. We do. Yeah, exactly. All right, cool. I will I'll have this live by end of day. For sure, bro. Good chatting. Awesome. All right. Be good, bro.
