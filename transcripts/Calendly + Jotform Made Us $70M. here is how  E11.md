What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through how we use application routing to keep our calendars as booked as possible all the time. All right, so this is the exact funnel that we used to do 30 million in cash collected last year, 70 million in total cash collected on this funnel. All right, so this channel is just me sharing what we've tried, what we're currently doing, uh how we're changing things to get to 100 million a year in cash collected and just documenting it along the way. All right, so let's get into it. So this application is actually V2. So, this is the 13th question here, but so for the first application we had, we did like 250,000 to 300,000 applications through and it had free form, no financial qualifier. Um, and clearly it worked, but this one is just a cleaner one that has a higher completion rate and uh also we introduced an financial qualifier. So, this is just what we're doing now, but clearly the other worked as well. So for this this is I was just laughing when I read this like the there's no punctuation things like goes to show don't have to be perfect but uh on my journey to get healthy come fit and toned I've already invested and the framing of this is obviously to show what they already have invested not some like make money online right we're in uh women's fitness so 40 to 60 so we're not asking like how much money they have to invest in themsel like all of that it's just the framing is weird so for this it's how much have they already invested in themselves now based on the data of what we've collected So far, quick numbers on this is this is about half the conversion rate of these. Okay, so call this 5%. Like app to uh close or technically booking to close through app, but uh these are like 10. All right, and this is five. Just quick, we're just going to use those numbers. So saying that, now what do you want to do with these less than one case? They still close, but way less. So the goal is to get as many of these as possible. Now what are we going to do with that? So we have conditional formatting on the back. And there are people who do this like crazy lead scoring and goes across all the different questions and if they're in these buckets, push them to these pockets. Like this is just what we do very simply in two directions. And then I'm going to show you how we like ninja automate it. So it just keeps calendars booked no matter what. Um but for us what we have on the back end is the uh conditional routing. So right now because we have so many bookings and like so many quality bookings directly coming through um we actually sorry that's bright. Um we have it set fully to DQ. So, a DQ full page for us is this. It's basically like, "Hey, Mandy," which is our AI, is going to reach out to you uh with a couple more questions, but in the meantime, buy this low ticket. Okay? So, just trying to push them into here. And this cleans up sales like all day, every day. So, just this ugly page. We're completely rebuilding this. And this is what March 2025. So, this is going to go live uh in like another week. We're going to completely rebuild this. Um but they will get DQed fully if this is toggled. Okay. The other option is to just run them through to a DQ booking page that's identical to the other booking page with a booking except this booking widget is going to be a completely different one. So we don't have setters. We now do and we're like rolling that out this week but this whole time we haven't. So what we technically have is on the back end we have two calendarlys. You have the master that has the high quality bookings getting to it basically only and then you have this which is the DQ one. So we'll do routing or availability um priorities for the sales reps based on that. So like your top one will have all of your top closers in it and then in order and then it'll have the bottom one which is the DQ one all of your like second and then uh down to your worst closers in current state or new onboarding for example. So that's how we currently run it when we have this on. Right now we have so many bookings that are coming in as quality because marketing is crushing it that we have this fully off. Now, where this all came from, what I'm about to show you is when you have like just enough or you're scaling your sales team but like not enough and you're kind of in that like waffling in between phase where you can't fully book out with only your quality bookings. All right, so quick math on this. Let's say you have 200 applications coming through a day and based on your data over the last week, you know that on average 50 of those bookings are quality are the 1k plus people and use whatever your example is for yours. Of those 100 then that are coming through is 50/50. Okay, a 100 of them are quality 55% app to booking rate. So you only get 55 bookings a day, but you need to fill 100 100 for your calendar to be full. for example, how are you going to let these ones through from the bottom barrel just enough to fill the calendars? Because sales reps thrive on back to back, right? Because you're going to have no shows, you're going to have all that. You have enough of those strung in a row, you get strung up in a row, you get like completely out of flow and the sales percent overall sales per booking goes down. Like it's best to be busy even if it's a little bit lower quality. And again, we're trying everything to make it so and everyone is as quality. And again, the 1% still close or the less than 1K still closed, just at a lower percentage. All right, so How we built this out is this right here. So essentially, if this field hidden field that we're just calling spots is less than 61, okay, route them to the next steps. Okay, so if it's less than 61, route them there. And it's and it's equal to this. If it's above 60, so right, it kind of just I think it's whatever. It's just because it wouldn't do greater than or equal to 60 then and equal to this, then route them to the DQ page. So you fundamentally think what that is saying, it's saying if the spots, that's this hidden field that's buried in this application spots right here. Right now it's 53. So if it says it's 53, that means it's going to route them all to DQ because it's less than. If it was over 53 or I mean sorry, if it was over 60, it would open them up to the DQ booking page. Okay, so difference there. Why we do this and how we do this. So back to this, I made another video on this on how to have a spot tracker. So, this is how many open spots are on your sales team calendar like into the future. So, today being the 23rd. All right, this one's not live now, but as an example, so 85 open spots are for today and 116 are for tomorrow. Not good because let's say you have uhund or you only have like 50 on bookings on day. It's like you still have a massive amount of calls to fill. So you want that toggle to have as many as possible. But then when you start to get full and you're at a hundred over here, you only want to let the ones squeeze through that are quality because you're trying to fill it with as much quality and you almost want the DQ ones to just back fill. Okay? Or just basically get it to the wa get the water up to the line of where yes, you know, you're going to be able to fill with quality now only is kind of more of the methodology. So, how I have this set up is inside the job form, we're going to have a hidden field that's here that is just going to be called spots. And the reason we do that is because when the form does its conditional logic, you want it to be able to route based on something that occurred in the application. So, people do this with UTMs all the time. Um, you can easily do this like I shared right here with normal routing just directly. It's like if it's this, it's this. If it's this, it's this. But I needed dynamically changing based on how much open spot availability we had. All right. So what I did is if we have every hour it's going to take today's date, reformat that date, and then it's going to look up tomorrow's amount of open spots and based on this or this, it's going to then set that predefined value inside the jot form. So, it's going to go in, it's going to push in, it's going to edit the form itself and change the default value of this, the default value to 53. All right. To right now, it would set it to 116. Okay? So, it's going to find tomorrow's amount and if it's whatever number, it's going to push it in there. And then you can choose based on where your throttle is based on what you know. Okay? So, might be a little confusing, but let me try and rephrase it. So, if tomorrow has 50 spots available, that means that it's currently 8:00 p.m., so it only has 50 spots available tomorrow. We know based on our numbers that we're going to be able to get that many bookings by then. Okay? So, we know that we're going to be able to get 50 bookings to fill in of quality, right? So, we're going to toggle it off. Now, if we have 116 like it was, that's like, oh man, that's too many bookings. We're not going to be able to fill people's calendars. They're going to have open spots. They're going to have no shows that are going to fit between. People are going to have two hours in the middle of the day where they have nothing to do as a sales rep. So, what we're going to do is we're going to let all of them through. We're going to let all the DQ ones and all the main ones run. And it's going to continue to run until we have enough bookings. Then, it's going to toggle itself automatically instead of having a VA or you or someone in there actively managing it to change that. So, like right now, we use 60 because we can generate so many. uh for a while we had it at 40. So only when there was 40 available so we would have more DQ bookings on the calendar until it trained. Now, level two of this, and I can I can't show these because you have like API keys and stuff in them, but just is every hour find the date, find tomorrow's date, look it up in that sheet, find the open spot number, and push the open spot number as a default value into this so that that number is live updating every hour and submitted with every jot. And then when it finally hits the threshold and it's submitted, it'll route it. Okay? So, people do crazy lead scoring that we don't do. that's like if they answer this one and this one and this one. We passed our stuff off to a data scientist on like 250,000 applications and all like 15,000 customers and all this stuff and they found like nothing. And for us it was like if they're obese already and again women's fitness 40 60 if they're already obese and if they tried macronutrients which is like part of our methodology and they tried macronutri macronutrients in the past and they didn't work for them. If either of those two it was like lower but again that was on the old app. This is before GPT cuz now we fed it in our new CMO who's a rockstar. Shout out news. Uh he found all this information and found like a bunch of pockets of stuff that are really cool that the data scientist that we paid dumb amount of money didn't do or didn't find. So we may be tweaking this, but this is just kind of like the technical part of the routing. The other piece of this that's super important is the DQ page. This for the booking right now still goes to our closers. Okay, it just goes to the the lower bucket of closers. very easily. You can just swap this out and go to your setters, which is the next plan for us after we get to the point of uh using the setters on the other lanes that are coming through and missing opportunity. So, this will go through setters and a couple other places will. But where I want to go is the big piece of this page is it does not fire anything on Facebook. Okay? So, it does not fire the pixels, Google or Facebook or Meta more so. All right? And why that's huge is because for us, you're going to have the lead event, you're going to have the submit application, the uh schedule, and the purchase. All native events. All right? And this is 6 months old or so for us because we used custom conversions and all stuff for a while. The DQs, the 1K sub, even if you're letting them through, do not fire the pixel on server or browser. So, it's not on page and it doesn't do that. And then because it's another widget, so whether you're using Hyros or UTM or like any of these, you can just set it. So these bookings do not count towards a pixel. All right? So if you have 200 applications that come, we don't even fire an application because this would be a submit app technically. So you're going to have every lead firing, call it 1,000 leads, you're going to get 200 applications. It' be higher, but you know what I mean. 200 applications. Half of those, let's call them DQ, are going to land on this page. Now, the other hundred are quality bookings and are going to land on the actual quality booking page that has the better uh closers on it. Those are going to fire submit applications. The DQ ones are not. Then the bookings that come through the main are going to fire schedules. The DQ ones are not. All right? So, we're only feeding back to Facebook the ones that are double the conversion rate. Okay? And that is just the goal of that. and we haven't like fully shaken it out yet, but the goal of that is to make the submit app, the schedule, as well as obviously the purchase. The purchase is the highest, but it's such a long cycle that we're trying to optimize earlier in the funnel and this is how we're trying to do it. So, that's the gist on like the routing. Uh, again, we've had crazy looks at this and different models and stuff built out on the application data and this is what we using so far. We may go back and I'll update you on that on how we do and same thing with the setters. setters are going to squeeze this and make it like super super helpful. Um, but this is just how we do automatic routing to make sure the calendars are always full by keeping it dynamic so that you can allow bookings but maybe to a lower quality bucket or you can allow bookings but you don't uh cook the pixel on the bad people or on the lower quality people. And yeah, so comment below what you want me to talk about because I have a million one things on a sheet that I can just riff on like this like any day. Um, but yeah, something that'll be valuable to you guys. And then yeah, chat on Instagram and subscribe, comment on here so I can get some more ideas. And I'll talk to you guys soon.
