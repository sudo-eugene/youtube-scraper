# Breaking Down My Q3 Plan Step by Step! | EP119
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdFf3vIr4vE

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about Q3 goals for business and personal. I'm be walking through cash collected, cash profit goals, marketing, sales, fulfillment, tech, finance, and ops. The different goals we have in projects and KPIs for these departments, and then personal. I have my work section, which is kind of what I define this. And then my personal personal. All right. So, we're going to walk through how we got these and what they actually are. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 79, almost 80 million actually now in total cash collected. I just didn't update this. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talents, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool [ __ ] All right. So, for Q3, um, so just FYI, right now where we're at, uh, we did three last month and right now we are ripping, uh, because we're doing some renewal special, but I'll talk about that. So, quick numbers on this. Uh, we're going to say, let me pull up the exacts just so I have it. So for like a health standard 12 and then the true target here is that 30%. Okay. So if we can get to 12 which is basically 4 million a month across this quarter uh that would be a big win for what the direction we want to go uh while also saying you know a little bit conservative if we start hammering it um and leave some room for some error. This 30% number again we are kind of like dancing this funky line where like 30% is ideal. it can be higher depending on how we do this, depending on what portion of what offer and suite it comes from. Um, but if it's just asis and CPA stays where it stays and whatever, this is like healthy for us. So, that's where we're at with that. Now, I would like it to be higher as we scale higher in these numbers and more, you know, contribution overhead hits and overhead stays roughly the same. Um, that would be good. But, let's get into the marketing side. So, marketing and efficiency of people are the two biggest biggest things here in my opinion are what are going to make or break these numbers. So for marketing the targets around these uh we have a CPA target. I'm not going to get into the breakdown of like all of these through here. Um but CPA target we have now set uh pretty aggressively for what we're targeting. Uh we would we haven't hit this number in a little over a year on like month- over-month basis. Um but we are trending down on this. So like this looks good which is then a function also then gets rorowaz. So for us we track new rorowaz. So essentially new cash that is collected from new clients within the first 30 days against uh ad spend on that month. So we have a target in here uh that we're going to hit buyer funnel. Uh what I mean by this is essentially a low ticket funnel. So something that we are selling a product so either low or mid-tunnel that we have cracked that can sell xyz amount a day that is enough a day that it can fuel the right like the percentage. So let's say you're getting a 3% ascension rate right from your low ticket to your back end or from your buyer funnel to your back end. Uh so in that if you're selling 100 units a day, you have a 3% ascension rate. On average, you're roughly getting three units a day over x amount of time frame um from those purchasers. So for us, if you want to sell 10 units or 30 units or 50 units of the backend a day, you have to do serious volume on this buyer funnel. Um so that's why we also have these lead funnels, which is what we've run all this through. Um and essentially, you know, majority of the back-end purchasers have come from lead funnel. So I'm saying leadunnel, but that's a VSSL opt-in funnel. That's a DTA funnel. Tons of stuff in here that I could break down that I talk about in a lot of other videos. Um, but yeah, so essentially having a core buyer funnel that crushes and having a core lead funnel that beats the control that we've done, you know, a majority of our revenue through at this time. Cost per live call. We're optimizing around this now as well because this is a function of show rate as well as cost per call, right? Um, so right now we have XYZ cost per call. That's pretty in alignment, but then we have a show rate issue that makes it so it's cost per live call. So I'm just trying to make it so marketing has a specific stat. So cost per live call is a function of that. So we now have a target in there that they have uh daily tracking uh weekly, month- overmonth, everything tracking where they're trying to hit a specific number by changing these things. And also there 50/50 funnel split. The goal is again now to get this ramped up more so that we are no longer spending a ton into lead funnels and a little into buyer. We want to get to a point where we're kind of more diversified between buyer funnels and lead funnels. Into sales world, that live call close rate is the number one thing. Um we have some new sales management there. We are shifting up kind of the teams a little bit but we have a setter and closer division. Um fully flushed now. Um so show rate is a big thing which is a function really of setters uh more than anything as well as I mean really it's marketing. Um but it's then a function of setters because they live in that in between land as well as obviously all they do with the self-sets and the portion of the buyer funnel because they take all the buyerunnel calls on the ascension. They take the self sets, meaning they do the classic set where they go through the CRM. They do dials and they get them from, you know, app no books and churned and uh uh cancel no shows, all of that. And then they also do ad confirmation. So they will confirm the calls after they're booked in which is a very big very very big function of show rate. They have a new unit count which basically backs us into these numbers. Uh realistic number honestly um for us. So new unit on there reoffer cadence. is basically the new management is focused on the pipeline. So, we do just so much volume and all we've done is volume for a very long time. We're getting now more into like focusing on the leads you're given more so than just more more volume, which is always going to be a new person on my calendar. And so, building in like a reoffer cadence, this is a big one, a big initiative for Q3 for sales that will basically align with getting more people from the pipeline into closed units. In fulfillment, we are focusing on offer stack live. So, we have a bunch of stuff and I've talked about on here, but different things for front-end larger purchases, different things for this buyer um funnel, what we're going to offer there, and then also some backend things. So, that plays right into post purch post purchase ascension and what those rates are and just the overall flow of having it in place. First things first, need this offer stack live, then we can do that. Um, evergreen renewal rate, we already have a system in place for this, but optimizing it. So we essentially have like retention reps um that sit on the back of the annual program and are now evergreen placed to have conversations and renew them. Um but this can be fine-tuned. The offer stack has already changed a little bit for this. Um so focusing in on here to make sure that this rate is XYZ high and then that the blended number is uh you know in KPI that we want. Fulfillment software we're changing the entire fulfillment software that sits uh on the back for all clients. So for our X thousands of clients uh we are moving to the software that they sit on. uh we are using like a enterprise legacy app that it's just time to get off of. We were going to build one in house and it just did not seem like the move. So instead we are going to get on one renewal sale. It's actually actively live right now and it is cruising. We're at like 300 grand today. Um which is great. And we've been at like 300 grand. We did what 290 260 and 300. So it's cruising. So good month ahead right now. Um based on renewals and again those are extremely high margin. So for us we just renewal sale. It's only a little bit off of our normal renewal, but we like jam it into a week, which does hurt this evergreen one, by the way, because then obviously they don't have as many at bats. Um, but it's really really good for the company, really good for the morale overall and like cultlike vibes and, uh, it works well for us. Um, employer hiring. So, we're going to move in a direction of like getting off the job boards and not hiring from there. We want to do like employerled hiring. So more company brand face or brand style stuff that will get us basically like you know look everything's a funnel I would say but like getting us focused on having inflow that comes in for who we are as an employer not just from all the pages or from all the places because generally speaking that's like a volume game and pretty low quality so we want to just start to attract it this way. We do a really good job of that in marketing and sales um but not necessarily as much promotion and stuff around that for the coaching and fulfillment kind of side of the company. So, we want to start pushing there. And then backend offer count. This is for this evergreen renewal portion. We now have like a downell continuity thing. So, we have an a count of active members that we want to focus on having in here by the end of Q3. So, hopefully all this is making sense. I mean, I I feel like you guys probably need some context from other videos, but I feel like a lot of you are just the same people who watch them all. So, it's you and me that we're talking to around here. Tech side, we want to move to a payment orchestration. What do they call it? pavement orchestration platform a pop. Uh we want to get to a point where we have that. So we store subscriptions and all these other things. We're talking about doing some version of a custom. There's a lot of tools out there. There's the whatever paddle and charge and sticky and whatever. So we will eventually move to one of these. With that on or under that comes this source of truth. So we need to sunset our past data set and how we're kind of using it which is basically multiple sources. Um it does play well together and like we could scale pretty heavily on it. I'm under the belief of that. Um but we are moving to a centralized source of truth starting with starting with the fulfillment stack. Um so like basically on the back end of this this will be all the activity monitoring but this will be all the actual data data data. So we did this pretty well with uh sales and marketing right now. It could be cleaner for sure. Um because we still use like a sheet for some of the stuff for like core data sources. Um so we're going to move that all into a custom data lake and have our own setup there and then all of that to jump down to here. Reporting system we'll pull from there. So we're going to have one standardized data source and we're going to have one standardized reporting tool. Uh right now we'll use kind of like interchangeably, you know, a viewer that can come from a sheet, a viewer that's on Looker, a viewer that's in HubSpot report. So we're going to standardize the data and we're going to standardize the reporting system. Uh we're also going to move setters and closers to different phone systems. We're looking at a bunch of them right now. Um but you know, something really good for closers that has a higher response rate, you know, probably one of the blue systems. Um setters, we likely are going to do one that's like a mass dialer version so they can optimize around the selfsets. Um but yeah, and then maybe on top of each other there because right now we're all inside one tool that just does what it needs to do for phone but doesn't really do what it needs to do for either of these and like efficiency wise and then automation system essentially we have run on zaps forever. We do like millions and millions of zaps. So we are moving things off. We're going direct with APIs. We're going direct with some of the source of truth stuff so you won't need as many automations. Uh and then we are moving a ton of stuff over to NADN uh as well and then likely probably some other tool will be around that we'll have things on over time. Um, but that's kind of the overall goal of tech right now. Finance and ops, managerial reporting kind of pulls finance and ops pieced together, but I want some better reporting and things that are basically like department level P&Ls. I I I already have them, but I want them in like a behavior, a change of behavior direction, so like it actually reads to people in the right way, not just numbers on a screen. Um, like that actually makes sense and they can make decisions based on it. So, I'm going to change up some of this project manager. I'm finally integrating somebody that can basically sit in next to me and implement all of the projects, follow through on them, uh follow up on them, have the right people in place, the this happens and this happens. The difference between a onetime project, a recurring project, and all the time project, right? Like these different things. Um so this person starts this next week. So I have a 30 6090 set, but we'll run through the uh what is that? Quarter three. Um department KPIs, department cadence, and department targets. essentially getting their cadence down for what they're doing meetings right now standardizing them so they're all around a similar style of agenda they have their own KPIs but all tracked in the same way that then flow up to the master and then department targets so basically taking these things and pieces that come from here and then breaking them down to the smaller projects all of these kind of play into one but right now I'm under the belief that we have such great people but we just don't have efficiencies of team because this part is messy so we are going to straighten the ship and all row the same direction and all targets and KPIs and everything tied together through one source of truth, one direct target and then breakdowns from there. So that's kind of the general what we're doing for info coaching. Mainco um these are the targets and these are the projects. So hopefully that part was helpful. Personal wise work uh of my personal is basically what I'm calling like anything I'm doing in info coaching land that is outside of Mainco. So phase two, this is in the queue and this is already happening um but I'm not talking about it yet publicly but phase two. So, I have a bunch of stuff around here that's like, again, all full breakdown, but I have a big target here and a big thing that's happening here. Um, YouTube and X to fuel that. I think I'm coming up on So, today's 119. I think I'm going to go to 120 and then change over to two or three a week instead. Um, right now I'm just like a cog in a machine that I created and I'm just like in it, in it, in it. And I want to be able to zoom out and like look at everything, especially as this piece kind of phases up or uh scales up and this is continuing to crush. Like I have a lot of other things that are not listed on here that are kind of like bigger picture. this is like how to run the machine and how we're trying to do it. But then there's things that are in addition to that that kind of like break the frame and I just want to be able to focus and actually do it. And right now without having the right structure and everything around these, like this can be a major time suck for me on certain days. And like it gets me extremely frustrated and like a lot of jazz. Like it's it's 900 p.m. or it's 8:47 p.m. And like I'm doing this because I had an interview that was supposed to happen earlier today and then there was like a scheduling conflict. So it got bumped to next week and it's like now I have to make a video today just because I told myself I would. And I told myself I would for 30 days and I've been telling myself I would. But I'm at day 119 and like it's I've gotten a there's a lot of feedback from it and good result, but I think it's just kind of time to slow down on the cadence. I think quality will also go up so I can continue to do things that are valuable and share valuable things. Um and then overall I think my peace of mind and life would be better. So drop some comments if you're okay with two. Drop a two. Drop a two. Um two trips. I put that under work because um I want to do two work style trips. So basically I'm doing one this weekend but you know essentially go hang out with a bunch of info coaching online people. Um it's super valuable for me for two days forward it whatever the you know quick little trips are network with a bunch of people and get out. It's a change of the frame change of the scenery change of all that and I like it uh when I get to do it but only for short amounts of time or then I go crazy because I want to be back here. XYZ distributions that's just numbers tied to this and other things. Um, I have, you know, I don't want to put things on here like that, but like I have personal targets of what numbers that we will then pull from this and other things that will come in as distributions. So, whatever that number is, I have a number that I'm targeting. And then personal personal daily up at five. I need to get back to this. I was on this for months of this, four months, for at least two months of that. Um, and then just fell off the wagon on it and like just don't feel like as jazzed and uppidity again. I feel like I'm kind of like a cog in a machine right now. So, I'm trying to refocus on that. find things that are like big funs to solve. Like that's my thing when I get into routine and it's just maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Like it just feels monotonous and I like I hate it. So I need to solve for this and this is when I'm excited generally. Um or I have to. And like right now I don't have to and I'm not really that excited. So like I want to start with the excited or force the have to. But it's a little more fun the other way around. So 100 mile run. Um, I just did a 10K over the weekend or on Friday and like I'm not built for that right now, which is very interesting to me cuz I've run a marathon before which again I didn't train for and was not properly but like I just was not in the shape that I thought I was going to be in for it and like my freaking legs hurt and all this. So need to get back in cadence of this. So I just threw 100 miles on here which is basically three miles a couple days a week. Um, so simple simple goal but just like get on your feet, get out there and do it. Daily gym. This is like a non-negotiable. It's kind of what I mean why I'm not built for this. I'm like very, you know, I don't want to say topheavy, but I'm, you know, I I lift a lot and I don't do a lot of cardio, so I sit at this desk or I go to the gym quick. So, balance those out a little bit more. Daily food. I've been all over the place with this. Going out a ton, doing all that, which is fine. But again, I just kind of like when you're stacking those all together, like I don't perform the best way. I don't look as what I want. So, like focus on that. Have a move plan in place. This is rolling into fall um by the end of this, right? You got July, August, September. So, by the end of September, I want a full-fledged plan for what I'm going to do for Q4 for a move because I will not live in the cold again. Uh, executive assistant, personal coach. So, personal coach is like a sure shot. I already have one right now. I see him. I meet with him every two weeks. He's like a business performance productivity coach. He's actually on that like Rolodex sheet. I don't even know if it's on here. Yeah, he's on here. This personal A1 vendor. Um, he's a boss. He's an absolute legend. He works with a ton of like lead genen guys, affiliate guys, and a bunch of people there. That's how I met him. Um, but basically just hold the cadence there. And then this executive assistant one. Um, I don't know, but I feel like that's something I feel like I wouldn't be burning out on some of these things as easily or like feeling like how I'm feeling if I had someone who did all the messages for me and like scheduled meetings because I'm fine with the time. I'm happy to do the videos. I'm happy to do this and that. I just haven't like zoomed out of the machine to be like, how do I automate this or how do I build this or this to make it so these are just like easy for me to do because I still do all the boards. I do all the communication. I book the calls. if there's a cancellation, I got to like redo it and like all that kind of stuff that I could probably just solve with this for like five grand a month, 10 grand, whatever it is. So, I think this will happen. This one's kind of like a wishy-washy. And then I have a bunch of other personal stuff that's like family and friends and girlfriend and things, but I'm not going to put those on here because I don't need to talk about those if I don't want to. So, I have some other cool goals around there where I want to make sure I have a little bit of a cadence around there at least uh for a bit of this last four months. I have not focused on that portion and it kind of sucked because I kind of burned some stuff there and trying to rebuild in a couple ways. So with all of it, right, just relationship burn that happens when you don't have touch points or stay close. So that's that. Hopefully this was helpful for you guys. See how I look at this and see what kind of mine are for where my small place in this online world or world in general extremely small place and what I'm trying to focus on right now. So hopefully helpful links survey doc I just looked and I haven't updated this since 84 links in back to the executive assistant thing. So I'm missing like 20 on here or whatever that is like almost 40 on here. So sorry about that. But these are all the OG videos tech marketing sales ops. I might even go in and over the next era in phase two of things come through and relaunch and redo some of these in like a big fashion that's like way deep dives. And then Rolodex. Again, these are just people that I either have worked with or I trust deeply to do some of these things for marketing, sales, processing, whatever. So, you just go to Rolodex and you will find it. All right. I appreciate you guys. Hopefully, this one was helpful for you. Um hopefully, yeah, it was good. So, message on X. Instagram is best for actually for messaging. Um, and then yeah, talk to you guys
