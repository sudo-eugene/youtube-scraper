# $7M in 92 Days... here's my "boring" strategy | EP97
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jN-YRaF9g

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing our boring strategy that made us $7 million in the last 92 days. We're going to walk through the three different marketing funnels we have and how they connect and the stats behind them. We're then going to walk through the three different sales sections we have, how those connect and the stats behind them, and then the three different fulfillment stacks we have and how those connect and the stats behind them. All right, I'm going to keep this very simple, but go into a lot of detail. All right, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed 76 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what didn't work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company, opportunities, and networking with cool people building cool All right, so first things first, Stripe screenshot to verify this through yesterday. So you can obviously see an uptrend here. We we'll have these down ticks uh on weekends and a lot of just I mean randomly honestly. Um but yeah, we're hovering around, you know, call it 100 to 150k a day over in these ranges back here. So, the three different funnels we have, I'm going to walk you through the actual flow of it, and then we'll get into the stats. So, the three main funnels we have are going to be a VSSL opt-in funnel, a direct application funnel, and a low ticket ascension funnel. Okay. So, for VSSL opt-in funnel, it's going to be your classic send uh Facebook or I'm sorry, meta or Google traffic to an opt-in page, and they're going to give us their name and email, and then watch uh to get a free training. The free training is going to be a VSSL page that has just the video on it. Um, and then the uh application, the click to the CTA on it is going to wait until in the VSSL when uh the call to action is in the actual video. Okay. So then it's going to pop up. There's a ton of emails and a ton of stuff around the back of this. I have other videos on the channel you can watch. You know, today's day 96 I think in a row of making these videos. I have a ton of videos that go in depth of automations and SMS and all these other crazy things. Um, but just for this uh quick overview, they will then go to an application. on the application there is a financial qualifier inside there that will route them either to the main booking page or the disqualified booking page. Okay, there's technically a disqualified bridge page and that is if the calendars are full. Okay, so on here if let's say we have zero availability for tomorrow and someone is DQed, they're going to get sent to this bridge page that will push them to this other funnel which I'll go into soon. Um but a majority of the time um you know most of the traffic is going to be qualified go here. Some of the traffic that's not is still going to be allowed to book. It's just going to go to um either ramping reps or uh lower quality reps. Okay. Um and then we do that just to cook the pixels and keep everything right there, right? So, they're going to book into here and then they're going to land on a success page where they're then going to talk to a closer and then be sold and, you know, purchase, get their terms, all that kind of stuff. Okay? So, that is going to be funnel number one. Now, the reason there are two right here is because we actually have two that are performing really well for us right now. We have our original funnel that we've done, you know, 71 or two million directly through. And then we have this other one um that has a different opt-in page in a different VSSL for a different messaging pocket. Okay? So, um you know, imagine something like um one of these, you know, drop ship guys, for example, like they have one that is around XYZ messaging and then one is around the other, but they're selling the same thing, right? It's the same product uh that they're selling over the phone. Um but they have different messaging funnels. Like one is about um branded drop ship, for example, and one is about uh US supply. Okay, let's just say this is as an example. So, different messaging pockets that have different uh language and messaging for these. Okay, now to go a little deeper into that, we actually have three more that are in the queue. This is our best funnel that we've had. The reason this is the best funnel for us is because we do so much around consumption and this has a lot of intent uh intention points versus something like this next funnel right here that I'll go into. But for us, this has worked really, really well for us because we have so much that exists within the email automations and campaign blast and content that exists for middle and bottom of funnel. Okay? So, we will email them non-stop, send them to the website. They exist in the flywheel of content or I'm sorry, a web of content that they will, you know, watch this one, then this one, then this one. Um, so that has worked really, really well for us. All right. Now, on the next funnel, we're going to have DTA. So, for us, DTA is direct to application. Some people call this direct to VSSL. Um, but for DTA, you're going to send the traffic directly to a page that's going to have a headline, a VSSL, and an application right on page. Some people delay this, um, which is pretty common, and then other people just make it instantly available. Either way, generally speaking, it is going to be a lower cost per app, lower as per uh uh lower cost per call um because it is easier and there's less friction, okay? Because you're sending them direct to this page and they can essentially just like instantly do it. Now, because of that, you'll have less consumption and you'll also have more people that bounce to that you can never other than just retarget to them because you didn't capture their email. The first capture point you have is the application. Okay? They're going to go through the same router and then go through the same back of funnel, okay? Where they can book uh either DQ or main or get bridged out uh if there is no availability on the calendars, which is actually pretty rare for us because we have so many reps and so much availability. Um and then this last one here is going to be our low ticket ascension funnel. So, this is going to be direct traffic to a front-end sales page. So, it's going to be a long form sales page where they basically put in name and email to start the checkout process. This is going to be a low ticket, something that's under $100. They're then going to land on the checkout page. Once they land on the checkout page, it's the full, you know, purchase. They will purchase and then the big difference here from a lot of people what they do with low ticket and why I'm calling it, you know, ascension more so is because as soon as they purchase, they get pushed to um book an onboarding call. So it's basically onboarding, quick start, implementation, whatever you want to call it. They will then book into this and get on with a setter. Okay. So we have run this in the past where they go direct to closers and it has been very messy where a closer has you know this someone with this framing and expectation that lands here versus someone with this that's you know booking an implementation or quick start or whatever. Um so we did layer in a setter in between and this has been crushing for us. Okay. So they will directly book in with a setter. Uh and I'll go through the stats on all of these in a minute. Then once they're on the setter, they'll get set with a closer, all the uh intentions there, the framing, the qualification, everything. And then they get on with the closer and close. Okay. We do also have this uh page right here, which is postbooking. They will get asked to submit a questionnaire. It is not required. And uh we do see that people who fill that out have a higher likelihood of them being set or closed. Um but again, that's just kind of like an optional piece. So those are the three core funnels and that's how they connect. Now again, we have multiple variations of this and just as like a kind of future pacing. So over the last 92, right, what we've done is essentially lean into both of these because we were running just one main on here. We've optimized this out where we had three different ones that we were testing. We've now landed on one that's like mainly working for us. And then this has like 92 different split tests and variations. It's constantly up and down for us. And we're actually trying to solve for this in a very different way. Um where we're trying to make it more cold friendly so we can run this at mass scale. um versus right now call it I don't want to give exact numbers but call it you know 50 call it 100 whatever units a day and we're looking for something we can sell hundreds of units a day on okay so right now all of these get traffic all of these get spend and then they all work interchangeable and what our CMO calls the VVS the value vortex system okay now stats on this just quick I'm just going to pop over here because I have all my stats up over here um but we're going to say on across this range we had around 75,000 leads, call it. Uh we had around 20,000 applications that come through all of these different buckets. And then we had um around 12,000 calls, 11,000 12,000 calls. Okay, we'll just use that as a number. So from that, again, consumption is going to be biggest here. And if I pop out, I have a funnel economics sheet that kind of breaks all these down. But the app to call percentage, so is going to or how do I let me back up a little bit. So for the opt-ins of these people that are going to come to here, we have a pretty high rate actually that go from lead to application. This one is direct application. So obviously there's no data for this one and this one kind of doesn't count for that. Um but we have a pretty high like multiple tens percentage that go from lead to app. And on this we're optimizing for schedule and purchase. It's kind of like a throttling between the two. Um on this same thing and on this it's just optimizing for the purchase. And as they flow through here, we've seen that like a very very high percentage of people are touching multiple points of these. Okay? So they will come into here, then they will exist in this system, be getting a ton of email, see an ad, and then get into this one and then route into these. And then same with this. This will kind of pick up people. Um the almost issue with this that we've had thus far is that uh almost all, not almost all, but like call it 50% of the purchases that'll come through here are already existing in our CRM. Um we have years and years and years of people in the CRM. So it's not to say it was like you know yesterday they saw this and then they purchased this. Um there are some of those but a lot of them are people who have existed in the system haven't bought something from us and then book into these. Okay so getting into this next portion setters. So setters will have auto confirmed and self set. Okay these also have different commission tranches for those of you that operate. Um but essentially an auto set is going to be considered one of these calls. Okay. So where we are automatically putting a booking on their calendar. These are 15-minute Zoom calls that we'll set with them. Okay, so that's an auto set. A confirmed set is basically them claiming these. Okay, so the ones that come direct through marketing or what basically everything that's not a set um that is auto on their calendar or a self-s set is going to be considered a confirm set. So a lot of people call these marketing bookings. Um they're technically everything bookings. Um but those are what exist here and they will call and they'll call within whatever 3 minutes. They will confirm, hey, you know, this is XYZ time zone, you know, is a Zoom call, you know, XYZ, all these different things. Okay. Um, so that's the confirm set, which is essentially just like a triage or confirmation. And then a self set is going to be everything that exists where there's a phone number. So let for a simple example, application not booked. So somebody that falls off in here. So they apply but they don't book, which on average for us is call it 40% of the applications on day. So if we got 100 applications, 60 of them are going to book on their own and 40% are going to fall through the cracks. And that is one of bucket one, let's say, that the selfset's going to hit. We also have them from this phase that apply that do DTA but don't book. Then from there you're going to have I mean there's like 90 different versions of these but then you're going to have people who don't show for the call. You're going to have people who don't show for the set call. You're going to have people who purchase the low ticket but don't book into this call. You're going to call that 30 40% that don't book on this. So same thing if you have 100 people that purchase the low ticket. You're going to have 60 or 70 that'll book um if you're crushing it and then you're going to have you know 30 40 that fall through the cracks. So all of these are going to have automations that exist, but they're also going to be layered in with setters. So we have AI bots that message in between these um and then also push them back to the setters. So that is kind of setter land, right? Um and I'm trying to think if there's any other direct buckets, but it's basically that and then pushing backwards. We also have something on booking page that has it. So if there's no times on the calendar that works for the person, they can submit a form uh of when the when when a good time for them is and the uh setters get those and they will reach out to those and those are considered self sets as well. All right. Now closers closers are just going to exist over here. I almost built this out to be like massive and show you the different things, but essentially uh calls are all going to come into the CRM as call scheduled and then there's, you know, nine different ways that they can go. So, they can either be a no-show, a cancel, um a complete DQ, like there's just no way. Um closed one, closed lost, hot listing, uh long/midterm, uh nurture. So, there's a bunch of different things that exist within here, but the closers are just working their pipeline. They're getting full booked. We just now changed this on around here, as you can see, like a the downturn. Um we changed it over to be 45minute booking slots, and this whole time it's been 30 forever. So, a lot of just 30 back to back to back to back to back. But the issue is a majority of the closes exist outside of that 30 minute range. Um, so we're trying to optimize for making the calls long enough but also understanding that show rate is a real thing and having backto-back calls where there's no shows uh off like just you know breaks the frame and breaks the role there. Um so retention I kind of want to come back to this as it exists for these fulfillment. Um but a retention exists over here you know right? So that is after they've already gone through the program and product um and when there's inflection and main points they will then uh you know retain them or uh or get them into the next year or multiple years. Okay. So fulfillment stack so info and community and I have a whole chart on this. I'm going to make an entire video of how I view fulfillment or product offerings. Um everything from onetoone with the expert all the way down to the very bottom which is essentially just info just as it is without a community. um and how the different value stacks, how you can charge different prices. Um but for us right now in this stack that you're seeing here, info plus community is going to exist right here. So this is going to be a sub $100 product that they get info. Okay? So they're getting login access to something. They're learning XYZ thing, one specific like module or many multi uh many modules that back out of essentially the coaching. And for us, we're going to sell that for sub $100 and then they also get access to a group. Okay. So for us, we do our Facebook groups in uh I'm sorry, we do our groups in Facebook. A lot of people use school, whatever. Our demo is majority or SC or circle or some of these other ones. Um our demo is majority on Facebook uh just for who they are. So we keep the group on there. So that'll exist there. Onetoone coaching is this main offering. So everything that we're going to sell on this initial sales call is only onetoone coaching. We have one offering, multiple pay plans, uh financing, sure, all that kind of stuff. Um but it is one offer. Okay? And the reason I say less margin is in comparison to group coaching. Uh, and I have again I have other videos where I break this down, but on the initial stack for when you're selling this, you have you have to think about what goes into the cost to fulfill this as well as the cost to, you know, acquire a customer. So the acquisition piece, you're going to have your marketing spend, you're going to have your sales commissions, you're going to have setter commissions, you're going to have management, you're going to have all those different pieces that exist there. You're going to have your entire ad spend bucket plus marketing department bucket. Um, and again, you can kind of pick where you choose where these sit on the P&L if these are supposed to be lower or above. But directly to acquire a customer, you need to pay a sales rep, a setter, you need to uh pay your ad spend, and then you need to pay for the fulfillment of this. So, you're going to pay a coach. And in a onetoone setting, it is likely going to cost you more than it is going to cost in a group setting because one coach can only work with X amount of people. So, you're going to take that coach's salary or amount or whatever, and then however many clients they have across the year, and that's going to be your per unit cost that it's going to cost you to fulfill on this. Okay? So we are going to have less margin on this just because of that stack and where all the real money is made is going to be in this retention portion. All right. So retention is going to exist for us is something we are constantly um or just newly but now going to be constantly adjusting um to where we can refine this because we had a leaky bucket for a long time. Um we really should have focused on this earlier and we didn't. Um and in doing so we let a lot of money slip through the cracks where we paid a lot to acquire a customer. We got them in we got them results. we fulfilled on the contract which was the year but we didn't frame it in a way that then was this is a continuation this is a forever thing um and they should get another year of coaching or we didn't have any other offerings okay so that was the thing that we just offer we just rolled out so beginning of this month we rolled out a group coaching style thing that's essentially you come in you join in onetoone coaching right so you have onetoone coaching that is the personalization that is everything you need to get you from you know basically existing in no man's land to being on structure and getting in you know in xyz result. Um, but then after that one year, your offerings that you now can get through the retention team is essentially keep staying onetoone coaching either with your current coach or a different coach. So stay on that one to one or we now have you can go multiple years for a discounted per year rate. So if you want to go, okay, cool. I want another three years, two years, whatever, you can do that at a discounted rate. So pushes the cash forward, locks them in for multiple years, which is great because honestly a lot of these women uh in our demo and our target like they do need to be in for multiple years in order to kind of like fully sustain and set in. Um and just have the personalization, the accountability, the onetoone that piece. Okay. Now, if it is too big of a, you know, cash burden or whatever, um but they still want to stay for the community, a bit of personalization, the access to the app, the all those things, we didn't have an offering for that. Okay. So now we've rolled out group coaching that allows us to have um less cost per to pay a coach, right? Because they're going to have multiple there's no one to one, right? So there's no direct messaging, there's no onetoone calls, there's none of that piece. So the fulfillment is lesser um but the person still gets access to all of those things they want to stay for. So they get access to the community, they get access to the app, they get access to the workout, they get access to all these different pieces um for a lower cost. So for us is actually half the cost. So let's say this is 10,000, this is actually 5,000, right? So it's half the cost uh for the year. And we also have monthly options, different pay plans. Now, I think this is going to crush for us. And it is really framed as like the lifer program. Like you're just in this for life. Um because you get to stay and get all access to that. And you also get the group coaching aspect. So when you do need help um you can come into here and still get the personalization. It's just in a group setting instead of getting on onetoone. All right. So that's kind of the stack for us. Um and the um the stats kind of behind that. I'm going to do like a full video where I go through like all the literal nitty- nitty-gritty. Um, but I have I I pulled them up over here just to kind of give you some like rough ones off the rip. So for the Let's go up back up to the top. So for us, uh, what is really good here, let's start with setters. Um, on setters on here. So the different buckets of auto set. So auto set is our highest stats. So auto stats will have 80 to 90% show rates, which is like crazy in our world. Um, so 80 to 90% show rates once they get to the closer. So once they exist between here and here, we'll have an 80 to 90% show rate and call it a 22 25% live call close. So the economics on this crush, the issue for us right now is solving for getting this cost per purchase lower. Okay? Because of how it's framed and because how it's set up, it's not cold friendly. So it is not um producing at the rates that we want it or uh or we're not getting the net CPA that we want uh on this. So we can't scale into it. Okay. Okay, so that is something that exists right here as an issue, but all of the stats on this are fantastic. Okay, so the current bottleneck on this is solving for here. Okay, so that's what we're working on now. Um, there's also other things on here that we're solving for that kind of feed into this a little. Um, but if we were to isolate this, that's that one right there. Okay, now confirm sets. These ones are landing at around a 75% which is amazing. So 75% show rate and a very solid live call close. And now the thing for us here is the percentage of confirmed books. Okay? So like let's say you have 100 bookings on day for us in current state only half of them roughly will be confirmed. So while these ones have a fantastic show rate, the ones that don't confirm um either need to be set as free and then they can get double booked on the calendar uh or they need to be reached out to multiple times. But it's an issue that we're having where the solve for this right now is trying to get a higher percentage of the bookings confirmed because once they are confirmed um then the stats right here are amazing. Okay. So bottleneck on this one is getting more confirmed. Self set interestingly enough this is the lowest show rate we have. So this is people they're hitting that are in this uh app notebook or some of these other zones and buckets. Um and for us it's just um you're basically getting more bookings for the same amount of spend. Right? So you do obviously then layer in the cost of having a setter. But this is your dial 100 get, you know, five pickups, set one, whatever math. Um, and this is uh something we need to work on, right? We need better dials. So that the bottleneck on this one in current state is basically getting more uh more sets for the amount of leads that we have. So which is increasing the dial rate, which is better framing on the calls, which is, you know, better connection rate, all those things. So we're looking at different softwares and ways um that we can manage this team in a better way to get more sets that come from the setters um like directly the self sets. Okay, closers. Um this one we are optimizing for right now as the bottleneck on this right now is the live call close and that is an issue with where we're having missed opportunities. The call length wasn't good, the admin amount, the the follow-up time, the abil the even time to have the follow-up because of how packed their days were, all those kind of pieces. So that's why we just attempt where there's the attempt number one is to move them from 30 to 45 minute bookings. So that is you know proactive solve number one we're trying for this bottleneck and then retention. So retention team their bottleneck right now is mainly the frame in which people are getting onto these calls and the time of it. So for us this is new to us where we're trying to like force book these calls for retention. We're doing it 60 days before the end of the term and I think what we need to do is probably layer in more activation points. So, we're doing an entire like data overhaul that stores all this stuff and has like uh activation points or like peak points of like their happiness and their like success in the program so that we can, you know, basically reach out and have conversations with them on the peak moments. Um, but for us right now, the other piece of this is the framing that exists within the coaching and how they were sold uh is really on this one-year contract, one-year contract. Um and then multiple people have been sold on uh for like last year uh were sold into 24-month payment plans either through credit card through whatever different ways. Uh and that is massively hurting retention because they come up to the completion of you know the program set and because of how they chose to finance it or because of how it was pitched to finance it externally um they still have payments for the next year. So it's very very low low likelihood that they will retain. Um so we're doing different things here. We're also talking about doing different offerings that would make it so this makes more sense. Um, but yeah, so that's kind of the the pinches on these. Within marketing itself, we are testing multiple new VSSL opt-in funnels, and I think these are going to crush for us. We have different brand faces that we're going to be testing. This DTA is not getting really any love right now, but we're testing doing some like delayed button pops. Um, so there is forced consumption for call it 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever um before they are even able to apply. So seeing kind of where those stats shake out. Um, but this almost again acts as like a not purposeful but like retargeting asset. and so does this. So really, this is like the core core core. So that's why we're optimizing on these right now inside of fulfillment, the uh info coach, the info plus community. This is going to be likely rebuilt as a new product that we can have. It's not just framing it differently. It's going to be building out a completely new uh complete new product stack um that we can use for cold for low ticket. Um the one-on-one coaching is crushing for us. Uh they get crazy crazy results, which is like, you know, honestly the most important part. Um, but we just need to get the math to be a little bit dialed in a little better. And then this group coaching piece is brand new to us. So, fulfillment is new to us as well as kind of the offering. So, we're just navigating that. So, hopefully that was helpful. Um, I can go into other videos where I go like deep deep into the stats on like percents across these. Um, but I feel like I just gave you a lot of them. Um, but yeah, so this is what our focus is. This is how we did. And really the boring strategy is essentially just more of the same. So, we're just doing more of the same, just iteration, optimization, and more of the same. So get something that's at 10% and get it up to 14% and then do more volume. Um really is what this is. It's not a simple this is a simple business model. Um very simple business model. So it's kind of boring sometimes just to you know keep iterating the same stuff but that's the point, right? That's the point. So building it into a machine that's consistent that continues to build. So hopefully that was valuable for you guys. Today's day 95 or 96 I believe in a row of making these videos. Uh you can find them all at www.ryclog.comdoc. ryanclog.comdoc. I break them down tech, marketing, sales ops. In the beginning, I was very very heavy into like deep nitty-gritty of what we were doing, how we were doing it, um review everything from funnel setups to um sales uh sales comp trackers to how we even do the comp um stuff like that. So, there's a ton of detail uh in a lot of these videos. So, if you want to go binge, be happy to. So, all right. Um that's what I got today. So, hit me up on Instagram if you have any questions. Uh is the best place to find me. Uh, comment below. I love the comments. They're funny as sometimes. So, hit me up there and I will talk to you guys soon.
