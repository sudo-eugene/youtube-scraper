# We Fixed This Funnel in 5 Minutes (Watch This) | EP117
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxSsi04eHRY

What's up, guys? We are back. Day 117, I believe, which is crazy. 117 days in a row. And we've got Josh Low ticket Gavin. I like the name on here. And we're going to be doing live funnel reviews. So, Josh has a great network. I pull or I push it out as well. We get some submissions in on a form. People are going to submit AOVs, CPAs, low ticket, different types of funnels, and then we just live review them. Sometimes nice, sometimes a little what do you what do you call that? Soup's another one. I love the comments of the last one. Go watch the last one. There's some funny funnels. It wasn't mean. It's just kind of funny. Yeah. No, none of this is mean. Just FYI to everyone. This is like us just being candid about what we see, what we think. And like also sometimes ugly things work better than pretty things. But when it comes to the offer, it comes to the flow, comes to the economics, like that's pretty that's pretty science-based. So let's kick it off, brother. Man, I think I think I have this live on X. So hopefully this is live on. Yeah, it's live. 22 viewers. Yeah, we got 24 viewers. Shout out. You guys have links, DM them. One thing I know some of you guys watching this replay or on live or whatever, I know there's a lot of you guys you'd love for us to review your funnels and you're like, "But I Josh, I don't want you to share like the links or whatever." Um, hey, if you would rather us not share the links, be okay showing the design of the offer, feel free to send it to us privately and let us know. We'll try to get you in on a future episode if we do another one. And we'll try to keep it private. So, uh, we totally understand that as well. But we have a couple funnels in here, uh, that we'll go through. Uh, again, I asked for as much data as possible, Ryan. Some people don't give it. Some people don't know. I think we had someone sign a client and they don't even access everything yet. We're reviewing their stuff, so they don't even know, but we're going to do the best we can here. But, let me pull up and share my screen. Let me know you can see it. Oh, yeah. Again, I'm nicotine. caffeinate. Heck yeah. Get lit. I can't see anything. Let's get lit. Oh, shoot. Why can't I share? Wait, I might need to reset and rejoin low key. No. Yeah, it's so quit and restart. No. No. Come on. Share. Let's see. I'm sorry, guys. At this point, I have nothing else to say other than Josh. He's the best MC at these possible up until this moment and now he's not the best MC. What do you guys think about doing these live like this? Are you chat? You're good. What's up? Now your audio is all I'm good now. I got it. Don't you worry. Don't you worry about it. Live is a move. We can just cut it up. Clearly. Yeah. Yeah. Super good. The one time The one time exactly we go live is when there's like an edit. All right. Does it let you do it now? Let me I'm trying to get my mic shifted over here. Is that better? Check. Check. Check. That's fine. Yeah, it sounds okay. Sounds crispy. Yeah, it sounds not using the right mic. It's not using the right mic. What the freak, dude? Why is All right, we'll just get into it. Sorry, guys. This is bad mic. You have to suffer through it. All righty. Let me share my screen again and we'll get into this. We got some funnels to review today. Um, let's see. Maybe got some We got some health ones. Maybe we'll just have bisop. What do you think, Ryan? I wonder if we'll have we'll have some here. Let it rip. All right. Can you see my screen now? Yes, we're good. All right. Now we're cooking. Now we're cooking. All right. So, first one up here, we have um Delta Funnels. Okay, let's see what here. So, we have their ad library. Let's see if that works. Uh, nope, they did not show the right link. So, ad library is not working. We cannot see their ads, Ryan. But we are going to see their funnel. Um, what do we know about this funnel? They've spent $60 on ads, so it's very new. We're just going to give you overall advice. Um, you have your current CPA 80. So by one sale A OV 350 this is INR so it's not USD scale it scale it up and want to spend more 80 80 to 320 I don't even know what that is but just scale it how it is I want you to keep running it yeah I think it's just fine I don't know why you submitted it but let's do it it's doing great um this is a better funnel that we've seen some of these I like the check boxes I just like clicking on. You know, you need to Is that what those artists perform? Oh, yeah. They Yeah. Yeah. They don't They don't do anything. It's a Russell Brunson thing. He did it before a long time ago. H long time ago. Oh, man. They got proof for what he was on. Yeah. So, you got proof. Is it Is that compliant? I don't know. Not my problem. But, okay. So overall powerful system easily turns into highly paid UX UI designer gets paid 60 INR I think to one uh I don't know I really shouldn't I don't know that no experience needed no expensive courses no cheap clients ever okay this is we talked about the last one your guys' sub headlines need to be way more specific on what they're avoiding and don't just throw it out there and think it doesn't mean what you think to me the sub headline carries more weight than the main headline because you're showing them all the things that it's not and that's the biggest thing to stand out. And so people obsess over the headline. I obsess over the sub headline. So it's like no expensive courses. Now you just put them in a mindset of thinking about the times they bought expensive courses. They're about to buy a course and even though yours isn't expensive, they're now thinking negatively of like, oh, when I purchase education before, you see, Ryan. So it's like you got to think about what this does to people when they're going through it. And then you know the no experience needed that's fine like with I dude without saying without needing any experience dealing with clients who are headache or like clients who don't pay you know pay you enough for your work um you know without any startup costs. You can say something like that like instead of expensive courses be more specific on what it is they're avoiding and what makes this different without is it without sales calls? Can they do this without competing on job boards? Like what is really making uh it stick out? So I like that. The job job boards one. Yeah. Can you scroll through the page? I want to see. So like it looks like it's like a bundle of ebooks products based on that. So what will you do now? That's a little You know how I feel about design on stuff like that. I'd even it out. Make sure it's like have you should like Yeah. It's like the whole sultanic thing trying to make it simple, but it's almost the wrong It's almost the wrong way around, right? Where it's like Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like a result list, but yeah. Okay. Yes, I will become I don't know who the demo is or like but there's some grim like grammar or capitalization some simple stuff. Just very simple doesn't necessarily mean it's going to break it. Button don't have a moving button. It's annoying the freak out of me. It's going to annoy people. Only system you will ever need now. Um there's some stuff there that's a little just like only system you'll need to achieve outcome not now to get this thing you want. This is the only system you need to blah blah. And then obviously these are capitalized. It's called the 1% designer system is like the Yeah. ESP. Okay. What's the system? What's the button? Oh, it's a much longer page. Got it. Yes. We got Okay. I'm curious on mobile. I should look at mobile what this looks like. What were those examples? What happens with the system? You get messages where should I send the payment? That sounds like a good one. Yeah. No, that's good. That's I think that's what it means. Like you're saying if you buy this then you get these outcomes. Uh yeah, clients is I don't think you need to do this. I think you can just you just say like, hey, when you use this, you're going to, you know, have clients wanting to pay you. Uh you know, they're not going to like they don't they won't have to think about it. They're just going to want to get started right away. um clients wanting to, you know, hire you more than once. Um inbound client, you know, like selling outcomes better than just this because then you have to they're kind of doing the math or trying to instead of creating the imagination for them, you're making them try to imagine themselves, which is just I'd rather just tell them what's going to happen. Crazy, right? No, you don't want to make it like crazy, right? Assuming that they don't think it's crazy cuz then you're trying to like it feels too forced. It's like, dude, isn't that crazy? Like Ryan, dude, like is that so sick? It's like me asking for a compliment. I'm like baiting like trying to get Ryan to be like, "Ryan, isn't it cool that I've just crossed 2,000 subscribers and everyone watching this should go subscribe me so I can pass Ryan?" Dude, is that so cool? Ryan, it's like Ryan's just going to hang up because I'm poaching his audience and asking for a compliment. So, you see, you see, you don't want to do that just happened right there. So, go through this. What's the next one? Testimonial section. Testimonials and then just more and then No, no. So, there you go. Okay. So, there's the stack. Here we go. Now, we're getting some stack here. UI resource. I like the design. Like your mockups are nice. You want to go up. So what are Yeah. What are the core ones on this? Yeah. Right there. So I think this is the main entire playbook. So learn how to build them. Learn the secret to designing them. Okay. So it's UI chunks. The next one is there's the MA UX master guide. Okay. So you got UI plus UX. That's the core. And then it's ultimate Figma. I think it's so funny because I think people can like literally sell like you can't sell that on its own like UI mistakes and fixes or like the case study the case study template the one up there like the Figma playbook or whatever that was called Figma pack like you can sell those left and right so today only $2.99 now Ryan there's a big issue I wonder if you noticed this too with this offer and for everyone watching this you can think about this for yourself too maybe if you're making this mistake too but we see a lot of language on like getting clients now clients who want to pay you and this this and that, but I haven't seen the connection to how like I will get clients by purchasing the Figma mistakes or Figma pack or like I don't see the connection of how the learning how to design is going to get more clients. That could be the best design in the world and no one's going to pay me which is like designer's biggest issue. Yeah, it's a classic info coaching. It's like get clients then it's like productize and be better at your service and then it's like scale, right? So about getting if this is about getting clients, it has nothing to do with getting clients on page. So your stack is flawed. Uh this would be like get clients, get better at design so they want to pay you more, make you testimonials and like scale build a team to and outsource all the work. Like that's why I see the upsell flow. Did you talk about what the system is? That's a good question. It's the number one system though. It's the top. It's the only system you need. I know that 1% system. So right there. What is it? Okay. Okay. Here we go. Project. Stand out in interviews. Land high paying jobs. Recruiters saying you're hiring. Yeah, that's like kind of in the right direction, I feel like. But it's like implying like you have to get good at design before you can get hired. Shoot, I have to learn all this stuff and get good at design and then I'll get hired. It's like I would rather do like an MV I would do like an offer where it's like uh MVP portfolio or something like how to build a minimum viable portfolio that wows clients like super easy. It's like uh you know instant portfolio where it's like we're going to show you download. Yeah. Like white label our portfolio and templates that you can instantly wow creators but like I get and then how you fulfill it is you just subcontract us and then you just do it. Dude, people do that. People do that and crush with it. Yeah. So anyways, you explain the system more all the run more ads scale it up. Uh I think we're good on this Ryan. There's a lot that you know once you have more data it be better but so what is that is that top or is that a second page second page check out different I don't know what did it just do second page looks like yeah yeah so again more stuff on design we already signed a ton of design stuff it's like these people want clients dude like I know designers like my designers they love me cuz I've sent them a lot of deals but before that they were like competing trying to be really good designers and I know amazing designers There's like the amazing amazing photo designers who have no work because they just don't know how to put themselves out there and become better known. And that's like the biggest flaw. Like a lot of a lot of designers are going to be behind the scenes and designing and they're they're more introverted and really good at like just seeing stuff. They're not like the runaround man look at me blah blah blah blah. Like those are the copyriters. Um and so these people they need a way where they can be loud and become better known without like feeling like they're having to like do the dance. So I think if you made iteration order bump is not colors and type it's I'm flipping it. I'm literally going to take the if you're if I'm in their shoes I'm taking this whole offer. This is now an upsell one or two and I'm making the front end around what I said like MVP portfolio or mockup where it's like get clients like here's how to wow clients with a complete beginner with only like a simple portfolio and like you don't need to have a bunch of experience. You don't need results because I was like holy crap. Then if you can fulfill on that then great. But that's what I would do if I'm in your shoes. Yep. I do like the two steps. Usually if you go down on that little is that a down cell as a as a radio razor pay. Oh no, it's the addition. I you added the upsell. I was like I thought the one was one. Okay. And then what were his stats? He said they were like um reworking it. But yeah, he spent spent $60 which is like five. So any current CPA 60 to make 350 I mean yeah you can or 80 to make 350. I mean obviously something's working. I don't know what the upsell track is and I don't think you have links on them but keep running. It's like a rebuild for sure if you're going to do what Josh said. Um but I think it's probably more scalable and more realistic for your market to do what Josh said. So leaning into doing acquisition and how to make it easier to get good clients first. Then you can productize. You can do that. It's literally the classic info coaching stack. So yeah, especially like and then uh big thing is you're selling Indian market if they're selling to states other places. a big thing like talking to a lot of my uh team members who like one of my my really good team members fulfillment partners um is he's from India and one of the biggest things like mindset wise like feeling you're not good enough just you're not from a first world country which is not true at all and so one big thing is like mindset wise building their confidence and how to like reshame re reshape how they look at themselves which helps with converting clients so you can add that as a bump I would say in there so um Cool. Anything else, Ryan? No, no, no. What you got on these other ones? All right, so let's pull. Looks like we got ad library. Let's see if this is this the one we don't have any. Uh, is this Yeah. Yes. Yeah. This is not my offer. You probably know who they are. Yeah. Okay. Let's see here. This is not my offer. Women weight lo weight loss. Yeah, I know. I know nothing about that. So, yeah, I'll step it. I got you guys. Women over 45 classic. Okay. Dang, bro. Dang. This is me going. Wait, does this offer you probably know Andrew? I do know Andrew. I know the guy who had his offer. I'm pretty sure he I I don't know. I think he exited his offer. Uh but he sold it or like left it. Uh, I know. I don't know how much we can say, but I think he gave up a percentage of the company to somebody else. Got it. All right, let's check those pages. Looks like a free training or it looks like a VSSL funnel. All right, so we got landing page. Go to Now we're talking my speed. I think every single one we've done of these except one have been low ticket. It's because everyone just I'm posting it to everyone just low ticket follows like no low ticket. Okay. Um, let's look at the He also said, uh, emails. Can you write two or three short emails? Oh, and he's asking you to do that for him. Yeah, I can't write emails for you, bro. I'm not an email writer. AI is though. Just I just write all my emails. AI booking page. Can you look at our page? We'll book it and give some simple ideas. Okay. So, we don't know much about it. We're just going to give overview. Ryan, you're a big call booking guy. What do you think of this old? You remember the Sam Ovens funnel table, bro? That's what this is. That is Yeah. session happening soon. Is wait, so is it a is it a web? It is just in time web. Yeah, just in time. This offer did make decent money from what I know. Like enough to be able to like sell it or sell a percentage a majority of it. So it is a good set of your metabolism. Uh um yeah, I mean design-wise, yeah, this is OG. Again, ugly stuff works. So I'm not even going to comment on the design because it is what it is. But like what's what's the copy on there? There's weight loss release. It's a brand new that's compliant. That's smart. Weight release. That's sneaky. You're not losing weight. You're just releasing it. FTC finally re release weight for good. Without shakes, pills, powders, fat dieting, or intense exercise. So that's good. I mean, that's that's on brand. Um why focusing on weight? Can you scroll a little? Sorry, my face is in the way. Yeah. Oh, shoot. Focusing on weight loss and counting calories backfires while releasing weight becomes harder and harder with every diet. How intense calorie? Yeah, I mean it's solid. We worked with over 2200 people. 62. I hate when there's like again I'm not even to comment on the design because again sometimes ugly things work but like I like we have a page right now that I built which is ugly and I'm like not proud of it and it's outperforming everything right now and it's like just hurts my souls. It looks like this. Um okay. So and then it's what it's just reserve spot now. That's it. And then they then they go to calendar. This is crazy. OG, this is getting so many app on there. Uh, is it built into there? It must be after I figure time. Oh man. Giving away all your sauce right now. Yeah. Everyone email me. I can't wait to get emails. Everyone want my number too. Here you go. Call me too. I dare you. I have two. I have two though. This is better. Oh yeah, there you go. Okay, so honestly, someone trying to sell me something. Honestly, call me. I want him to get sold. I love cold emails. I love cold text. I opt into everything. What was he asking? What What are his questions about this? So, he's taking over the booking page. We don't know, dude. He probably as a client. So, I don't have access to any of your stuff. Give simple ideas to help more people actually book. So, the help people help more people actually book is going to exist on the webinar that we did not see. So, do you want to watch? No, I don't want to watch the webinar right now, but it's going to be on the webinar. So, depending on I mean, right, like to try and give some value here. Yeah. Like again, everything everything that's a funnel, everything in the funnel. So, you're going to have your ads, your cost per click, your whatever. We already saw your ads look, whatever. Relatively solid. We don't know the numbers on them, so you can't really give any feedback. They land on this page. What percentage of them then become, you know, webinar opt-ins? Then, how many of those people show up for it? So, what kind of email sequences exist? what kind of framing exists that makes it so they actually show for the thing that's in one minute or 30 minutes or whatever. Okay, optimize for that rate. Then once they're on there, what is the pe what is the conversion of people that actually are on the webinar live and or come from replay or whatever that then actually book a call. If that portion is what's broken and you think that these other ones are good because the economics or the whatever, then all you have to solve for is the webinar. Like very simply put, I know a ton of people right now that are cranking webinar to direct to cart. So I don't know what kind of offer stack you have on the back, but like if you can sell something that's 500, a,000, 2,000 basically caps out at 2,000 depending on how you're looking at it, but like thousand ones are cranking right now. Pay plan ones are cranking right now through that. And then having your onboarding call focused around ascension and pushing them to your high ticket coaching, like I've heard that is I mean I've seen that that is absolutely crushing. So I don't I have no information on where to help you with what you are trying to fix on this right now. What was the other question? Can you write emails for what? Booking. Can we write to get people to like book a call or like show up for the Is that what the first question actually was on there? Yeah. I think it was a email. Can you write two or three short emails that get people excited and curious to watch our free Yeah. So they're having an issue with getting people to show for it. It sounds like because who else would they be emailing unless they're cold emailing? So yeah, it sounds like you have multiple things right there. So framing to get them to actually want to show emails, reminders, all that stuff. You need to optimize the [ __ ] out of that to get them on the free training. And then once they're on the free training, it sounds like you also are having an issue of conversion rate to booking, which can either be offset and like you don't have to play the volume of booking games if you don't want to. Um, what was the range on the booking widget? Was it two days or was it looked I feel like it was further, but I don't remember. Uh, you want to rebook again? No, just go back. You don't have to rebook. I leak my information again. No, you don't have to opt. Oh, I mean guess you can opt in. You're going to get all the email opting page. Oh, yeah. Sorry. [Laughter] Okay, here we go. This is a mess. Um, that's too far. That's way too far. So, you don't have same day available. I don't know what time zone, but you don't have same day and you're going out four days. Your show rates are probably no bueno as well. So, couple little plugs here and I bet it just flips on its head and works fine. Yep. And then other thing too, best time to run a webinar is not on like right now we just do it where it's 8:00 PM EST. Uh, and we run it every day. So it's always on it's on demand or it's like just in time, but it's a set time. It's not just like one minute. So that gives time to prepare. They're done working. They can sit at home. They can watch it. So split test times as well because it's like, dude, what if I'm busy? It's like one minute. So like it started like in one minute or something like that. Yeah. What does the next one do? probably see. Let me reset it and see if it resets the third like it's kind of it's it's like a VSSL. You might as well just go right to like when you made direct application at that point. Like you're pretty much just doing it. I don't know. I haven't run these in a very long time. We ran this in 201 19 I think that we had something like this that existed and I was part of the team fully and we were running this. It was a 497 auto web and there was no ascension. There was no nothing. It was literally just like existed on the site and we would get like two three units a day and we were like, "Oh, I wonder if we should run paid to this." Um, that's awesome. And then we brought to a call. So, I don't know. I mean, there's not enough context to really like be able to directly help, but yep. All right. Um, so this next one here, what's the other problem? So, they just said, uh, just for the front of now, super new offer, only spent 320 on ads to really say got 13 sales out of which nine were tests. So for so for the four cell it's about four. [Laughter] Yeah, let's not count the test purchases and the total sale count. Um all right, so we have four sales 320 or is it out of these four? I think one or two are people are past customers. That's okay on past customers depending on what your flow is. That happens all the time. like our low ticket for example like we'll do 50% of them are existing leads in the CRM because we have a massive CRM over years of data. So when it wants when we launched our low ticket um I like pages like this honestly a lot. Um but yeah so that it having past customers purchase is not really an issue unless the only thing you're going to sell them is into the thing that they already own then that's an issue. So, like for us in the like when I'm saying they already exist in the CRM, they're not past purchasers. They're past leads that are coming through that we paid for through the VSSL opt-in funnel, the direct application funnel, a month later, two years later, they come back, they buy the low ticket thing, and it's like they're reintroduction, and they go from lead to buyer, which is like a good thing. And then you transition them, they're generally warmer, they already have the consumption, they already have that stuff. So, like that's a good thing. It's just like just know that those are different stats and the cost per purchase on those is much different than it is on straight up cold traffic. So, you haven't scaled anywhere near high enough to get out of your pocket of warm. So, your stats right now are going to be buffered and look different than they're going to look when you're scaled into cold. So, um haven't started working on this offer yet. This is so funny. So, these guys are all just like guys who are landing these offers and haven't run them. Yes, sir. We got a lot of You guys want your funnel reviewed? We'll leave the audit. You should leave the link in the your description below if you want to do more. If you guys want to be featured, might have it below. Um so personal development three days one powerful shift rewrite. So it's like mindset biggest thing is like you're earning oh you're earning power so it's like money it's related to money. You're out here crushing goals. Okay. There's voice in your head. So it's like mindset. Here's what Lawrence used to sound like. How does the intro still sound more hustle shifting way you see yourself? So I immediately I'm like this mechanism isn't like irrational enough or like unique enough where it's like going to stand out a ton. I don't know Ryan. Like I I just feel like I've heard I know I'm in the market but like first of all like just rewiring the voice and running the show like I'll be the perfect one. Yeah, I was on with Luke earlier and he was like, "You'll get this book." And it was like along the lines of this, right? And it was like talking about like reframing and how that's all or rewiring and how that always matters and constantly coming back to baseline. So like there is obviously the market that hits it. I just don't know if the wording around this. So like what was the first one? Sorry. The voice that got you here. Okay. The power over pressure. Own it. See it. Own it. Shift it. And then the identity is a strategy. Um, I think you can do a little better with like USP language within there. Um, when you install the system, I hate GHL popups. Next identity match your goal. Dude, I don't I don't like, but again, uh, ugly things convert. Ugly things convert. So, um, all right. And then, so if you go to the top, stupid simple thing, but the, uh, video player, not a vibe. So, if you refresh that page, Oh yeah. I don't know if you can even track what your view rate is on whatever that is. Looks like Vimeo, but don't So get on V V Turb, get on Vidalytics, get on Wistia, get on something that has that like video autoplay. Stupid simple thing, but like just increases your play rate to like 95%. Like people are on page for a reason. Has the text already showing on page, which I like that you're doing that. You're already out here crushing goals. You're already out here doing this, this, this. Like if that video is good enough, it can do the whole it can do the whole selling process for you. like you don't like people just zoom through the page. Let's make it a good conversation that you're having in your own head. Like I like the idea of it. I mean crazy. You know what this is missing? This is missing a narrative or um I think yeah it's like I think about I'll use Iman Godzi's example cuz he I feel like he's like the king of or his team or whoever's doing it these days. Really good narratives and like themes. I know Allan Sultan called like a theme where it's like this overarching theme that carries throughout the whole funnel. So like Iman, he'll take like his same thing and he'll like care like the same product but he has a new theme with it. It's remote revolution or it's like the one thing and a great reset like this theme that's going through and it's like it's so like catchy a theme and an angle where it doesn't he doesn't talk about the mechanism but the theme kind of carries it well with personal development. Look at Tony Robbins. All his events have these themes like the something something event. It's like this big grand theme and it's like the theme sells it why it should show up and sells the outcome without talking too much of the mechanism. So with personal development I think having a theme and a narrative is big. Uh and so like one of the themes we're coming up with one of our offers is like the tipping point. And so it's like oh I'm not going to go detail what that is but you have a theme that's going to carry through with that. And we're not going to even talk too much about the mechanism on the front end, but we're selling like this narrative on the front end. So, I think you just need to get more clear on what your theme is like Tony Robbins. And then he had not really any stats on it. Yeah, I mean test sales. Um, we got a bet. We I don't know if we you said earlier it's like people probably don't want to share their links. So, like it's kind of hard to do this other than if we just pull other people's links, but if we pull other people's links, we also don't have the data. So, it's like I don't proper way for us to get data to like actually help these public if people aren't going to share. Oh, there we go. 5 to 7K spent. Yeah, we got one to five. $1,700 new client small. Thank you. Spoke it into existence. Thank you. That page for teaching me. All right. Um, are you serious about scaling your e-commerce brand? That looks like a career need content now. All right. All right. So, what's going on here? You're looking to grow with high performance uh high performing ad creative. You know what's you know what's kind of immediately comes out to me is like I had no idea this was like targeting an e-commerce owner. Me either. That's what I said. I thought I thought it was like career based. I thought it was likely an Upwork ad. Oh, nothing about this implies it's to a brand. It doesn't even show a Shopify logo. It doesn't show a dashboard. It doesn't show anything that signals like something that a Shopify person would relate to. So immediately an issue because like you want to, you know, we're at the event in Dallas and Eddie uh shared how like some of their best ads are when like the real estate professionals film in their environment that their freaking customers are in. So like in front of the home, for the garage, or I have a friend who does a fitness and he does corporate America. So he always films in front of like a random corporate building where like the people are working. Like it connects to them. So immediately your creatives are just nothing creative. Uh uh send blue they always do the funniest ones right now they're crushing and then more in this in our world Robvi his ads like Ravi Abu Abalo yeah I have him oh he's coming on the pod next week by the way he's coming on next one first interviews back on your page the other day um but all to say he has an ad that's static and it's a screenshot of the Hyros dashboard and it's just showing the uh initial source and it just says is YouTube and it's like his it's his back office of them getting all high ticket clients coming from first source click um YouTube organic and like only if you know do you know so like I'm not in physical e-commerce but like triple whale for example or like like I don't know what exists in the back show you like what content shows that it got a 5x return or whatever but like using the Ravi example if you had something like that where like an e-commerce person saw it and was like oh that came from organ I don't even know what you're trying to sell you're trying to sell high performing ad creative so just like rorowaz as like literally having dashboards that show rorowaz and like that are specific in triple whale or in hyros or in whatever. Yeah. So like you know even having like this is a random person looked up but even this like it shows like some examples of UGC and like rorowass CPM things are calling out to who they are. Um yeah like these people like there's a lot of people they run they'll show like examples of creator creatives too. It's like UGGC ads will do video stuff. So you're competing against this like thing competing against this. Learn how to turn product photos into winning ad creatives in minutes. Never pay for designers again. Yeah. So your ads need to and your offer needs to compete with this. Yeah, I see those all the time. That right there where it's like after before AI after AI the UGC ones where it shows like a canvas of like multiple UGC's like one core product and then shows like you know eight different faces on there. I don't know what the actual offer is. Do they have the land around there? This one? No. No. In the in the Oh, yeah. We can get to that. Yeah, we can get I just want to see what they're actually selling to see if we can back into it. Yep. $250 booked call $17,000. Like it looks techy now. It goes from being like it looks like it's software. Yeah, it's 500 software. is like I book a call and I'm like e I'm out like that though is right direction right this should be your creatives bro like why aren't you showing my numbers on the creatives like this should be your ad bro 100% I would get more interested on that yeah agreed agreed agreed multiple format hooks what is that like gas I don't know why this is so satisfying I'm just going to Dang. I love how those sites like this. I'd never like put much love in his sights. That's crazy. I love it. Um, yeah. I mean, I like the page. I like the page. I definitely definitely look software. I'm going to be honest, but like that doesn't necessarily need to be creatives. Why aren't these real results? I mean, those don't have row like if you can get triple whale screenshots moving and grooving on like what actual like layer those in the front. What is ads? Um, what did you even Sorry, I cut you off. I just want to go ads. Does it say? Okay, so free. This dasher makes me feel like AI wrote this, but uh, elevate your strategy. Elevate your ad strategy. I don't really think that's what they say. Like I think this with a AI. Yeah, I I think you did too. Nor do those creatives connect to that software lander. It doesn't. Also, here's the thing, Ryan. If you're selling creatives, you kind of have to have really good creatives. Like I know when I sell to like marketers, like if I'm selling to other marketers, I have so much pressure that my ads need to like be so like sometimes what convinces them is just the fact they have a really unique ad or like something impresses them like, "Huh, that's good." So you need creators that like are going to wow these people to show that you're legit. Whereas this, it's like, are they just going to make me craft GBT generated images? Um, so I don't know. I think your page looks great. I'm more so like on the ad side. Um, this is better. Like meme style, these work really well for us. Yeah. Um, so at least that's better, you know. Even that even if it was that with the the crazy behavior. That's crazy behavior. But like overlay even those like ad types though. But if the whole thing is like that is not at all that there you go. That is that is more similar to the actual website, right? where it's like branding, where it's like call outs, where it's bright colors. Look at Yeah, that's that's I don't know, Brad, but I would literally like my images would just say it's free. If you're doing a free thing, I would just say like free ad like I would just show like what if you get creators look like this for free and then show your creators like I don't know like it's your thing a free offer. So it shouldn't be super easy hook and copy. I don't think you need AI to write write this stuff for you. It's pretty like that that theme and branding of that video ad except there's no testimonials or like case study or like anything in there which is very interesting to me. So like you have them all on the website. I don't know why you're not using them. I also do like the graphic that's on the side. Again, it also doesn't matter like cuz ugly graphics work, pretty graphics work. Like different ads that could be the nicest looking ad like doesn't necessarily work, but like having that that's more in alignment and then what happens when they click to the page? It goes over to that page right there and then there's a book a call. Yeah. So they clear the page. It goes to this page and then it's book a call. Start with our scale system and it's get started. Is that compliant? I don't think so. But whatever. The other thing I do is I compliant in my life. But you can say imply scarcity without for$1 to20 million Shopify brands. Like that's amazing. I don't know why they're not using that. also small thing and you're not going to change your whole company, but that like BMW/BBWM thing is like kind of confusing and it kind of looks like BMW ads, but just saying. Um, and then he's had he said $1,700 cost per client, which is like solid. I mean, you can get that down obviously, but for $250 calls, which means a $250 call with a $1,700, it's a 15% sales per booking. So, you're making 2x on the front. you're you're in the LTV business, so you know, keeping someone for 10 months. I don't know what your retainers are, but pretty solid. And 15% sales for booking is interesting because it's not like a high ticket call funnel. Um, so yeah, it's all different. Yeah. So, I don't know because that means, you know, for us in our math, that's like a 50% show rate and a 30% live call close. 15%, right? Because it's those blended. Yep. So, it should definitely be higher than that. But $250 call booked for someone who's likely a pretty large client depending on what they're seeing on site. I think your AOV I mean your AOV is different than your LTV, but it doesn't sound like it's bad. So some tweaks on creative to get that cost per call to 150 bucks or whatever and then dialing in the sales process. I don't know what your offer is too where you're getting an AOV for 35 3500 but you're saying it's free for 30 days. I don't know if that's like postpurchase but kind of sounds like there's a little bit of stuff in the economics that you can tweak. Yeah. Um, crazy thumbnail here. My buddy, we we put together offer my local agency buddy here in uh in Minnesota free ad creative. And this is just like the hook that's working super well. So, I'll play it just a text so you guys can read it and see it. But it's it's just like this. That'd be good. Oh, yeah. So, it goes claim. There you go. Testimonial. Oh, shoot. Who's that? Who's that? So yeah, that that's great that I mean like testimonial. You have all these testimonials. Hit them with testimonials. Then explain a little bit more like see like here why it's like hey we're looking you know this they'll shoot at it. Here's your offer blah blah blah. I won't do all that. Luckily he's local. I wouldn't share that if he was mass market. But you can you know rip something like that uh and just do that for your offer. That'd be sick. So, anything else on that? No, no, I think that's a good one. It's a cool I mean I like the I like the business. I just don't know. Again, the whole hard part about doing these is it's kind of constantly shifting, dude. You don't have enough information to like because they could be crushing it. There could be like one metric that's broken or like one part part of the flow that's broken that you're like, "Oh, duh. If you change this, holy shoot, his $250 call, is that like actual calls?" Like if he made it a two-step opt in to that if he did it as a case study demo versus direct to book a call which is isn't even book a call. It's a form fill that has a ton of questions and then you have to then refill to likely then book a call. And it's like could you make it less friction? Could you add more consumption with something that's like a case study VSSL walkthrough? Could you could you could you like I don't I don't have data but yeah. So if you guys want if we were doing these again we'll leave a form below. Give us more data. Uh if you want things to be private, let us know. Um but if you obviously there's a lot of lessons here you can take away from it. You probably maybe saw something we mentioned in this and you're like oh frick I didn't my creatives aren't calling on my audience or suit my offer on the front end. I'm talking about getting clients but has nothing to do with getting like whatever it may be. Think about some of those things that you may have in your funnel and try some new split tests and put it to use. Some little nuggets you can put out there and increase your conversions potentially. Raw. What else is fun and up? Or should we just pop? I mean, I've heard some cool stuff like some stories like some I won't like just cool things are working. We talk about that. What cool things are working? Webinars to $250 products. Really? Yeah. Live two automated daily in. Yeah, it's like later in the day. It's like a few hours later. Um, and they're doing female market $250. Nothing else on the back end. 2.5 return spending 5k a day right now. Last I heard. Um, not going to say who or what market cuz no, it's a publisher. It's off publisher. Shot off publishing. Took somebody from zero. Literally, this is a nobody. Made them into somebody on cold traffic and then also helped with organic now. And so they took the model. It took like a nobody and did that and they started with like mini chat ads to ever webinar and they were just running that and it's a female market which is huge. It's a unique kind of mechanism as well which I think helps like the fact it's a female market not competition allows them to compete in those economics. So their cost per lead is very low. So my thought is now I'm looking like what is a marketer who's not out of competition that I can publish somebody who's a female and do a $250 product and run that autobi because like dude the fulfillment it's just like a $250 product there's no fulfillment costs the it just runs it obviously you hear that oh what a dream business I don't have to do anything of course there be issues that come later but like dude that's that's pretty crazy I did not think that auto web could work and $250 the economics it only worked because our cost per lead was like it's like $2 or something. Yeah. So, I thought that was pretty interesting. I thought that was really interesting. I heard one today that someone spending mid four figures and is doing like a four to 5x on a front end of supplements right now. It's like bringing back that game. So, bundles and doing all that, it's like a distraction me and us. Like just does not make sense for us to do right now. Like, oh, and this and this and this. And then like supplements have fulfillment. When would I focus? I have a whole new approach that we have decided on that we're going into. So we're going to do ours that's going to be we're start we're going to start back end. So it's going to be post purchase of the coaching. We're going to start there just because I don't want to f I don't want to try and sell direct to cart and then try and bridge and whatever. Like right now it's like how do we make more LTV for the current entry flow. It's like we're optimizing entry flows. We have multiple different acquisition models. we have XYZ. Let's get the cost per purchase to X through those. Once we have those up and cranking, want to crack a cold one specific, a cold uh buyer funnel, so like a low ticket and then a lead cold that's like proper uh because we currently have our main and then we have multiple of those, multiple brand faces, blah blah blah, distribution or uh diversification. Then going to layer in doing the other pieces of supplements, things like that. And there's some other things that we're talking about doing. But then I think that once we have it hammered out and we can do the fulfillment of those things well because I don't trust that we're going to be able to like right off the rip just like rip it on direct response ads and fulfill on it in two seconds. Like I think that's going to be a lot more difficult than I just want to distract. So we're going to wait until I don't know a month six million a month or something right now. adding adding in that next level like the supplements then what would that take you to 10 with those in addition yeah likely yeah that makes sense that makes I mean because supplements are only it's way lower ticket right it's just like the MR game so like at that time will we be in the direction of 10 yes are we actually going to just like flip a switch and then go from five or six to 10 no but in like a in a 90 to 180 yeah I would assume so like Yeah, we're doing that. I mean, we're at 800 on the month. Let's say the 7th. So, seventh and we had three days of like we had three days of non-existent because of the holiday. Yeah, dude. Okay, let's talk about that. Why? You should have done a video on this. Did you do a video on You did? All right. I don't watch I said holidays. I said holidays ruin call funnels. Here's how to fix it. Okay, you're running out of idea. I don't watch YouTube. I'm fasting for so I don't know what you're posting. But with your Yeah, I'm fasting. It's I'm just doing I have a goal. It's like I want to hit this and then I'll get YouTube. But once then you'll eat again. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm only drinking protein shakes until I get my YouTube back. But the call like holidays, did you guys try to deflect at all? Like do you ever do like or like Christmas? What do you thinking ahead? We're coming towards Thanksgiving, Christmas. How is your company like prepared for that in the past? You learn any lessons? Kind of thinking ahead here because we're getting we're getting close to it. What? Reframe. Reframe. It's summer, right? We're enjoying summer. Things are great right now. We're going to enjoy summer and all these info people are going to get out. All a sudden, frick. We're Q4. Thanksgiving's coming up. Then we got Christmas. Call funnels are like historically annoying. Then so thinking ahead, just help people start thinking ahead here. Like what can we start preparing for? Call funnels are just a different beast. It's like you either choose to burn the cash or you choose to burn the opportunity cost. And it's like one of the two because people are going to buy in those days. It's like the same way that if you have like outside of work hours call availability like there are people that work during the day and can never take a call and buy from you because the only way they can buy thing is over the phone and they can't do it during the workday. So like they have to have it outside of that. So there's very similar where like we always laugh cuz like Super Bowl for example, you will have extremely low like show rates, live call, close once that like kicks off, but literal kicks off. Um but during that you have all the you know 40 to 60 year old women that sit there and they'll opt in and you have like crazy good rates in terms of like ad clicks or scrolling. So the direct toart stuff so I've heard crushes during these kind of times when people are just on their phone. Like there's not really a time and a holiday and whatever where people are like off their phones nowadays. No. So, you know, so it's not like it's like the market doesn't shut down. So, ecom guys crush it in those zones. We're in fitness. Fitness is notoriously not good in Q4 unless you have a complete framing thing around like the anti of what's going on, but then supposedly we get it all back when we hit Q1 because you get the January stuff which is like window before people fall off. So, like our entire goal is to make things evergreen. But my video was basically around like how can you create revenue, you know, stealing Iman's framing or phrase, but like revenue generating events. Like he does revenue generating events, which you guys I know you do. Like you have Yeah. So we do Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and we do uh Christmas in July basically. We don't actually call it that, but like same thing. It's like a six month apart range. Started today. Oh, gonna be a nice little month. Yeah, started today. So we'll only do ours. So uh this one right here is internal only. So meaning renewals only. So we do a massive push internal. We do internal contests. We do uh we have pointbased system for sales reps that incentivize them to work on holidays. Because when you're doing the call funnel, you have two you have twofold. You have so I'm talking more on like a let's use fourth of July example. So when you have that you have your team that doesn't want to work. So you have availability that goes like this. And then you have the client base or the potential clients that don't want to book a call across this range because they're on a boat or they're going here, they're going there. So it's like you have both of those playing against you and you have a 50k a day ad budget humming daily filling your calendars and then you have a three-day lull. So it's like what happens now? It's like you leave it, you cut a little or you cut a ton and it's like you try and go to like 10k days and you turn off all your like performing [ __ ] and then all of a sudden you have to try and ramp it back up when a day in, three days in on the last day and then try and fill calendars for Monday where you have 300 open spots and over the weekend you have 80 open spots. So it's like generally speaking looking at the math it kind of makes most sense to continue to spend into it. Cut the waste, cut the testing, cut the whatever is like not working. So, like don't just full bore it, but like continue on. Um, and like this isn't 100% my realm, but like we had a conversation about this and that's exactly what we decided to do. We made some like pretty normal cuts on stuff that was like not directly performing or that was kind of sitting in creative testing. The other thing with CallFunnels is the time from lead to call, time from lead to close. So, like you're still spending it. It's not like it's going to like a page that just can't accept payment. They just potentially are landing on a page to book a call and it's not there a not then available. So making sure you use the data properly so you get all the leads, you get all the apps and making sure that you're emailing them or your setters are hitting them or whatever's happening so that they can be optimiz can make it into the bookings just like not on those days. So we'll do that kind of like the front end portion. We incentivize sales reps to work by giving them 1.5x points. So we have a pointbased system for our like bonus pools. So they get 1.5x for weekends and holidays and we'll like aggressively kind of amp into that so that they want to work there and hit bonus it want to work those hours and hit bonuses. And then the other one is yeah those revenue generating events for July. Ours is just internal. So we'll just hammer it home that it's like you get a second year or two more years or whatever at a discounted rate. We do it once uh we do it for a week and that's it. And it's just like submit a form, book a call if you want to talk about financing or whatever, but just like or click here and just charge my card on file, fill out an order form directly. It's like big big like today we have Yeah. Insane. That's awesome. Incentives. Incentives. Incentives in either direction because you got it's just like and we're not a specials company at all. Like if anything, our pricing just continues to go up. Even our special this year is the highest it's ever been because our even our special pricing continues to rise. So, it's like we aren't, you know, the cheapos uh in the market by any means, but we're also not like top tier, most expensive, whatever, no specials ever, whatever. We we try and leverage both. So, we did try and change the framing on low ticket to be like Fourth of July special and then just leave the same percentage off and like it kind of got some there was like some effect, but like instantly kind of turned it off. So when you in you talk about incentivizing the sales team whatever I always wonder how do you incentivize like CMOs or the marketers like for like our entire blended one is on CPA. So CPA. Yeah. So it's like a blended metric. So it doesn't exist like in a in like a vacuum of that event for example but like we have blended numbers. So you're talking about like overall marketing like Yeah. Like on your low ticket like I'm thinking about like with a set of eyes. We're just working. We might change this. This is actually a great point, but we might change this, but like right now ours is based on the high ticket CPA, which is a function of the low ticket CPA. So if you get the economics right on the low ticket, it is the lowest CPA you'll have for your backend. And so like we use blended stats for all of that. So as long as the CPA is like in pocket there, so say you have a $120 net CPA and you have a 5% ascension rate, that's a $2,400 CPA. Let's say get they get that net CPA to 80 bucks. that drops it to a $1,700 CPA. I'm sorry, $1,600 CPA and it's like boom. Now you can have tranches where you have like different bonuses and whatever where the CPA and it's paired with volume. I think that works really well. Um what about would you ever do CK just on the front? Well, I guess it's same, but it's not because if they hammered the front like yeah, you want the back, but like it's the the true all-encompassing number is how much does marketing generate? How much? Yeah. At what cost? or next division which is like the other pain though honestly is CPA is a function of sales reps too because if they aren't closing or if they have a 15% close rate the freak how the freak do your marketer he's just like he doesn't the sales team and like make sure it's like just stay and everything Jeremy Haynes said at some level it's like you want to treat sales reps almost like cashiers and like he said like you know like you want them to be just collecting payments so like what do you have to do on the marketing front to get it so the economics work where someone shows up to the call in general so like what's the framing? Right now, one of our biggest issues is show rate and like that's a marketing thing. It happens before they cancel before a sales rep can even reach them. That is not a sales rep's fault. They can hit them as many times as possible. It's like it's not. So, having the back-end sales systems, as Jeremy Hayn says, in place so that you're that's why I was telling him this morning, I was like, if we just optimize around cost per live call, not cost per call, cost per live call, which then in introduces the show up rate, uh which then, you know, is then cost per sale because we know our basic close rates. Of course, we're working on sales. Of course, we're trying to optimize show or close rates. Of course, we're trying to optimize sets and like all that, but like what can marketing control? So, that's fire. I like that. What about you, offer publisher man? What is your official thing now? You've been talking about lots of things. You're talking about leaning in, going deep, going here, there. I don't know what you want to talk about or not public, but do you have uh Oh, we just same thing as always. Just I uh progress. No, I mean for me it's like deeper like we talked about like low ticket. I mean first low ticket or first funnel I ever built for a client was low ticket funnel went on to do over a million in six months and I continued to low ticket and I just didn't really think about it. I didn't go deep just went wide and started stacking skills other places. I was like let me just keep going and obviously I started dou so I started going deeper into low ticket started doing more done hundreds of offers now done all of that but I was like no like there's another level to this like I haven't I need to go even deeper into it. So for me like personal goals is like I just want to be I want to get even better at ascension and like when you think about low ticket it's just financial model. It's it's not like I'm not just thinking about the front end. I'm thinking the full funnel ascension mainly like the just it's a financial model. How do you sell multiple things to one person over a series of time keep them happy? Like it's just that's what I want to get really good at and like leading people up. And so for me I'm just like locked in on that. And so that the nice thing is with my publishing, I mean, we just do low ticket for our people. So it's like the financial model is used in all the deals that I'm publishing and so I get to practice that. And then I'm also doing a lot more consulting on it just to like continue to work things and see data and test it. So, you know, we're we're doing that. We're we're relaunching um one of our low ticket offers for low ticket offers.com meta. Um, and we're going to do that and then just like staying super dialed into it and just like mastering like what is the next like every solution creates a new problem. And so it never starts doing the classic like book a call right after someone buys and what what happens what's next? What's the next meta of ascension? One thing that's working well is webinars. We're doing webinars in it. But I'm like what's next? Like once that stuff what's what's the next thing? How are we going to do it? how like my thought was like you know uh Ian he freaking he sent like a little we were talking about this before like they send out like these little letters right and like should we send these to our low ticket purchaser I don't know like hey by the way like thanks for joining schedule here's a QR code and it costs like twoish $1 so our cost acquisition you know fulfillment goes up by a dollar or two I don't know like but I'm just solely focusing on like how can we just do and then also it's like organic okay how do We continue with all our clients to get them out in our organic cuz status and organic is huge and it it makes your funnel stats look awesome. Other places like one of the things you guys do super well and we've talked about this is you're not just a you're a direct response company but you're not really like you you're not really you have so much we would we would lose in a in a gunfight against a direct response only. Yeah, exactly. But the reason why you're able to sustain and like sell something like you do. So anyways, that's my focus and just that like what's the next step? Cuz I knew I said I was like two or I was like three. Yeah, it would have been three years ago. A year before I got married. I said I was talking to people like what are you doing? I'm like well I'm going to master loia funnels and then the next issue is ascension cuz getting to buy a loia product is not hard. It's how do you ascend them? And so I was like I'm focused on ascension. And now I believe we're in that era where it's like ascension and figure out how to do that do it well is my focus. And then yeah, obviously scaling up across the board, I took, you know, I started hiring, we talked about like I need an operator. I need like a mini me. So I duplicated I'm like 50% there to duplicating myself. Uh the dude I'm working with. He's amazing. Shout out you if you're watching this. Dude, he crushed it. We did internal projects for like one of my offers. So I essentially let him publish me and I said, "Okay, I'm pretend I'm the creator. Publish me." And he crushed it. Like just finished like a massive funnel build. the launch, the emails. I like looked over some stuff. I only changed a few things. He said, "Film this, do that." He did well with project management. He did well at that. And so, he could do the project management and the marketing, which is what I wanted to see. But I want him just in the marketing. So, we also hired a VA to help with project management. And so, now I have an amazing funnel designer who's amazing. Like, I was talking to your CMO today and he looked at one of our funnels and he was like, "Who's your designer?" and now he wants to take him, but I'm not going to let him. Um, but an amazing funnel designer. I have almost a duplicated me. I have a project manager VA and then me overseeing it. So, I'm trying to build a seal team six where I can deploy into any offer. Yeah. And like go for sprint for 90 days to the point where it doesn't need us as much anymore. And then we can either and get to maintenance mode. Obviously, I feel like there's no such thing as maintenance in this game. you're always good, but like no passive income, less sprinting, less sprinting, I guess. You know, sprint for 90 days and you know, so that's our focus now. And so, props to you. Like I love your deeper uh not wider thing. That thing really helped me lock in because like dude, I was about to just like h whatever. Let's get offers. I told you I was going to give Yeah. Anyways, there's a lot of stuff for I was just going to jump ship and do something new. So, I like it. Yeah. keep I keep I mean I send people your way for beginners who want to learn the model and business model to like basically offer publish right but like do the expert business model um people keep asking me and I keep talking about you know marketer expert and then operator once you want to get to the point where you're not just doing launches and making a couple hundred grand or a million bucks and then down to 80% less than that on evergreen basis like you kind of want all three if you're going evergreen you're definitely if you're going to scale of over seven figures a month um but yeah I think it's uh I think it's a good model I think The low ticket thing is always we talk about webinars, we talk about low ticket, we talk about all these things. Everything works, right? Everything works. You'll find some funnel that's been running the same one for 10 years. All like I think that's the biggest thing helped me is detaching from feeling I need one thing. Detaching from believing there's like one right way to do it and be like, "No, I need everything problems." Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "Oh, no, no, we need like people are killing it with challenge funnels. We have to do a challenge funnel." Like yes, there may be some merit in it, but like no, you don't. like you can continue to run one VSSL call funnel and do a lot through it. Like there are ways to do it and then the Dan Kennedy or I think it's Dan Kennedy but like you know whoever can pay the most to acquire a customer wins like at a certain point if you master the other part which is like the actual business which is the LTV which is the actual ascension which is all these other pieces puzzle customer experience. If you acquired 10 customers and it cost you 10 grand a pop or whatever but you knew that like those customers are never going to leave and they're going to pay you forever because you have the stickiest MR thing ever. You would never need to run another challenge funnel or webinar or whatever. Like you want both. You want more acquisition, yes. You want consistent acquisition, yes. You ideally want at a consistent rate, yes. But if this part is crushing and like I'm the first to say this is something that we have not mastered and like why we've been in a pinch at when we're at 1.5 or breaking even or whatever, like if you look at the math, it's not exactly how it works. But like we have not focused on LTV in retention. We're doing another re uh retention generating event right now. Between upsells, downells, between continuity, between other product SKs, like we talked about supplements before, other products, other offerings, we didn't have like dumb dude. We acquired 20,000 customers at a mid like an okay CPA and then because we churned them after a year, it's like there goes the potential to make three, five, 10x more on ROAT, like gone. And like okay, cool. We have a win back pipeline now and you own the data kind of but like holy did we drop the ball and lose 10 30 $50 million on the back over one year or two years let alone if you had these customers for the next 10 years and they paid you two grand or five grand on average a year. It's like like that stuff is so yeah I mean what you're doing I think is great though with the acquisition but I think the biggest thing too is like how do you want to sell and how do you want to fulfill because for me I don't want to build I don't like building sales focused companies where it's callfunnel based so I'd rather do low ticket webinar and like because for me in my own businesses I never really did call funnels I just I like to pull people in and use like more of the math kind of like Eman likes to go to big events like that. I'd rather do that. So me personal like dude, do I know I can make money with call funnels? 100%. Have I done it? Yes, I know it works. I work with companies that do it on low ticket funnels 100%. But just for the things I'm publishing our offers. It's just for me personally, I don't want to optimize that type of company. So I think a lot of people watching this, you figure out what do you want to be responsible for? What do you not want to be responsible for? Build a business around that and then see if you need to compromise in some of the areas where you're feeling picky to grow the business and help more people win. Because there's some ways like you need to like I can't sit here and be like I'm never going to do this cuz I don't want to do it. It's like at some point maybe I will have to do a call funnel if I really want to hit the goals I want to hit and I'm going to have to die to that. So it's it's this weird balance. You just have to figure out what do you want to do and what do you not want to do. So I agree and I think your ICP being people who haven't cracked low ticket like it's a huge unlock that's kind of like a bigger bucket and there's different ways to do low ticket too. It's like it's the concept the cool thing about low ticket I feel like is the concept of the difference between lead leads versus buyers that you're selling to when you get to the next layers. So like that like a challenge funnel versus a webinar versus whatever like I don't those aren't that crazy different whatever like yes you have different consumption yes you have different priming yes you have different economics but like the beauty of low ticket with economics and the the fact that you have now buyers in your system instead of leads is like the big thing. So, you take these guys that only run call funnels as us as an example and you're like, "Oh, cool. I can come in here and build you guys a funnel for 50k or whatever math." Yeah. Uh or percents or whatever. Like, that's a huge unlock for a business. It changes the economics across the entire business. We're we have a a revenue generating event coming up soon for for offer publisher. I'll tease a little bit, but like one of the biggest opportunities we're telling our students right now is the lack of like the issue. People like no load ticket and they don't want to learn it. Like the amount of companies like the offer owner doesn't want to build it. Yeah, dude. Like companies doing millions and millions a month hitting me up air saying, "Hey, we know we need low ticket. We just don't know how to do it cuz I've only done one funnel. We just want to pay someone to do it." And so for people like us, like what we do, we found creators, they have a premium validated offer and like someone like you would be free and low ticket and we say, "Hey, we will build, fund, and run optimize a front-end funnel. we just want a percentage of like the sales that this funnel generates on the back end and we negotiate a deal there. And so we're publishing these experts while owning all the front end and the funnels and everything like that. And so it's like this good balance where it's like we both need each other, but honestly it's like I could replace them on the back end and switch out the face if they really wanted to screw me over, not so it's like there's such a big opportunity there that I consider like the tipping point and it's like we're raising we need multiple funnels and so people like if you're watching this like freelancers agency like that like they will they need people like you and there's a ton of these offrunners that came from Sam Ovens days, traffic and funnel days, clients community days, all these high ticket people that only got tough one funnel that are now like and then and then they got taught school go do low ticket recurring info and now they're like frick that didn't work as well as I thought with info so now they're like where do I go and so they need someone like you someone like me to go out there and do that for them so there's big big opportunity there yeah no info coaching is real right now selling info that's bite-sized and pushing them up into coaching I see the entire market shifting into a lot I mean it already has shifted just an observation I'm making is it's so much there's so much coaching now, so much hybrid, so much like that side of things. And I like it. I mean, I think you can get more personalization, you can get people more results than them just logging into a course that has no community and hoping they get a result. Like, I like it. So, I got a pop. Uh, you rock. Hey, you too. Keep crushing it, bro. Keep crushing. Thanks for not cutting me off. Bye, friends.
