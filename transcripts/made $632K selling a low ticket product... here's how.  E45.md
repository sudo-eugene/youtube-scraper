In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we made $62,960 using a low ticket ascension funnel. And by the end of this video, you're going to understand the math behind it and how to implement one of these in your high ticket business. I'm going to do a quick funnel overview and I promise you it is simpler than it looks. And then go through the metrics and math behind it for low ticket purchasers, cash calls, and the ascension rates. And then I'm going to go through the new plan that we have to scale the out of this thing and some examples of what happens when we do. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected. In total we've done 71 million in this business. And I am not selling anything. All the entire channel is is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So let's get into it. So first things first, what is a low ticket ascension funnel? Essentially, you are selling a low ticket product, $20, $7, you know, upwards of $100 with the goal of getting them to ascend to your back-end product, which is usually a high ticket, 5K, 10K, 20K product. Okay? So, the entire goal is not necessarily like AOV and breaking even where it costs you 50 bucks to get the customer and you make 50 bucks. That's like I mean that is the goal to self-liquidate fully. But really really what it is and usually what happens is you partially self-liquidate or liquidate the front end and then the net amount when ascended is cheaper than if you were to run a VSSL funnel or some of these other types. So for example, this is the one we are running right now. It is one product and it has one AOV. There are no order bumps. There are no uh Otto upsells anything. All because the goal is ascension. All right. So we tested to start three different front-end sales pages. The front-end sales page is just going to collect the name and email and push them then to a checkout page. Okay, so this one is actually like an original one that I created that's super ugly and like pretty long form. They're actually all long form, but this one's really ugly. And these are two professionally designed ones, a light version and a dark version with like a lot of the same copy. So, in the first iterations of this one was basically completely knocked out of the race. Um, and I made a video on, sorry, just looking at the sheet real quick. April 3rd talking about how we had done about 30 grand just testing this and we're still testing it, but we've done 600 now. So, um, these two are the main that are running and we're kind of constantly trying to test and beat the control with variations of this and they're very close, like kind of neck and neck in the testing, but we are getting name and email here. They're going to a checkout page where uh they actually purchase then they land on a booking page. So instead of an Otto that's, you know, they go from a $50 product to a $500 product or $199 product to try and get an increased blended AOV on that to offset your advertising cost. Instead, the goal is to get them to book in. And for us, they're booking in with a setter. They then talk to the setter, comes in as a call scheduled. They either no-show the call, cancel the call, uh turns into a follow-up that needs to happen, or they're lost, or the real thing is set. Okay. Once they're set, they go over here and they move into a closer call, into a call scheduled. And then from there, that call either no show, cancel, hot listing, long-term follow-up, close lost, or one, meaning they ascended and purchased our high-end or high ticket product in the back end. Okay. Now, math and sections behind this. So, across this range, I pulled data actually year to date. So the real like true testing window of when we have been we had it running for a bit prior but like when we really turned it on dedicated ad accounts dedicated pixels all the setup was about a month and a half agoish let's call it um so mid-March but this is year-to- date numbers because we were still selling it and there was still Ascension we've had 2,000 units sold of this specific low ticket product from that we have made $76,960 in cash collected there setter calls calls we have had oops sorry setter calls we've had 923 booked so that is what has hit this portion now the math on this what actually is happening around 60 to 70% of the people that purchase the low ticket are booking in here so I'm giving you the total numbers but we have like iterated we've like split test pages we've increased that rate from 40% or literally zero because we didn't even offer it for a portion there was no setters on the team so these numbers are a little wonk in terms of what I'm going to say for these uh percentages, but around 60 to 70% of them are booking in a call with a setter. Those setter calls that then go on to a closer call has the highest show rate and close rate of anything in the entire company through any other acquisition method. Okay, so again, sorry, looking at data over here real quick, but the show rate on those right now monthtodate is 76.7% and the live call close is like 23%. And that is with us having issues in other places not optimized, not doing this. So like the math maths uh aggressively in that versus any other acquisition model that we're using. So how many back-end purchases that turned into? 81 bought our low uh bought our high ticket cash collected on this $526,000 which is a 3.89% ascension. Now if you watch any of the other past videos, I talk about how 4% is like the target and then above that is like the real where we want to land. Now the reason it is low here but we are now leaning into it. This entire time has been a testing period more or less where we have been trying to see where it backs out and what the time from purchase from initial purchase to backend ascension is. And instead of us trying to scale this and sell 500 units of these a day, you have a massive cash trough if you're not liquidating on the front end, which we are not fully. Um you have a mass massive cash trough until you know what that percent is. So why this number is 3.89 is because I just pulled these numbers 30 seconds before I made this video. And that is including this month and today and whatever's units which don't even have time to ascend. So this average that is out here again sorry peeping data over here. The average is somewhere in 3 to 5 days that they're even booking a call. And then from when someone books a call there's generally follow-up. I mean they are they're built as one call closes here but they're technically now since this newest iteration two call closes. So you have time between this call and this call. You have follow-up between these calls and you have follow-up from the post call to the close. So there is a time trough that is unknown. And that's why we didn't want to lean in and scale into this thing. Even if the initial metrics and cost pers made looked good. Okay. So 3.89 right now. But really if I back this thing up, it's over 4%. Well over. So or or going in the direction of well over. So that's extremely good math for us. Now, what is the plan for this? And then I'll touch on these green boxes here. New plan. These have scale limits. So, both the product and the awareness level of what the product is that we're running. So, there's a bunch of guys that used to do this in internet marketing and they kind of still do, but like they would lean into like a a productivity suite for landscapers, call it a productivity suite for somebody who does uh Facebook ads, something like that, right? like that is a niche within a niche and it only has so much volume that you can do on a daily basis. And why that is kind of an issue or a limiter uh is because if only 3.8% of these people are buying your backend product, you would have to sell 100 units a day to round up sell four high ticket units on the back end. Now, if your targets are for you to be selling 20 units of high ticket on the back end, you either need other acquisition meth methods or you need to scale the out of this. And that is extremely unlikely because your CPA is going to go through the roof. The market size, just the general scale of when you start to increase spend on something like this is going to increase that net CPA. So that's an issue. So for us, we're kind of feeling that out. Uh we have a more mass market audience, which is why we should have been doing this the whole time and we're stupid. But for 71 million, we just did a high ticket of the SL call funnel. I have other videos on the channel talking about those and kind of where we did. And then the other one, a scale limiter is availability. So one of the things that is not often talked about when using right affiliates, partnerships and all this is when you use a call funnel you have a rate limiter on availability. So on any given day there are only so many setters, sales people, whatever that will have open spots and availability and that is your like throughput issue, right? Like you can't because of that be able to book into calendars. If I if I had an affiliate send a thousand new customers of this product today, it would instantly break because we only have 60 available spots for setters on a given day. So, you have to be able to like scale those linear as you go across or you drop all your percents down because if there's no availability for setters, they don't end up on setter calendars and they never make it to a closer and then they don't buy. So, your ascension drops through the floor, right? Like, you have to be able to model those off this. So, not only is am I I'm basically saying two things that are going against each other, but awareness level if you're trying to scale this up, you need something that's mass market enough where you can sell 500 units a day or 200 or whatever number to hit your backend target, which is 3% 5% whatever ascension rates. There's a really big guy in the internet marketing space that used to say that his was three at for like a long time like when at scale and that's like a good target number that a lot of people will go for. We're going for four on this just because we can, but 3%'s a good one. But if you have a target of three on the back end, that's three high ticket units for every 100. So you sell 300 units, you do nine. And the timetable in which that happens is different on every single one of these, which you need to be aware of. So affiliates and partnerships, that is on the table for our plan to do this. But in order to do that, we need to solve for this and make sure that we do it in a stairstep approach to where we have the availability on both the setter and the closer schedules in order to scale this. All right. Now, scaling limits just kind of like quick back to this. The other option with the nich the niche and awareness is having either multiple of these or having another one instead that is like the actual big one. So, think broader for your market niche. Think as like kind of broad as you can get. And if you can find something that still solves a problem but is able to sell 100 to 300 to 500 units a day, that would be more of the plan. So you wouldn't have to have nine of these. And again, there's another internet marketing example where guys had 10 12 of these all running at the same time. And it just gets kind of confusing. You need different pods of setters for different things because they're having different calls that are framed differently. What did the person buy? Um just stuff like that. So automations next step push to purchase, push to book, push to app, and push to show. So when somebody apply or opts in but does not check out, we have a sequence that pushes them to purchase. We just now like put more depth into that and like kind of redid the copy. So that'll get a small lift. We just now did when someone purchases but does not book a call with a setter. They have a push to book sequence that also includes an SMS because now we have their phone number. On this next sequence, we have a push to app, which is after they book, we try and get them to fill out an application because stats show that if someone fills out an app and puts more information in like the free form boxes and stuff like that, they have more emotional buy in and they are more likely to purchase. Push to show. Oops. That we have literally I think we just rolled this out this morning and today's the 26th. So, this data was not being tracked properly because we were doing so much of it. I didn't even know what the show rate was because we're ramping so many siders at the same time, ramping so many low tickets. I couldn't even tell you if it was a 30% show rate or an 80% show rate, but I knew that these numbers were getting to the closers and the math was working here. So, I kind of didn't care for a minute. Okay? Like, we we sacrifice the data for that. Now, now that I and I know this number, it could be better. Let's just say that. So, uh we put in place calendarly auto reminders. We put in place emails warm-up to try and push them to show for the call and give them framing on why they should show for the call. scripting on this is also changing and the setters are getting better because they are brand new. So now they have more iteration um or more experience more so and now they are able to set more from there and then we're also working on a ton of stuff. We're hiring a sales manager right now. We're like reworking we're going to rework that whole thing so we can scale aggressively. Um and I have another video where I just talked about this yesterday where I talk about the whole sales team shift and what we're doing there. Okay, split test. We are, like I said in the beginning, kind of constantly split testing these because we're just trying to break this down to where just off this alone, the net CPA is within a KPI target that we chose. So, call it 60 bucks, call it 100 bucks, whatever number it is 20% above that right now. And the goal is to make it it's 20% above that interchangeably. Like sometimes we're in KPI, sometimes we're not, which means we need the sometimes not days to be 20% under so that these the bad days are within KPI as well on average. So, we're working on that here. But what we can also do with those optimizations is AOV boosters. So, those are currently in the pipeline. Those are actual products and we are uh extremely careful and really make sure that our brand stays intact when we launch stuff like this. So, we need to make sure the brand quality and product quality is there. I like to say that as a big differentiator of what we do and why we have kind of a bigger moat is because we have proper expert, we have proper coaches. I mean, we have however many thousands of reviews now. Um, it's important to us that the product quality is there. So, we're not just going to slap on something and sell it just to increase AOV if that is then not going to carry through and have continuity to our back-end products and our actual brand of the company. So, AOV boosters, someone buys, you know, what did I use earlier? Calendar example or productivity example. Next one is a workbook or calendar uh a morning routine book this and that. You can add those as uh order bumps to the checkout, which is statistically proven to not decrease the checkout page uh percentage or the the conversion rate on the checkout page and then still get the Otto. So, the goal being if you're selling something for 50 bucks, you have three of these on here, it can increase the blended AOV to a $65 and you get that $15 blended across the whole thing back against your ads, which makes it so you can scale harder without affecting the ascension, which is huge because a lot of people will have like upsell one, upsell two, downell like over here and all of that. We don't want that because we want to optimize for the bookings, but we still want to increase the AOV and that is the place to do it inside the checkout. So, those are currently being built because again, it's important to us to have the brand quality. And then this is a funny one I just want to talk about. I just talked to someone today that said call paid where they actually took this Otto booking and literally made it an Otto booking where the implementation call was a paid thing that was like click here if you want to purchase this booking or p purchase a call with a team and framed in this way that's you know it calls 10 bucks or 50 bucks or something. So you're actually getting paid to get them on a call with a setter and that increases show rates. I mean you get 100% show rate on that. It increases AOV, but it likely decreases the volume. And I don't know if we're really in the business of wanting to do a paid version and then if they say no, basically giving it to them for free because we do want that. I don't really know where we s with that, but that was a fun idea and just thought it would be potential. So now, examples on how the math works overall on this for a high ticket business. Let's say you're $10 net and you have a 3% ascension, which is crazy. uh the $10 net part, that's a $333 net CPA for your back-end product. Now, let's say that net CPA climbs uh way higher, which is much more realistic with uh meta marketing. Let's say $50 net, $1,600 CPA, and a $75 net is $2,500 CPA. Now, anybody who runs high ticket VSSL funnels or any of those things know that depending on what you're talking about or like how qualified your niche, like you could have $400 calls, 50% show rates, and a 20% close rate. And what is that? $400 calls, 50 across. That's a $4,000 CPA versus this model has you at 25, you know, 330, which is is the unrealistic example, but like this isn't that crazy. $2,500. So, you could drop $1,500 on on your CPA for every unit using this. Now, there's a million ways to do this. There's book funnels. There are low ticket actual AOV focused ones that break even. Um, there are people that run it with this exact model. Like, I know a guy who runs this with 3x rorowaz on this front end just right here because the ticket is higher and they're great marketers. So, they'll sell something for $100. It'll cost him $25 per purchase. They'll make 75 bucks on it. Someone will book and the same ascension rate will occur. So they're making money on the front and the back. So you could actually have this as a negative net CPA, which is just like crazy. Um, and then yeah, the ascension rate is huge. So if you can optimize the funnel, look at the differences on these. The big one is this one right here because it's most realistic. Let's say you keep all your Facebook stuff the same and you it cost you 75 bucks here, but you only get 3% to ascend. And then here, $75, but you get 5% to ascend. It drops a,000 bucks off the CPA. And when you're selling 15 units a day, you're you're keeping 15 grand that you're not spending on ads to acquire the same amount of customers. So that's the math. That's the plan. There are some other things on the back end of this portion like the product portal, that's a big one. The Facebook group or whatever community group you guys use is a big one. So nurturing within there. Because when I say these numbers, you know, we have 2,000. Think about that. Like my joke, my sticky note is like everyone is someone like 20080 is 280 people who purchase the product and are in the Facebook group and are consuming the product and you know whatever it is 80% of people that buy info products never open them. You can look how many are open last sign and all that. However many 280 purchased this product and only 81 of them so far have bought the high ticket and all of them are buying this product because they want the result that your backend has right. They want the one that your backend per product what that solves. So being able to come up with a good way to nurture them in the Facebook group provide an immense amount of value but also kind of limiting in the low ticket product to where the real sauce and the real way to get the result the quickest way the fastest way the uh most realistic the you know confidence in it all those ways is through the back end. So doing what you can to get this number into this number right as best you can. So portal Facebook group all those things. Quick update I made this doc below this. So, www.rycl. You have to do WW cuz I broke something on ClickFunnels and I don't care to change it. And it has all the videos. This is day I don't even know 45 in a row of doing these. Um, we are hiring a sales manager right now. It is our biggest kind of choke hold on the business. Marketing is crushing. We are hitting like all-time high or this year all-time high. So, year-to- date uh highest call days in a row and we've hitting them day over day like the same exact volume basically. and we'll do 15 units, then we'll do five units, then we'll do 16 units, then we'll do seven units, then we'll do 14. And it's just like the inconsistency around that um team and execution is something that we need to work on in order to scale because without that feedback loop back to marketing, we don't know what split tests, what funnels, what anything is working because we track everything on marketing back to the actual back-end purchase, not just the cost per lead, cost per book, cost per anything because that doesn't matter. What matters is who actually buys the back end and where the real rorowaz comes from. Okay, so that's the update. Yesterday we did 95,500 actually 95,495 and yeah, we are scaling in the right direction. We've had a few days over 100K. We've had a few days at like 50 to 60 G's. And it's that back and forth. So we're getting in the right direction, but we're still not even close to where we want to be. And next thing to solve for is sales. Doing some backend stuff. I'll make some videos on some updates of where we are and as we come into the end of the month, a month in review. So comment below any questions you guys have. X and comments on here and I will talk with you soon.
