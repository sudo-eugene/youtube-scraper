What's up, guys? In today's video, we have Julius. This is a highly, highly recommended and sought after episode, so I'm excited to get this one on here. Julius, who are you? Uh, my name is Julius. I am a marketer, copywriter, sales guy, all things how to sell to people. Uh, right now I am working on scaling a funding brokerage. Uh, right now I was in credit repair. before that. We're still doing something right there in terms of like offers that I've run. My background more so is in actually working within companies. So, I'm really kind of new to this whole like operator thing, which is why I absolutely loved your channel. Like I found it, my business partner actually sent it to me first. I was like, "Yo, like you need to watch this guy." And so, I've been uh the one video that you had about like hiring, tracking people, like the KPIs, all that stuff just really good because I'm new to actually operating. In terms of selling, I've been in SAS. I was head of product. um product growth for SAS company, ventureback SAS company over in Europe. I was in an agency. I handled all the accounts, did all the marketing. We're managing like up to like a million dollars a month in budget there, which if you know anything about Europe, that's a lot over there. Here it's like almost nothing, right? But over there, it's a lot. Um did some lead genen stuff like fractional consulting on the side. uh worked in info lead genen again like every vertical like from local to final expense which for all my paper call guys I'm gonna have some sauce for you guys later uh all that stuff um coaching a lot of uh a lot of like low ticket info products so I actually started in like dating I'll get into that as well like writing copy for dating offers I was mostly front end like almost all front end so like all the copy all the ad creatives like stuff like that is the media buying as well the media buying side was more on the agency And like I just I wrote the copy and then I noticed that all the media buyers were like kind of like botching the accounts and stuff like that. I was like, "Yo, my copy is so good. Uh like you guys need to push this correctly." So I just went on there and I actually learned how to do media buying just so that I could have full control over all that. And I got so good I just took over from them. And then that's where I actually I learned the skill set of media buying as well alongside the copy and the messaging all that stuff. So rounding out had to learn how to manage and ramp a sales team which was new to me still new to me terrifying it was like I was like how I don't know how to you know but um just rounding out my skill set there and now you know operations is still like my my biggest weakness and even on Twitter I say this stuff like I know some things this is all my opinion none of this is hard truth because if there's one thing that I've learned is that there's a million ways to do something it's just the way that I've done it like everything that I talk about is the way I've done a test that's actually worked. So, yeah, that's just about me. 100%. Dude, I say the same thing. It is these are all opinions or things that we've done, right? That's the beauty of this is whether it worked or didn't work. And I'm happy to share that uh what we're currently doing. So, you were the first one. Oh, you need you need a number. I'm sorry. You need a number. I I like wrote this down in my notes. I was like, wait, he needs an actual number. And it's so hard because I've been in so many. Okay. for for businesses that I've been in where I've had a actual impact on the front end in terms of sales like as that I've written you know messaging that I've done or media buying that I've done the numbers around 17 million in terms of revenue generated not all me that was not all mess okay I was just a guy on the front was like actually writing the copy and all that stuff so I I know I had to give you a number and I had to like kind of like pull like I usually just pull one from somewhere random and then people hate on yeah literally yeah I'll take it I'll take 17. He fully did everything and it was a whole Yeah. Um All right, cool. You were the first one ever to put me on. So, context for everyone who's listening. Uh I had probably two 300 subscribers on and I was making a video a day. I was probably 35 days into doing so. And uh Julius was in my DMs on Instagram and we were going back and forth and he was asking some questions. I was asking some questions and I was out on a golf course and he's like, "I'm going to put you on." And I was like, "I didn't even have X on my phone." And all of a sudden I'm like seeing these charts go like this. I'm like, "What's going and he tweeted and literally next day it's like 3,000 on YouTube, 3,000 on X. So forever indebted to the initial Kickstart. I appreciate it. But dude, so welld deserved. So welld deserved, man. Genuinely like your content is insane. Insane. So well that I appreciate that. I'm going to be glazing this episode. Today is all about you. So we're going to learn this. So you pull questions. I'm going to put X directly next to this right here. But you have perfect 29 questions on this sheet that came from X from everyone. and we're going to start on the top and then you and I'll bounce back and forth. But first one that keen to hear how you approach hooks based on the awareness of the audience. So hooks that convert for cold versus hooks for people in lower in the funnel. So top of funnel versus bottom of funnel awareness levels. How do you do it? Okay, it's funny the question kind of answers itself a little bit. If you're aware enough that based off of your based off of your marketing right now, I have ran x amount through cold. I'm seeing like people are coming in that are, you know, unaware of the problem or problem aware or something like that. You have a top offunnel channel and top offunnel messaging that's like working that's converting. You're kind of already halfway there because you can kind of tell based off of the split testing on the front end like where people So the way that I structure my creative tests, so I have my CBR, AB, whatever I do and I have really good naming conventions for my actual like adsets. So I will sometimes test awareness levels of the actual market that I want to go for in my cold prospect cold prospecting campaigns. A lot of people do that. Cold prospecting campaign retargeting campaign. I'm shifting away slowly but surely from retargeting campaigns because Facebook does a lot of retargeting. You can like see just go through like your frequency, your 7day, whatever. And there's ways to actually like set that up. Like you can see that Facebook does a lot of retargeting for you. A lot of the media buyers on the ecom DTOC side of Twitter will tell you that too. They've kind of stopped running retargeting campaigns. And so I will split test awareness levels in my adsets for my cold prospecting. So I'll go for problem unaware. This is like where my indirect leads come from. So like I share a lot on Twitter about like writing indirect messaging. And so that's where that'll come in. And then I'll have my solution aware, right? Or perceived solution aware, right? And so there I'll be like very heavily mechanistic copy. And then I'll have my problem aware right there. There's like your everyone almost everyone operates in the problem aware space. Almost everyone does problem aare messaging which I think is something that needs to change which we'll get into. But in terms of like the hooks, there was a guy Mark uh Puscetti. He has this thing called awareness positioning and I love it. He's like your awareness positioning is your hook. So it's like where you sit in the spectrum of like what the market is aware of in terms of your solution or their problem. That is your hook right there. Right? And so oftentimes this comes to everyone does like the desire thing, right? Like, oh, want to do XYZ, right? And then maybe they'll add a modifier like without ABC or something like that. That's like the most You hate one, two, three. Yeah. Yes. Like that's the most common type of hook that at least I see a lot of the times. What I like to do, my favorite kind of hook is catalyst hooks. These are my favorite now. And so I'm learning this a lot from affiliates. Affiliates are great people to swipe ads, like fantastic people to swipe ads from affiliates. They love their catalyst. So, let's say um someone in Florida, let's say it's a guy running a uh I don't know, let's an insurance ad, right? An insurance affiliate and they target by state, right? Because the coverage. So, let's say it's like they're running to Florida, right? I live in Florida. I'm going to see an ad and it says, "Florid residents now have the opportunity to do whatever because of either this new law or this new tool or this new system, whatever." When I was in MVA, we did a lot of that. Yeah. Right. These are my favorite now because in these as a market gets like more and as an auction gets noisier and noisier, everyone like people become claim resistant. It's like the banner blindness, right? Right? It's like they they hear a claim, they hear a thing. It's like it's because people are scrolling all the time. They see all these ads. And so you need to even justify why the thing is happening, right? And so it's because of this thing right here. Now you can do XYZ. Because of this new financing plan, you can get a roof for 59 bucks a month. I get hit by those like every day, dude. Right. And so that's my like every day. That's my new favorite kind of hook to run now. And I'm testing this like aggressively across offers, even the funding stuff, even like the B2B stuff. It works really, really well. Yeah, that's that's what I was going to ask. So that works across. Yeah, because what you said Yeah. So what you said so far, so I mean Yeah. And again for everyone here, like I this is not as much my speed. I'm going to ask questions this entire time. Like I exist more on economics of this and understanding overall strategy than I do like hook versus like you I mean all of that. But I I have a concept of this. So I'll try to navigate this as best as possible. But so when you're talking about those awareness levels and an example for what we see is for our low ticket right now the it's almost acting as a retargeting asset more than a cold asset and that's because the awareness level the mechanism is like in the middle right more so than it is up here. It's not really like broad cold friendly to where it's the seven days in two second you know like all that kind of stuff. It's not built for that. Um so we're going through that but question I have for this top section because yes you can test based on these three buckets of what you were saying right on awareness level but within the top how are you testing across the top section of you know what I mean like like problemishaw aware right so problem solution product how are you doing it in there on the top layer so let's say we're talking about problem aware right so let's say we have just the just the buckets that's problem aware when someone's problem aware and I'm going to get into mechanisms and I was going to leave this for later because I had a question that I wanted to talk about this but we'll I'll I'll start it here and then I'll go more in depth there. Uh Stefan Georgu I think he popularized the idea of the unique problem mechanism. I'm pretty sure he popularized that concept. I know it's been talked about before um but I'm sure that he popularized that concept. And so for people who are problem aware, it's very important that you tell them why they're having the problem in the first place. So everyone knows like agitate the problem, right? You also have to explain why that problem is there. And so for example, you were talking about this in one of your podcasts, the prebiotic ad. Someone mentioned I forgot who the who the guy was, but you're Yeah. Yeah. the prebiotics, right? Yeah. And so prebiotic, first of all, let's say I'm let's say I'm selling like a gut health supplement. Okay, cool. unaware. Oh, uh, my gut health is a thing. What's a gut health? Right. I didn't even know that was a thing. Problem aware. Okay, it's my gut health now, right? I know that I have a gut health problem. Why do I have a gut health problem? What is this? Right? Then the ad goes into the VSSL goes into this thing of the prebiotic. That's the solution mechanism. But the problem mechanism is that you don't have this prebiotic in your system. You need this thing because of and then you go into the justifier loops, right? Right? And this is where the unique problem mechanism sits. Your uh I don't know anything about biology. I'm about to embarrass myself. Your gut microbiome doesn't have enough thing to feed on. And so this leads to this this this this, right? And so if you want to that's in like a BSL or sales level, you want to condense that into a hook. It's very very simple. You say if you've been struggling with this, right? you can do something here like stop doing and then perceived solutions to the thing because everyone who's in a problem aware market they've looked at other solutions right or they've heard other messages they they like think they know what to do right so the easiest simplest way to do this stop um stop doing stop taking what's a gut health supplement do I don't take supplements I don't know what's a what's a gut some like what some like gut health supplement we can stay on the we can stay on Craig Clemens it's we're down the same path here we'll stay on Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, stop taking these supplements. Stop working out. Stop drinking water. Stop I don't know sleeping, right? Like whatever people think that I don't know like whatever people think is the solution to that. Just like diss all of those, right? And then be like the actual problem is your gut doesn't have prebiotics and then you can go like write better copy for this so that your gut can do XYZ and then you can go into the solution. Right. Got it. for unaware. Well, yeah, let's say unaware. I feel like unaware is such like a vague thing because people are oftent times they're aware that like something's wrong. I think um Albert um he he categorized this as like people have this feeling, this energy that's like something's not right. Right. And that's like usually where the unaware market sits. For unaware, it's the easiest thing in the world because you just tell them something that they haven't heard before. Yeah. It's the easiest thing in the world. problem aware is I think the hardest and then solution aware is the easiest because is is easier because solution aware you just go into mechanistic copy right reason why all right as O Gilby says it right and so that's how I would structure the hooks that's the simplest way to do it if I know nothing about your offer nothing about your like your formulation that's the easiest way to do it yeah I uh only time I ever had any direct experience like real real was when uh I was doing some of Chris Reer stuff like I bought on his courses one time and they do like really really mass volume affiliate stuff. Um, so they're like super affiliates. They use YouTube ads, but everything was around that hook and like basically the the shift right there. And you're going pretty broad with his stuff, but he crushes that. So, uh, let's move through these because we have 29. And uh yes, we're going to see where uh number two on here is if if you're trying to scale a DD DTOC high ticket brand that's in a niche that's mostly commoditized, for example, saunas, how would you go about considering it not an impulse buy, funnels, positioning, mechanism, ads, VSSL? What's the overall strategy? So overall strategy is how are you taking something that's commoditized like a sauna? Yeah. And building it out to be something that you would do, you know, DDC direct response with. I assume is what he means by this instead of just brand. Yeah. So, one of our in terms of like actual like markups like how like the the funnel structure and the channel and then all that stuff. Um, we had a furniture brand as a client like back in the agency. Um, and this is going to be a very unsexy answer. It was as simple as longtail Google Google uh keyword ads and then some SEO on the back end. Um, and then we had a blog which was just like furniture styling blog. So, it was we just ramped up a bunch of keywords. So, like here's how to style XYZ, here's how to do this, right? Here's how to uh have your dream living room, what your dream living room looks like, right? And then like we had like a bunch of inspo stuff like that. It would go off to Pinterest as well because we had a social media manager would go off to Pinterest. They'd create boards that backlink back, right? So, in terms of like markups like that messaging now, let's go into the messaging. And that's the only experience that I have with like any high ticket ecom like I don't I don't like to touch commoditized stuff. I really don't. I'm selfish and I'm lazy. I like to go for stuff where I have some kind of arbitrage opportunity in the demand genen. That's where I like to operate. Um, but if I was doing this in terms of messaging, there's the easiest way, which is just go upscale, go up market, right? Like basically 5x your price point, take some really sexy pictures, right? Like that's like literally the easiest way to do it. Like I've seen people do that where it's like the same literally the same exact product. They just mark up the price, really really beautiful branding, all that stuff. maybe do some influencer [ __ ] right? Um, that's the way I've seen people do that. But if you want to talk about how to sell something that's commoditized, let's get This is the This is the mechanism question. So, this is not from me. I have to make that very clear. It's from a YouTube channel called Copy Squad. Highly recommend following them, watching their video on how unique mechanisms work. This does all the heavy lifting. Highly recommend that. So in this case, if I was selling something commoditized, you have a few kinds of mechanisms because I want to go into the mechanism because I truly believe that this is the single most important part in copywriting that everyone neglects. And I'll go into that a little bit deeper. Let's say I'm selling something commoditized. There's a very uh there's a very famous example here from the show Mad Men. They're selling cigarettes. Guess what? Very commoditized. Everyone's selling the same exact [ __ ] right? And so Don in the show, he was asking the CEO like, "What's different about your thing? What's different? What's different? Like how do you how do you make this thing?" He was like, "Well, I mean, we use the same ingredients that everyone else does, the same process, like everything like that." And he was like, "Okay, walk me through it." He's like, "Oh, well, well, we toast our cigarette, our tobacco." And he's like, "You toast it." I like, "Yeah, but everyone toast it." And he was like, "Who says that they toast it?" And I was like, well, and so now he was like, our cigarettes, they're toasted. That is an unspoken mechanism. That is something that everyone does if you're in a commodity market. It's something that is a part of everyone's process or product or service or whatever, right? But no one talks about it and you just highlight that and now that is your thing. Another example, another example of this, let me open up here because I had the examples written down. goldplated uh detectors, smoke detectors. And so there was another this is from uh Joseph Sugarman. So he was selling fire detectors, right? And the same thing like, okay, what does everyone what does everyone use? I was like, well, we have a goldplated like detector. And he was like, does everyone else have it too? Like, yeah. Does everyone talk about it? No. Goldplated. That's it's it's so stupid. It's so dumb. But that thing positioned them in front of everyone else in the market and now their competitors are looking at that they're like what the [ __ ] like I I'm goldplated like he's toast doesn't matter because they were first to that. So if I was selling something that's commoditized let's say let's say a piece of furniture let's say it's wooden furniture wood and let's say it's high quality right? What kind of grain is used in the wood? What kind of what does the grain pattern look like? What kind of wood are you using? Where's the wood from? Is it imported? Is it European? These are like some things like if it's imported, it's usually always perceived as a little bit higher value, right? Like is it imported? Like what does it look like? What do you use to assemble the thing? Why is it sturdy? Right? You can look at a bunch of different things there and just look at literally what's in your process. You'd be shocked at how many things that are in your process, in your product, in your service that you are not highlighting in your messaging. And if you find that one that could be like your big idea, some people call it big idea. I just call it like the actual like unspoken mechanism that could absolutely change everything and now that's your positioning. Yeah. So that's how I would sell something commoditized like that. Yeah. And you and so you're saying though that even though that is commoditized even though that everyone has that because you're first to market you win on it because you're first to position like that. Interesting. Yes. First to position. Exactly. Correct. Yeah. And so if you have something like let's say we do the wood grain thing like oh everyone talks about their wood grain thing or it's like um let's say it's the I don't know it's like the bolt pattern because everyone says don't sell on features. Everyone says this don't sell on features sell on benefits. It's toasted as a feature, but it positioned Lucky Strikes as like the top selling cigarette brand in the world, right? Every like goldplated as a feature and yet it outsold every other smoke detector on the market by like 10x because they use the mechanism in the right way. Yeah. Interesting. So there is a point where you do have to use your features. There is a point, right? And so that's how I would do that, right? Again, look at everyone that's in your market. Do some really good like market analysis. Obviously, make sure that you do have something unique and highlight it. Like really highlight it, right? Don't just have it in your bullets, in your copy, under your description. Highlight it. Put it in your headline. Put it in your ads. Right? That's how I would do something like that. Oh, the sauce is going to get real. Number three on here. That's super. I'm like thinking that for our stuff, and I'm sure I'll talk to you offline about this, but I'm like, "Oh, there's some very obvious ones for our stuff." That's like, oh, hell. Um, yeah. Um, all right. You talked to us about create uh creativity and ideiation in copy. I read one of your landing pages a while back and that [ __ ] was good AF. So your creativity and ideation process for copy. Okay. I wish I could give I wish I could give people a structure. Um I really wish I could give you like a set of like like a formula checklist to go by and be like okay so this is there and this is there and this is there. I don't have that. A lot of this at this point is just intuition because like I've written just I've just written so many sales letters. I've been in these markets. Like I've seen how the biggest people operate. Like it's just intuition at this point and like I've done so many split tests on like different structures and formulas. Like okay here's let's say I'm writing a brand new sales letter and let's say I'll use the business funding. Actually I'll dox I'll dox it. I I'll dox my I'll dox my uh my my kind of like awareness positioning here and it's okay because you can copy me but you can't copy the reason why I do something. So we're selling business we're selling business loans, right? Everyone sells business business loans. Um I'm going to do a modifier mechanism here. So I'm looking at the market. What does everyone say? What is everyone selling? Selling loans capital. Some smart people are selling growth capital, right? Some some smart people position it as growth capital, right? And so I'm looking at this, I'm like, okay, what do people believe? What is the belief that people have about the thing that I'm selling? I would start there. Well, no, start with your market research, your basic market research, of course, first have the fundamentals, but then start with what do people perceive about the thing that I'm selling, right? What beliefs do they have? What limiting beliefs do they have about the thing, right? And what are the perceived solutions around the thing? So, everyone around business loans believes that you need a bunch of collateral, right? You need a perfect like credit score if you want to get like I don't know um lines of credit or like 0% interest credit cards like whatever something like that, right? Um people believe that it's a hard process that it takes a long time, right? People believe all these things. So, okay, those are all my negative beliefs around the thing. Okay, how can I flip that? And I'm going to give you an example from a sales letter that I wrote about marketing. So this was in a segment targeting a niche that I had never heard of the term attraction marketing before because and so I was like looking like okay everyone's selling everyone thinks that it's hard people hate ads. People do all this stuff and you try to sell Facebook advertising it doesn't work because everything's saturated. Everything's noisy. No one's buying anymore. The auctions are too expensive. Blah blah blah. How do I flip that into a positive? Attraction marketing. I'm not bothering people, I'm attracting them, right? And so I wrote that sales letter. It did really well. I had to look at the market and like what people believe around the thing. And so let's say I'm doing that for business loans. Okay, what if there was something that where I could add some exclusivity into there where I was like, hm, I can get you approved for XYZ very fast, the best terms, right? Everyone says that. How now? How can I do that? What if I told you that I'd h I had some insider relationships? This is really funny because this is the this is the unspoken thing. Everyone does. Everyone does, right? No one's talking about it. So, I'm going to use this angle at from like insider reps, right? Relationship funding, right? Insider banking relationships. Okay, now we're getting a little bit interesting now. Now it's getting saucy. Okay? Because now all of a sudden from that from that now I can paint now I can further differentiate myself. I can say I'm going to get you these great terms right I'm going to get you like this great capital allocation right because I have these insider relationships and now I can go into hero's journey. How did I get that right? Why does this matter? Right? And I can kind of now that I just have that I can branch out and I can structure I can kind of create all these other elements in the copy. Yeah. That's so interesting. Like Yeah. Yeah. That's so interesting. I mean, continue, but yeah, continue. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Because copy like if you're writing a a VSSL, right? Like or you're writing a landing page, it's like all structure, right? Like you have your open, you have your lead, your lead type, you have like your your hero's journey, you have your need problem mechanism, your like solution mechanism, you have your offer, and you have your close, right? It's always easiest to go from bottom up. This is something that Allan talks about a lot, right? I didn't even realize I was doing it was like bottom up. So always close, offer and heroes and then you just go up the cycle, right? But I found that a lot of the times if you go mechanism first, the rest kind of falls into place. Mh. Because what a lot of people don't realize when they're writing copy, if you sit there and you're writing a sales letter, you're typing out a sales letter and like you have all these elements like you have your little check box. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. And so you write it all out and then you read it and you're like, damn, it's clunky. This is really [ __ ] clunky. Why is it so clunky? And it's because you have not established a series of ideas that the prospect has to agree with first. Right? Because we forget a lot of the times that copywriting is writing. You have to write well. And the way that you write well is by expanding on an idea and then summarizing the idea and creating an open loop to another idea. Right? That's the way that you have to do it. And if you start with the mechanism, if you start with what you're doing, how you're doing, why you're doing it, a lot of the times the rest falls into place. And so to answer the question of very roundabout way, that's how I get like kind of creative or idea in copy. Another way, if you just want like really really tactical, like let's say you're scripting ads, like you have an ecom brand, whatever, and you're trying to script ads, dude, go into a market that's completely unrelated to your thing. If you're if you're in D TOC right now and like you're in ads library and like you're looking at all these direct response offers, go look at info. Look at info. All right. Like open up, dude. Open up MSNBC. Scroll down to the to the to to where everyone has the um uh those what are they called, man? Um the ads there that are that are on the page. Yes, thank you. Native. Jesus Christ. All the native ads, right? Look at those. Look at the headlines, right? Look at the images. Look at those. Look at different channels, right? Because for native they have to click. Like that's their whole thing is like if they have to the the headline has to be good enough for them to click through. Get your ideas from there. Like I have a massive swipe file purely from native ads, right? Interesting. And so go always like if you're just too entrenched, sometimes you're just too in your thing. You're too like you just need to get creative. You need to like take a bird's eye view. Look at other niches. Look at other channels. Other channels is huge, right? And get some inspiration from there. Yeah. No, that's super helpful. I mean, sorry if I cut you off in the middle there. Our video gets choppy, so no one knows comments because I cut you off. Um, but no, that's uh No, it's all good. Extremely interesting because you do have a process, right? You do have a process and it's like it does come as intuition now for how you do it. But before we get to the next one, just offbeat a little bit, but like where where's the highest leverage opportunity that you could be applying this? Cuz like again, I'm not super well versed in this land, but like it sounds like you really know your zone of genius in this. Like is it like an agora? Is it like uh you know one of those because it sounds like you've done a lot of things which I think like that that's kind of my model too is like I did a lot of things before we did this one big thing or whatever that's just you know big in terms of size compared to the other ones if nothing else. um helped me like skill stack for sure, but I definitely could have taken one further. And it sounds like you're taking a lot of these like this. And so is this like funding thing? Is that one have the return potential for you for this skill that's like really high in comparison to the other ones? And like is there a higher like where's your journey looking like for that? That's a good question. Um I think part of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it is a kind of a byproduct of my negative heristic. So, I've always kind of done this like like I've always been around in like every industry and just like playing around like getting a client there and then scaling one then in the agency we never niched down. We had everybody like literally any do you sell something? Cool. You're a client. And the wild thing is that it worked. It's the wild thing is that we actually got results. And so I've been in all these different industries. The reason why if you're a copyriter and you have like that skill set and that's what you want to operate in and that's the only thing that you want to operate in then yeah 100% go apply for an Agora like a copyrighting position at Agora right like work your way way up to copy chief right like maybe you can be like a CMO for like one offer right I think at a certain point I've fallen out of love with info I won't lie um part of it comes from I I had when I was doing like my freelance thing I I had a bunch of coaching clients and info clients um two years ago who are working a job now like it seems to be so much of the case like we can point to several big guys who've stayed who have longevity but like let's look at those a bit deeper Tai bro he launches 10 offers a week right like and like every every [ __ ] week it's something new he has to right like Grant oh my like Grant's is very like my god the operation he's built is insane. But he has his 10x ventures. He has his 10x like for the for the local stuff. He has his like internal like capital raising thing like the real estate like all that stuff. He he has to do a million things at once. He has to do the seminars. He has to do these things, right? And I think at this point now seeing all of this I'm looking at industries that can stand the test of time. People need money and they will always need money. I've seen this industry. It's very unsophisticated in terms of how they generate pipeline. Everyone like MCA like MCA shops have floors, massive floors, right? Line of credit guys rely on referrals, right? If I can go in and run paid ads, which I have, um I was getting like $15 cost per qualified leads from business owners who are making $150,000 a month. Pretty solid if I have that skill set. Like, oh, okay. [ __ ] All right. Right. That's the key. And that's what I that's what I've been talking about too on this. Like I'm going to get you to re fall in love with info because it is it's the it's the broken part of info, right? Or not the broken part, that's that's that's crude. But the it's the coach to coach to coach side. It's that like you do it. You take your skill set and whether you call it direct response or copywriting or the the info business and coaching model in itself, you can look all the way down the funnel or the whole model and if you apply it to an industry that's not internet marketing or like make money online or whatever. It is so beautiful and so simple in itself, right? you don't have this business operation that you know funding for example that has which I'm not which there's no disc but like you know it has way more moving parts and it has like it's real business not an offer and like 99% of info businesses are offers or multiple offers that becomes a brand that has like you said all the offers versus the ones that can stand the test of time that can start maybe as info coaching and transition into something that still in itself the model is you're selling info or coaching and this is no [ __ ] on MMO this is no [ __ ] on like we're in, you know, I'm in talks right now of how to do this in a way that I feel is clean that's like a way to cherrypick essentially the ones that I think are like real like businesses and have opportunity like legs. But you're so right, like taking the skill set and applying it to a little vegan company or I use the example I hear all the time of the guy who applied the skill set to his mom who had a knitting blog or like YouTube channel and next now they've gone to this and they do like whatever I don't want to misquote but like hundreds of millions a year with this knitting thing and have an entire town that they're from in the middle of nowhere that people travel to because it's the knitting capital of the US and it's like you can take these ideas so much further and she was selling essentially there's e-com and physical products, but like that was the evolution. It was her talking about knitting, then it was like, you know, like it's crazy. So, it's I think I think you're right. I think it's the skill set. And now that's what I was kind of asking is like where's the highest leverage for that skill set and it sounds like you've stacked a lot of the skills in that realm of like DR and like that game, which you only get through doing it in all these different buckets. But like yeah, like hopefully you have and we don't have to dox your your setup with those guys, but like hopefully you have a meaningful size of that because what you're doing I do is a huge lever. Yeah, a huge lever. Yeah, I I won't I won't go into um I won't go into specifics because that absolutely could do. Yeah, you don't need to. Yeah, I I I will say that we have one of the best terms with our originators in the market, at least of people that I've spoken to in this industry. And so we want to talk about like economics, right? Because you love economics. So tell me what you think about this. Um there are a few ways to to obviously to to grow the business. I can cut kak in half, right? For example, like I can like me as a marketer, right? I'm a marketing guy. So I can cut CAC in half, whatever, blah blah blah. If I see that in an industry like, okay, I have to stay within XYZ CAC and like my sales cycle is this and then blah blah blah this and so my clos rate has to be or or since I'm a brokerage and I get a commission on the allocations, I can just have a 40% higher allocation as my commission than everyone else in the industry. And now I have so much more to play with on the CAC side because of that. And so I can kind of like not that I'm going to like mess around, but I can kind of mess around and not be perfect on the acquisition side and have some some, you know, leeway to play with. I can do that, right? And so that's how I've kind of played this out. Like if you look at a lot of MCA shops right now especially like they give their reps 50% commissions sometimes right on their 10%. Right? 60 we don't do that. I'm not going to dox exactly how much we give in like a comp plan and like in the structure like all that stuff but we don't do that right we have a model that is very very healthy for us on the P&L side and the reps love it too because they don't have to outbound dial. they don't have to hear like [ __ ] you like you know blah blah blah all day right and so I can play around there and so I'm looking at that I don't know if that's the right framework I would love to hear your thoughts on that because again I'm not I'm so new to operating dude so new to operating like we scaled just like internally like we we got the funding offer to uh 50,000 just topline uh in 27 days off of like basically no ad spend like the returns were insane um but we have a couple offers I can walk I can walk us through like later I can walk us through like offer stack and like where we're liquidating like what our monetization is. I can we can we can walk through that. We can walk through that later but I want to hear your thoughts on that. No. Yeah. I mean I don't know enough about the space just off the rip. So this is like opinion only but as long as because lead lead quality and the ease in which or the efficiency that someone can do their role. It's like the path to money, right? It's like if you have a rep that's making 20% versus a rep like we're talking high ticket sales. You have a rep like a very there's a perfect example inside the info whatever space they have mercenaries they call them. So it's somebody so your normal your normal sales rep super simple and like basically classic is 10%. Let's just say that's like very very common in the space is 10 and then maybe like thresholds or they get up in cash collected amounts and then they reach 10 to 12%. That's like around the range. There are reps that are 20 25% that you hire on that you don't feed at all. So they're essentially a full stack mercenary and they pull people from the CRM. And this is better for guys who don't have like full machines where they have setters already doing this and all that, but like like this would have been perfect for us back six months ago and I didn't even know it existed. And I've talked to someone since that that was talking about this and they're like, "Yeah, they'll pull three, five, 10 deals a week depending on the warmth of the leads for sure." But like they get 20 points on that because you would have never had them or you would have hoped that they saw, you know, a retargeting or an email or something and pulled themselves back in. But these people were able to like snipe them and full stack do it. So a setter who did this is maybe gonna make three to five points. But a full stack person here, you're going to give them the whole pie. So it's 15 20 points. So in your example of as long as it as long as the volume plus like the percent maths out is really what it is to where they are making. We like you know we pay above market it hurts the P&L. Yeah. Like we do that kind of in a lot of places. Uh we try and be competitive but like we always try and keep cost down. It's that game. But like if they are with the volume that they get plus the like ease of close that the math nets out to them making call it 40 grand a month because the top dogs make 500 in the space like you're all good. You could give them 10% if your leads literally were just clo like you know they were CS calls where you just like signed them up right like it's it's a consumption quality game. So that's my opinion is the volume plus the times the percent equals whatever they get paid. As long as that math is mathing, you're like in the money. And it doesn't matter if it's if market's 50 and yours is 20 because if you have the hottest leads possible, they're still doing the volume to where it makes sense. And that's where you have to like play with comps and stuff like that in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. Thank you. I I got into like, bro, just you saying that I felt like I was watching the YouTube channel. Like when I watch you like I have you open and I have like a notes pad. Like I literally got into that mode again because like the stuff I I need to learn all this stuff. But that's that's good. I'm okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. There's just so much in Yeah. detail and like in ink like whatever around that that's like Yeah. It's very specific. It's very specific to your use case and just to blanket it is maybe not a good answer, but I think that that works. But let's keep moving through these. We got we're on only on number seven of 29 on this. Uh Jesus Christ. Where are we at this one? We spend 5 to 10k a day on paid traffic. What do you spend a day? What's the most you've ever spent in a day? Before I continue this, the most that I've ever spent of my own money embarrassingly low. The most managed Yeah. The most that I've managed The most that I've managed per day was 100,000. Wow. And it was not This was not like through a full calendar year. It was a thing that was seasonal. It was Q3 they were ramping and so they had that spend there and then your normally their thing is like anywhere between like 30 and 40 but it was 100k period they were just doing they just like spent a million bucks on R&D for a new thing and they wanted to really get it out. They did their market research, all that. And so I was in charge of a lot of calories. Hammer. It was it was that period of I think it was like seven days where I got maybe two hours of sleep every day and aderall wasn't enough. I literally took methamphetamines to stay awake and work. So like, okay, I have a different experience of this. Uh I have a bunch of different experience of this. FYI for everyone. But okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Uh, dude, the most I've ever spent, like you saying embarrassingly low, like I've probably spent four to five grand of like my own out of whatever money that was like random testing some ecom drop ship or like affiliate link thing and then my ad down or I blow something up and then within the company, well, that's not true because I've actually managed spend that was up to like 25k a day for ACA like a year ago. But they literally handed me everything and we're like, we can't watch as many ad accounts as we have. Will you just like launch these and watch them? And I was like, yes, I can do that just for fun. And that was similar. I was getting up at like three in the morning because the ad account was on a European time zone. It was a whole thing. Like it was it was one of those games. But yeah, that's hilarious. But yeah, we I mean ours I think we've only max spent probably 35 40 in a day. Uh when we were like heavy kind of doing stuff and testing, but again I'm not buying right. Co-founder is up to 20. Wow. The co-founder that's good that the co-founder was in there. That's so important. He's a sicko. It's why we were able to do what we did early is because of visibility in copy and and like I built the funnels and stuff like that for sure. Like cool. That's tech piece. You can hire someone on Upwork for that. Like the messaging, all the copy, uh creative review, he wasn't actually making them necessarily, but like creative review, we always outsource that. And then the actual media buying, he was in every course. He was in every community. He had done it prior in some drop ship games and made a bunch of money just like messing around. And then Quinn came into this. Yeah. He spent up to 20ish, probably more for us a day every day. Was was when you were because you mentioned a lot on on uh on the channel that like acquisition broke at a certain period. What was it when you were at at those peak spend like peak daily spend times? Was that when it kind of broke? Yeah. Close to I mean it was around there call it you know within a 3090 window. Um but also at that time we weren't spending. We weren't spending. So we had done at that time we had brought in basically like a lead genen media buyer to do meta and then like a YouTube person Google person to do Google and it was like okay but their contract we never really had a we never had a marketing division because we were dumb and didn't know how to like hire for manage and he did that stuff and had enough oversight that he managed that and then I do all the funnels and tech and tracking and everything. So, we're like, why do we need somebody? Like, we're just going to cash flow this thing and never like build it out. And and then we got to a point, excuse me, uh we got to a point where we hired agencies. We had like a like ripcord style, like aggressive agency that actually did really well for us that like lives in the info coaching style space. um and did well for us for a while, but like it's almost like and again, no [ __ ] on them, like we hit some some of the higher peak months uh when they were coming in on it. Then it felt like they were not fully like in the accounts enough for where we were going with size. And that's on us as much, you know, as them, right? Where it's like we were navigating that. And then we moved off that, tried to go internal again, basically broke, hired another agency. And that's when and again, not on the agency, but like we had hammered this funnel. We had already done 20 something this year in that funnel of last year. Yeah. And it was just kind of like it was everything right. It was like the account needed to be run like info and coaching and consumption meant to be run not like ecom but then it was also that the funnel types and the acquisition methods needed to be updated. We needed multi. We needed different VSSLs like on front end. We needed a low ticket. We needed like more ecosystem on the front that we didn't have. Uh and it exploded and we were paying them 13% I think. So, we're spending a million bucks a month paying 130 grand to an agency that did everything. They did all creative and buying, but like it was not great. And we gave I mean, they gave us a lot of shots. We gave them uh them a lot of shot. Like, it was back and forth. We changed everything with pixels and track and all that at the time because something broke there. We had never really properly split test. So, we're throwing scripts on page to try and split test stuff. Like, we introduced a lot of variables uh when things started to break that but your CPA is going like this. your ad bill is going like this and your agency is a percentage across there but like you know is also climbing. It's like we were burning money in every bucket you could. So it was like we just pulled the rip cord did it ourselves and then since have built out these other pieces and we have like sickos for these individual but marketing team is whatever almost like two hands basically now and they are they've rebuilt the entire structure like you could say they have the same results if you look at like cost per call or whatever and cost and like volume but how it's structured and the ability for it to get the next layer of scale under this new leadership and team is like night and day. Yeah. Night and day. So that's Yeah. So that's our tangent. I want I wanna I want to like dive deeper into like outsourcing versus in-house, but I know we can do whatever we want. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we do have three hours, so like we can we can we can get into 45, but I'm good. Yeah, we can go we can go now or later. I mean, we're good. We're good. So to answer this one, what he asked and then we can bounce around is if you're spending they're spending five or 10k a day and how do you handle volatility because they'll have 10 negative 10% to 50% plus. I assume he's Oh yeah, right there he's talking CPA models of sending to VSSs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to actually because I asked him a bunch of questions in the Twitter thread right here. I have ADHD so I need to write everything down. So I'm going to open up the thread right here because I asked him a lot of questions. He has his answers here. So yeah. So I asked him, this is going to be a bit more in depth. So he said his uh blended new customer rowass across uh 30 days he said um made a total [ __ ] show around 6% um don't know 6% NCOS it doesn't really so I'm not sure what he was trying to say there uh 6% NC when he's saying CPA model he's meaning let's just I mean you're going to know better than me but are we assuming he runs call it affiliate ecom or something or affiliate model where it's 100 looks like it yeah okay so he spent 100 grand and made six Yeah. Yeah. I I that's I mean that'd be insane if you're spending 100 grand, you're making six. That would be crazy as [ __ ] I mean, okay. Okay. Um prim's 20%. So, okay. So, the volat volatility window that he's looking at is daily. Um which that's kind of first thing right there. So, I told him that usually when you're and actually Eddie mentioned this as well. um when you're looking at these this volatility on a daily basis and you can go by hourly is like you just go into the Facebook view you can see that during certain hours of the day right you get like higher OS lower R OS like more clicks less clicks like clickthrough rate can be as much as like 80% lower like during certain windows of time within the day and so if he's looking at that hourly then that's what I would look at but if I'm if I'm going to analyze performance and especially these big swings like that um he said like weekly and monthly are also volatile obviously if you consider 10% % versus 20% was like 100% swing. Um, I would really look at what are you doing during like let's like pick a window. So, let's say we pick a 7-day window because daily is way too short. You don't know like that's not even enough at that spend to get a statistically significant test through if you're doing like a test. We launch a new creative that's just not enough, right? So, I would pick a look back window and then be like, okay, this is what we did during this period from I don't know May 1st through May 8th. This is what we did. And so like now I'm looking at that window. We launched a new creative we launched a new creative concept that was around X persona with this angle during that period. And now we're seeing that our CTR let's say here because he was saying his CBR is the problem which leading indicator like I need to know those. Let's say like our CBR is like 20% less or whatever right doing that look back window. So we need to go back and test something different. That's like the number one thing which is super duper basic and like you talk about this a lot is just having visibility into what you're tracking and why you're tracking it and like understanding correlation because he literally said here the sale is in the VSSL so it's not like ecom where your creatives advertorials etc should do the heavy lifting if the sale is in the VSSL and like let's say I'm assuming he said he runs outbrain so you're doing clickbase so let's say the ad is obviously like with the with the graphic and the the headline all that stuff but let's say within your VSSL since that's your entire entire kind of like sales mechanism there is your VSSL. Um there's a million things to test within there. Treat it like a funnel, right? Because like you have your lead type, right? Are you going direct? Are you going indirect? Outcome based, promise, promise based, offer based, right? Like promo based, like you do a million things there. And then you have the structure of the VSSL. So you should be testing those. You should be testing that all the time. Um you had um God, I'm I'm really horrible with names, but he was the the branded drop shipping guy. He was talking about this how he test like 20 V. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 20 VSSLs or something crazy like that, right? Within I don't know what period I forget, but like he tests a bunch of VSSLs. And so that's the one thing if you're seeing this volatility. That's the one thing that I would look at. I don't know enough about Outbrain or like any like demand based platforms to or um DSPs to to like really give you any insight onto the actual media buying. Yeah, I've never bought media there. Um, I'd like to talk to someone who has, but I couldn't tell him like campaign structure and like blah blah blah all that stuff. So, I couldn't tell him there. Like the main thing is if you don't know what's going on within what period, if you can't tell me that between May 1st and May 14th, we were doing this, we excluded XYZ placement on Outbrain. So, we weren't like showing up on these news channels. And because of that, I saw that while our click-through rate, let's say like decreased by whatever 15%, our conversion rate actually increased, right? Because like this is just better placement, better leads, better traffic. Then like that's the first thing that I would do like first of all because the answers aren't really there. Like tell me what you're doing there. There needs to be a structured way like just the basics like have data visibility and understand what you're doing and what you're testing. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean that makes sense. Yeah. Because when I've talked to some of these affiliate guys in lead genen in the past, it's like you will have this until you crack it, right? And like that's what I've always heard is like you're testing these different things like you're saying and mainly if you're just running to this their offer, it's like a little bit simple example, but let's use like bridge page and like clickbank VSSL, right? It's like you can only adjust the ad. I mean, you're media buying land basically, which is as everyone says mainly creative at this point. And then you can have your lander and as long as your lander has whatever clickthrough rate within this pocket, like you just kind of leave it. Let's just say simple. And everything is over here. Everything is like how many different leads are you swapping? And then all of a sudden you're going to get your uptick. And then it's like now how many different bodies are you messing with? And then your CT like until you get one that goes from five to 20 to 50 and then hovers around this 50% or whatever drops to 25 whatever the you know KPIs are. But that's exactly what we've heard. We we do probably 20. It's it's roughly 20 new ads a week still. So not quite high like you hear you hear some people talk like way crazier but I mean for us like we have some tried and true ones that have like carried the accounts as like as the CMO says like we overuse some of them and that's probably an issue. Um but yeah their new generation cycle is roughly that there's like 20. Okay. I would say um about the creative testing thing because this is something that I'm seeing more and more people be aware of is that volume doesn't matter as much as one quality obviously because like the whole thing that we're optimizing for here with like creative testing is your hit rate, right? Obviously it's like you want a high like the highest hit rate as possible. So just just so you're like you're not wasting money on on [ __ ] ads, right? with Facebook specifically and I can talk to Facebook more than any other channel because like I've spent some like I've done some like PPC right in like in the actual ad account but Facebook's my baby. So with Facebook they literally tell you we want breadth of creative in terms of difference in creative they need to be wildly different right so not just format not just change a hook because everyone goes hook body CTA right no and we're going to get to there's there's a question that was talking about this post um that I made uh I can't say the word that was in the first sentence of uh of of the of the post itself. Uh, the PG. All right. It's the naughty word. Yeah, it's the naughty word. Um, creative strategist people talking about awareness levels as if that's not marketing 101. So, I'm going to go through some of these things here in terms of like creative testing, what you should be swinging for and how wide your swing should be just for context. So, number one, are you separating your messaging to target different uh demographic triggers? For example, using traditional news sources to anchor your USM when targeting boomers. So let's say you have an older audience, right? Something that's very apparent is that they still trust traditional media sources. If they're on like a certain side of the political spectrum, they're usually very very very religious about that, right? So if it's let's say like you have the you know a bit more like right leaning whatever they love Fox, right? For example, like as a go a bit deeper, figure out what they actually love like what your buyers actually probably watch. But let's say you have that. So, now that I know that, I'm going to actually test, let's say, and this can get a little bit gray hat. I don't know, like people do it, you know, especially on like the the advertorials and stuff like that, like they try to structure like news sites or Yahoo, whatever. Um, let's say in your ad, I'm going to do a uh an AI avatar where it's a uh a news anchor and the color scheme in the background and the structure of the graphics in the background is going to look exactly like Fox News, but it's not going to be the logo or anything like that, right? So you don't get obviously get flagged, but the structure, the super structure is there, right? And they're going to be talking about the same thing that you talk about in all your ads, but you're changing that, right? The the the the delivery mechanism of the thing because you understand that your demographic probably trusts this delivery mechanism of a message of an idea. And so you're going to try that, right? Like this is getting like super like, you know, I've tested this. I've tested this. It works. Another one that I've tested really heavily is uh the other one, so uh using the common en enemy when targeting uh African-Americans. I'm half black, so I can say this and not be racist. Um when you're targeting African-Americans, a lot of the times we're talking about the catalyst, right? If there's a skin, there's, by the way, there's a um CEOs brand that my buddy Ben showed me that uses exclusively targets African-Americans. You see this in almost all of their ads. It's brilliant. You target the system, right? Because this thing of oppression, right, of being marginalized is a huge component of that demographic, of that niche, of that community, right? And so you want to highlight that in your ad, right? And be like, they don't want you to know this. They're trying to keep this from us, right? This whatever thing, right? To keep us under, then use their language, obviously, right? So things like that. When I talk about breadth, let's say you have a product, you have three demographics. Let's say it is, you know, um 50 plus uh conservative men and then you have African-Americans, right? And you have all this. Test those things. Put that in there instead of having like the same structure of ad for every single demographic, every persona. It's like, oh, I understand their desire and I understand what problem they're trying to solve. No, be very, very diligent about that. Be specific. Go deep. And that's what actually Facebook loves to see is that variance, right, in what kind of creative you're actually putting out there. And everyone says this with format. It's like, oh, the before and after, the UGC, the green screen. It's not just format because Facebook is literally finding you like pockets of buyers in the ad ID itself. That's why everyone talks about like copy your ad IDs, copy your ad IDs because it literally understands the bucket of people who are buying the thing or engaging on the ad, right? And so you want to take that and you want to dial it up, right? And you there's ways to do this where like if you're not sure if African-Americans are like a good a good demographic that like will actually buy your product, there's ways to do this cheaply. Like we have AI tools now, right? Like it's not that expensive to actually roll out a test, right? But if you want scale, true scale, that's what you have to do. I think you cracked that one uh for that person. That's Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. like our our CMO talks about that of having like because we were talking about it more so in structure on how to run these things like already doing that already doing some version of like wildly different kind of pieces but then the literal uh campaign structure of things of setting it up so they live in their own buckets so that when it goes out and finds it stays within there and then you can kind of keep that thread. Same thing with going multi ad account is like when you carry over and I'm kind of getting out of my lane here, but I'm also like just echoing what I've heard with our structure is like they'll move stuff into a different ad account completely or test something that's like way out here and not just oh yeah this ad exact copy and asset worked and now we're going to use it over here. It's like yeah that can work when you're not having an issue with performance but if you're trying to solve for that then going complete you know right side right field and doing that is is interesting. So, okay. I think that solves that one. Um, yeah. You have anything? Uh, yeah. I was going to say your your de your your demographic is um what's the age range that you guys target? I know it's women, but what's the age range? 40 to 60 roughly. 40 to 60 roughly. And that's where like all your Okay. Okay. So, if Yeah. In your specific case, like you guys I know your CM knows your like your guys' customer like the back of his hand. Um I love huge TAM markets. That's always been my thing. gargantuan tam because it's easy and again I'm lazy. I like to do what I, you know, I'm lazy. I like this. And so I have the flexibility to test all of these different things, right? But like if you're within that and you kind of already have kind of like a guideline of who buys this, I would just do that do that depth just segment that portion out because I'm sure you have like African-American women who purchase this thing, right? Like they care a lot a lot about like ancestral stuff, especially the older ones. Especially I know me because like I got aunties, right? Like they care a lot about like how my ancestors were doing this XYZ how they were optimizing health, right? And so if you just segment out your your your women into like at least just one more bucket and you can test that, right? And you can get like I'm telling you insane results like insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're currently having a version of that when you're talking like demo of uh different brand faces that exist at different ages. Um, just that alone and just like a different person is a different person. Uh, so doing stuff around that that also has different storylines that has, you know, that all bleeds back to the same thing. And the biggest thing we're like pushing to solve for now is congruency across that. So, example of brand face 3 being in ads that then go to brand face one being in the actual VSSL. So, so we like tested a ton of stuff when it comes to the actual ads and like what gets, you know, the metrics right here and then as they carry through it's one thing. Now we're going that further line and doing the throughput of a VSSL that matches uh you know messaging the emails that m like we're we're going down that. Um, but that's interesting you say that about like, you know, different styles because we've gone deep in other corners of the messaging with the one and now that we have multiple, it's like using those multiple. So, yeah, that's interesting. Um, all right. So, this next one on here would love to hear about your scaling strategies, how to go from one to five to 10K with paid traffic and how you're structuring teams so you're not doing it yourself. So, what does your team structure look like at at your current setup or is probably what I uh Yeah. How you're structuring teams. So, you're not doing everything yourself. I'm doing everything myself. I do absolutely everything myself. So, so I um yeah, actually a couple days ago. So, we hired a web developer for a couple of our landing pages and I was so tired of going back and forth with changes. I just logged into Framer and did everything myself. I am the last person you want to ask about delegation, leverage, anything like that. Last person because I will do everything myself. And it's horrible and it's a habit that I'm trying to break, but I'm not I'm like from video editing to landing page design, every time I outsource it, I can do 10 times better. And this is probably because again, I don't have the economics to support someone who's way better than me. Obviously, duh. Once we get to that point internally, that can be a thing. I can talk to you about the other organizations that I've worked in where obviously there were people 10 times smarter than me in their own lane. I wasn't managing the team, so I couldn't tell you how to structure a team. Um, I can tell you like our managers were like, you know, desilo everything. It was like like a big thing. It's like, you know, like a duh, like those principles, but I couldn't tell you how to structure a team. So, yeah, I think the Yeah, the piece on this No, it's important. I think we go into that on you doing it yourself and because Yeah. I mean, I'm I hired a marketing tech on Friday and I have done marketing tech from day one. Like, dude, I it's a it's a skill issue that I have as very much so as well where it's like being able to do it through people. Hormones, you had a video about this the other day is like the ultimate leverage. Yes, there's code. Yes, there's capital. Yes, there's content, media, whatever. But like when you can do it through people and then they have access to that as well, right? So like what your intentions or strategy or plan are having that done through people at the same or better than you level is the key there. Um but I think I don't know I feel like for you you're you're almost too and maybe it's because you're not loud enough about this stuff yet but like you know your [ __ ] and like you can structure there's another I talked about this on yesterday's I think pot but like my first ever internet marketing thing was uh Instagram shoutouts. I bought some random course on Instagram shoutouts that then you do an opt-in page and then you selfquidate with a ClickBank offer on the back end. Like dumb as simple as sorry not dumb necessarily. People probably crush it but like simple as can be. But what I didn't realize was then I had to email the list in order to make the money on it. Right? That was the whole point is you just mail the list, you do content and then affiliate offers and like the classic give give freaking take basically in this model. Um, and I didn't have the wherewithal to understand, and I promise this loops, but like the wherewithal to understand that I could have paid somebody as a percentage of, and there's ways to do a deal that wasn't I need to pay a copywriter five grand a month that I did not have very clearly at the time. I spent like $500 and I had like $112 in my checking account after. like I I didn't have the wherewithal to understand or to have the skill or the confidence or the history or the exper maybe who is better at you at just video editing and not pay them five or 10 grand a month. I talked to some of the biggest dog like that tell me the what they pay editors and stuff and because of their clout because of where these people live because of the stuff because of who they find through pockets and pockets and pockets like the person exists out there that either is the cost that is in alignment because of international talent or that you can broker a deal with as a percentage or whatever or an up to or a performance base that like your P&L can support it on day one because you have the experience and you have like the for no better word the clout like and you could do that right now. Yeah. It's funny because I literally was that kid. That was me. I was the kid that other people took advantage of because I had this thing and you know XYZ and Yeah, you're right. Yeah. I you got and you got you got paid or whatever, but you got you got to learn it. And guess what? Somebody else wants to learn the other people around it. And like that's the part of partners or talent or stuff that's there is like you have to almost be okay with like some of the lack of experience maybe, but like the awareness that they're trying to grow to a point that they can leave. But like you can use them during that. That is you is a great example. Someone wanted to take advantage or use your skill set for what it was valued at at the time or what you valued at at the time that there knowing that you were going to go out and do your thing after. Like someone who had that awareness already knew that that you were going to be there for six months or a year and they were going to juice it and like their economics worked and your earning slasharning value grew and you went on to the next thing. It's like that exists everywhere and I didn't notice that early and there's a time and place to hire for experience. Like that is something we fell short on is everyone it was everyone's PR every time we hit a new record month like it was all of our best and like now just now as of whatever 3 to six months ago we have talent that's come in that's done new like way bigger numbers and can just like plug in the systems and do this but it comes with a cost a very true cost real cost. So like you got to kind of dance those games in my opinion. Um, but yeah, you're clearly at the awareness level and like the skill level in this game and cloud, dude. I mean, you tweet and you get 50,000 on a thing. Like you could find somebody, do your video editing and just do your video editing and drop them in a Slack channel and like help them with some little side things and just find that and like start to silo those things out and then eventually desilo them because then you're at the mercy. But like you have to silo before you can des. Yeah, very true. Very true. Yeah, that's how do you how do you reconcile personally? Because I I I have this thing that I do and I I'm genuinely in love with what I do. Like it's a it's a level of obsession where I can't imagine myself doing anything else or I'd probably be like hanging from a rope, right? Like this I found a thing that like I want to do for the rest of my life, right? How do you reconcile with okay outsourcing the thing that you genuinely love versus doing it but then also not having the leverage? How do you kind of reconcile those two things? Well, the easiest answer is if I mean it's completely what you you have to start with the goal because you don't need le like an artist that paints for fun and just paints and never makes money on it but literally loves it is going to do that forever and like that's fine. Like there doesn't have to be just because we hang out in money Twitter or wherever and it's like oh these guys make 50 million or 200 whatever. It's like if that's not your game you don't have to play it. Like stupid games stupid prizes and like if you're going to get up to this position where you have to manage 50 people or whatever and there's ways around that too to get still get the same size but like you can design it however you want it. It's like start with the goal of like do you okay cool is it some number and why is it that number because you saw it on the internet or because like you know how your life will change or how you live in whatever freedom capacity or nice [ __ ] or whatever and then is all my opinion by the way but like and like backing out of that and then knowing that once you get there how do you want to then approach it with that leverage because if you seriously are like oh I love these video editing it's like you can go real deep in anything and that doesn't necessarily mean that like you can You know the guys that are the copywriters that love it so much that now layer some AI into it but still do it to this day. But instead of doing $1,000 VSSL, they do 100,000 VSSL, $100,000 VSSLs with 20% backs on front end and whatever. Like there's a monetization game that no matter how deep you go in your skill set that you can get paid for. And the next layer of that skill set is yes, having a team of people that do it, but you're the best of copyrightiting, but you have copywriters and like you still look at it, you still touch it, you still live in the world, but you have team that does it. you have leverage. You have AI tools that do it. You have leverage and like so it's it's again it's the dance of that game. It's like if your skill set right now is vast. It is vast across this direct response space. Like the business model could be agency performance thing, but it's like and you can go real deep in that. You can be one of these guys that takes 10 or 20% of revenue and do 10 million a month. Like that's not uncommon. And like I know I know a guy does that. Right. So like that kind of stuff and you can have such a leaning team so you're not really like a manager you hang out with your friends that like the con models aren't alignment. Maybe maybe it's you know truly split up in partners where like you're living the freedom thing together. Like I know tons of people like that and us kind of included where it's like we all win together, everyone gets paid together. No one person is like making you know 90% of the share and instead we all are eating from it. It has to be bigger is a big thing. you have three partners, you have to do three times the amount of profit in order for you all to live at that whatever let's call it 100k you want to make. Like you got to do 300 for you all to eat. Like simple math, but really real. And like does the business model support getting to there where all your lifestyles are how you want it? Um but yeah, dude. I mean you're right there. So it's all up to what you want. Like if you say you love the craft, the question is you love the game of this craft or do you actually like clicking the keys and doing that? You can do both still. Like again, you can do it really high leverage or you can do it with team and still have leverage. Yeah, video editing was not the best example to use in that because I I genuinely want to shoot myself. No, no, but like the copy game, the direct response game. Yeah, like that was literally my my crux of doing the affiliate and lead genen stuff. It's like I could even do the scripting and that was kind of fun for me but like not great. But when it came to doing the videos and swapping hooks and swapping like files, it was like not the move. And then I tried to hire for it and I was like doing all this other like actual stuff and this was like a little side quest and I was like I'm not [ __ ] doing this. I'm not paying someone two grand a month or whatever to like edit these videos and they're relying on me for scripts and like again the model works. I know guys who do hundreds of thousands a month doing it and have one editor and they still do the media buying and it's like 90 whatever percent margin on their team and then on their actual stuff is their 25% margin on affiliate lead genen call it a day and they crank it just wasn't in the model yeah that I leaned into. But like you could do that right now. You could make I mean we don't have to dox that but like you could be in the hundreds a month all day. you know the lead genen guys and affilate guys that do it with yes one to three offers or skew or whatever types niches and then have a media buyer and a creative and that's oversimplifying but like basically so it's funny because I I literally have offer I have about maybe 12 or 13 offers just like that structure in my DMs now because either from clients that I worked with and they know who I am and so they hit me up or like they see my content like dude like I'm doing like there's a guy that's like I'm doing 300,000 a month right now. Like I want to get this to the next level and like I know it like my my marketing like my cold my cold prospecting isn't isn't isn't the best. My media buying is not the best. I have a guy there but he's you know I want you in there. I'll just give you 20%. I said no. Yeah. You know, but I I know it's there and you're in and you're you're you're right there. And I mean if you see a higher upside or because that's what you're right is you're just choosing what vehicle because you have literally nine of them that you could choose right now and you have 15 of them in your DMs or whatever right like yes that's it's just whatever one. So if you think that this one is the one that you can have the there's the whole game of like the cash flow game the the time for cash but then there's also the game that is this exit value and all these numbers and stuff and in 90 999% of the of our game it's like that doesn't really exist but there are ones that do you know you know you and I both know the lead genen companies that have exited that went for 50 orund and something the huge ones that went for like way big numbers but if you're talking like kind of lean teams there's ones that have gone for mid mid eight figures and if you can get a piece of that like that's a game. Most of what we do though is optimized for what is your time or enjoyment of that time to what dollar? We're just playing a way higher stakes game than you know your $12 an hour at some, you know, restaurant. You're doing it at upwards of, you know, 510k an hour depending on how in it you are. Yeah. Yeah. Very true. Yeah, I agree. Thank you for that. Thank you. No, no. I mean, no, no. Again, these are all my opinions and we are so in the we're all in the trenches. Your perspective is invaluable. genuinely. Well, I appreciate that. Um, all right. So, structuring team, both of us are saying we're bad at it. Uh, next, obscure networks and channels that do well. So, not your normal meta somewhere with huge awareness. So, so large audience, but how like basically how Agora's end of America is structured. So, what is a network or channel that is outside of meta that still has this mass approach? Uh, no idea. No clue. I am I like for the literally for the past three or four years I've been exclusively meta and Google. I know some guys who I talked to a little bit who like if you want to talk about like what like like ad networks like when you're saying like networks and channels like ad network like I know guys who do uh uh like TV, right? Like I know guys who do direct mail, right? Like I I Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I haven't gone super deep into with them because I don't do TV and I probably that's a huge channel, right? Um, but I know it's working well for them. I know guys who are on Apploving, right? And it's working really well for them. Um, I think I know there's Okay, if anyone knows anything about this, and I'm completely bullshitting, just like let me know because I might be completely wrong about this. I believe from one of my friends who runs on the app loan, he had there's another app network that's like kind of like this like targeted bundle of apps that is like similar to GDN. So like the Google display network very similar and I think they leverage the same dist I think but it's like this targeted bucket. So you can go like only games that are doing XYZ to like I don't know 5 million AUM or whatever. Um and like you can like do like very specific ad placements there that are very native looking. Those are that's something that I know. And then like obviously I it's not underground like everyone knows what display is but it's still massively underutilized. Yeah. right? Like like massively underutilized in the vast majority of niches. Like you go again go to M MSNBC, click on one, it's and it's always like the huge like full page VSSL with no time. Like it's always it's just that, right? Like maybe some insurance stuff, but like it's it's not utilized properly by most people. Yeah. Um yeah, those are the only things that I could I am not an expert in this. Do you know I I wish I knew more people who were like deeply entrenched in No, I mean we run that'd be something to talk about. We run we run probably 70 80% meta now and the rest is Google almost right and branded and then there's some cold that we're trying to crack but we've never like full scaled into that. Um the other one like classic is just I bought a course when it was hot. It was uh the Geekout guys James and someone else. They had a nothing uh nothing but native I think it was called at the time and they did like a fiveday workshop that was like get the recordings and be on live and I got on that and like I literally didn't even I just didn't understand right I this is all like the journey of me just like should I try this or this or this and like our main thing was going like you know we just didn't lean into it enough at the time which I regret massively but I was just learning all these things and that's where I learned about postbacks and that's when I learned about trackers and like I didn't know that stuff existed and so like if I could pick the value I got from that. It was that, but those guys were crushing crushing. It was all about loading in 15 landers with 15 different dynamic headlines and 50 different ad creatives and then launching them on tabula and whatever else. And like people crush it in that game. Um, I don't know how that works for info. Like we still don't do that to this day, but like the media buyer uh gal that we had that was a lead genen one. She was very heavy and spend like 2 to 500k a day crazy [ __ ] for um the I forget the title of it, but it's like the the lawyer the claims that's like the long-term cases where they're getting like a ton of people. Um she was a media buyer for that and then she was also info buying for us which is like very different. Um very different. But she was talking like push for example like they run all this stuff on push traffic and like I don't know that game. I don't like I don't know. So, I don't have an answer either directly, but yeah, there's obviously obscure networks out there. I don't And the big ones obvious if you can if you can crack them, they have the the size and the scale. Um it's just being able to crack them with the different funnel types, I would assume. And obviously the creative. Yeah. Yeah. I would um I guess like whoever answered that question like look into also like programmatic guys like I don't know like just do some googling there. I know there's a subreddit I a few posts on there like r/p programmatic. There's a lot of guys on there like maybe DM them like ask them a few questions because those guys are usually operating they they have to operate within like all of these things. They're programmatic ad buyers. So I guess them talk to them. I have no idea. I wish I knew. Yeah. All right. So ripping. Same. Uh how do you deal with weekly fluctuations specifically when dealing with CPM? What does your retargeting look like for people that are more bottom of the funnel? So again back to the fluctuations with stuff like CPM. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, CPM specifically is interesting because um I've gotten as high as when I was uh with the funding funnel when we were doing like the the 50k in 20 something days. I had as high as a $230 CPM. Guess what? It was still massively profitable. So, I was just like, "Oh, sick." And I posted the screenshot. I was like, "It's my CPMs." And I I just ignored it. Right? If you have if you can't do that then I would look at CPMs are interesting from my experience this is my experience everyone looks at this stuff differently so grain of salt from my experience what I've seen I can have a very high CPM and then my lagging my lagging metrics are insane like I can have a like a 6% outbound click-through rate right and like a 23% opt-in rate on the page which is literally what we ad on the $236 uh CPM campaign or ad. It was a 6% outbound click-through rate and a 23% opt-in rate. Not for a freebie, not for a lead magnet, not for a VSSL optin. These were leads who wanted to book a call and then it was like a lead form and then like a book a call page. Our book a call rate was 95% from the lead page to the book a call page. So, I was essentially getting 23% book a call rate, but my CPMs were 236 bucks. You think I give a single [ __ ] No, I don't I ignore. I was like, I don't care. Right. And then I had campaigns with like a 40 a $50 CPM, which is still pretty high, but like it's all auction dependent. Um, and they were getting horrible, like horrible like 1%, you know, like out on clickthrough rate like 15% off, whatever. Um, so a lot of the times when you see a really high CPM, it's because of your estimated like your E in your E, there's something there. you do have your your um your revenue per CPM as like an estimated thing in Facebook's like model. And so it'll look at that. It's like, "Hey, here's what we're estimating." Like your your um uh your uh quality score is super high, like super high. Your engagement score is insane. So guess what? We're going to charge you more because we know you're making money, right? Like it could be as simple as that. The traditional answer is if those things are not looking good, then Facebook is penalizing you for giving the audience a bad experience on their platform, right? They're not engaging with the ad because Facebook doesn't care about you as everyone thinks, oh, Facebook wants more people to spend money on more ads. No, no. They want more people to spend more time every day on the platform. And if people are not seeing engaging ads, and then that's then that's not going to happen. A very easy way to circumvent this is to engagement hack your ad. So like everyone like people and people say this all the time is like make your ads format your ads and optimize your ads for engagement. So a couple hacks with this um similar with YouTube where through plays are very important like on the organic side like on the organic side for Facebook because ads and organic run off of the same recommendation engine. Um, so if you look at your your hold rates, a very easy thing that you can do with your ads, look at Tik Tok shop. There was this one format where it was like, "My dad is a uh top paid neurosurgeon in XYZ." And he says this and notice the chick, she was like, she was cutting vegetables. She was doing something with her hands, right? She was doing something with her hands, like grabbing stuff, doing something like that in the background, right? I took that and I applied that to an ad with a UGC creator that we had that was she was already really like crushing it for us cuz she was Oh, she was hot. Um, so she was crushing it for us. And so I said, "Do a more native thing. Zoom out and I want you to do the same thing. Cut a cantaloupe. Cut a cantaloupe on your thing." And the everything else in the ad was the exact same. Same structure, same script, everything. The hold rate went from we already had it was pretty decent. It was like 20%. Went to 43%. So it more than doubled just from having that. And so I've learned some ad hacks. Hack number two. If you're doing a talking face ad, put some [ __ ] on your face. Like grab like I'm not joking. Grab dirt or something and smudge your face. I have tested this. Same environment, same everything. Dirt on your face, hold rate is higher. I've tested it. It works. I believe it. I believe it. There. So, there are these things. And of course, when your hold rate is higher, usually you'll see your CPMs go down. There are cases where it doesn't. And if it still doesn't after your creative is really really good and it's engaging and you can just tell by your hook rate and your hold rate. Sometimes people report ads. If someone reports your ads, you won't be able to see it on the front end. You won't be able to see it. Guys who have like insider rep um I'm sure you guys have like insider I don't know if we can dox this or not. If if if you want to say um if you have like insider reps on Facebook, there's like a dashboard that you can see where it's like actually everything that's flagged on your account and that's like kind of negative. It's like in this little yellow. Okay. Sometimes if you have an insider rep like they can show you that but it's not available for us normal people, right? It's like only for the VIPs who have that. Um you can't tell if someone flagged your ad. If someone flagged your ad and you notice that like for let's say I don't know a pretty long period it's an evergreen ad really stable CPMs out of nowhere just spike then someone probably reported your ad. What you can do there. Yeah. Some people some people say like and I'm not entirely sure either what's kind of like what's the actual deal with that. Some people say it's like the ad account or or like the Facebook page is cooked, right? Like like now you have to like test another ad account or another. I I haven't had that. I haven't seen that really. I don't know. That could be the case. Um but what I have seen works pretty well is that ad that has super high CPMs, take it off, wipe the metadata. And there's there's some tools that you can use to wipe metadata. Y and you can do it as simple as like mirroring it and then changing the saturation after you after you wipe it. So like Facebook visa as unique and just relaunch it and like for me at least like seven times out of 10 like that's worked like I if I've ever seen like that huge spike in CPMs where like for whatever reason an ad has just fatigued and I'm like I know this ad is really good and everyone's always like let Facebook decide no I I want to have some control. Like if that's the case then a lot of the times you can just do that and relaunch and it'll be fine again. I don't know why but it just works. Yeah. Yeah. I've definitely heard that. And then the initial point you were saying about we have an unconventional kind of setup where a lot of our stuff is purchase optimized even though it's a call funnel just because for us for the longest time it was just so much volume that you know it's hundreds and hundreds of calls a day let's say um and we didn't have anything filtering those to what is a quality call or not especially that happens on page for like a browser event. So getting a little more like technical into it, how we have since changed this and we have routing that occurs and certain things fire certain things different. So we can lean into the schedule world. We were doing custom conversions for a long time, but like to your CPM point, those are those can be high for sure, but like we'll have as crazy as like five times the cost per call like or more. And the cost the CPA is better than anything else. And it's like if you look at what that is on like cost per like the conversion rate on those calls for example like it doesn't even make sense sometimes like you're like because you know once you have a call you have a showed call then you have a closed call. So you have like your 2% you're dancing of your 50% show call it and your 30% close like 15% of those blended is going to close of those calls and then you'll have some of these sets that like call it 1 1200 and it's like 100%. like you have a,200 call and you have a,200 CPA and you're like what and there's like three that came through and you're like this doesn't even make sense. So like we definitely danced that that's what I was talking about like the structure change like our CMO has restructured this whole thing. So we have now stuff that fires on schedule that like works in a cleaner way. We have stuff that's purchased because now there's more signals but CPM and like what it costs per all to say like sometimes what you're saying is like not that relevant. It is not relevant if your cost per lead is $100 but you're targeting 20 if you're making 5x rorowaz on it. It's like who cares if you're if you have 150 amount of leads or whatever. So yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah yeah and I know this is way more relevant for for like what we do which is like lead call like there's other touch points like past that I know ecom guys like they have to be very diligent about like every single metric that goes on because they you know they just kind of have that they have to be very you know order one profitable all that stuff. So, I get it for the ecom guys out there. Like I get like your CPMs can be a massive thing that you're looking at, but yeah, like just look at like is your conversion rate on from that specific ad really like like really good? And I I've noticed this a lot of the times they don't know. They don't know. So like it's it's rare that they can actually attribute back to the ad the performance. Very rare. So if you're not doing that already, please go do that because my god that's really really important if you're not. And I've seen accounts like, dude, I've seen guys who spend so much money. You'd think, oh, you guys have UTMs and click IDs. No, you don't. Oh, okay. All right. Maybe do that first. Like, and they don't have it. And so, really, like, if you're not doing that, then do that. Attribute every sale, the conversion rate on all the funnels like to the ad itself. Please do that. Yeah, for sure. And then, and our example, right, is then doing that at the layer of the ad. So that what campaign or what optimization is that living in because that's so like we have attempted this is just so funny and I don't know how long ago this was and I refuse to say if it was recent but uh we are like looking at split tests on an opt-in page call it and one is running on schedule and one is running on purchase. The purchase ones, no joke, can have like a 5% opt-in rate, which is like the worst thing you've ever heard ever, right? And it's like, but it doesn't matter because how it backs out into calls and purchases. And it's like that's crazy to think about. So you're like, oh, just run that traffic at something that's not gated and it's like doesn't matter, right? Like the pockets that it can find, the algorithm can find on its own is like insanity and and that's obviously like the de the default purchase event, right? Yeah. So we have moved into Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's really funny because I was doing the same thing where not not like purchase but I was doing submit application versus schedule and because it's a default conversion event and like with Facebook's advanced matching it makes sense. It's literally find finding people who have fired that event on other people's sites and offers. And so it finds people who are most likely to guess what purchase, right? Or guess what? Submit application but not purchase. Just submit application, right? Or just schedule. And so it's really interesting. I've been now, which is kind of embarrassing that I haven't been doing this before, but I'm now actually starting to test the optimization event itself because everyone just goes for the default, but I'm now looking to actually test between purchase. I'm going to be testing purchase even though it's a call booking funnel. I'm going to be testing it, right? Because I want our like main thing is Yeah. Yeah. There's that whole game where it's like are you when you said earlier like Facebook knows how much money you're making or doesn't and you know you assume it's based on what you pass back to the pixel is them knowing right at some level. Um and you want that sometime like sometime you hear the people who game the system and make it so you know a purchase is passed in at $1,000 even though for you it's 5,000 so that the spread is different. Uh, for the longest time we did custom conversions just cuz that's how it was set up. And then when we did that whole switch over, we went to native. But I talked to guys right now that I've met through X and whatever that are like we have they basically set up call it C1, C2, C3, C4. And that's going to be your your classic like opt-in app booking purchase. Okay, let's just use those as example. Those four they've set up custom one, custom two, three, and four. And they even depending on they had this entire system that cooked for 90 days prior to when that health change came and they saw increased if not you know similar if not increased performance by optimizing for those and when they lost their purchase and they lost their stuff on their pixel because where they were categorized they continued to have the same performance they were still fine and like I know I know people who got waxed by not doing anything about this and we're just like oh we're able to continue to run on whatever schedule I don't even But like I know guys that got whacked by that and cut like a third and when it was a way around it that some of these agencies or some of these guys were doing correctly who knew how to like set these up from the get and again that's not something we personally dealt with but like I had two different guys that talked to me in DMs about how they set those up and I was like interesting interesting. So side tangent but yeah it's uh good on them for being um next one on here. Yeah, good on them. Exactly. Yeah. And I've also heard of horror stories of someone got assigned to it to make the change and didn't roll it out in time and then they had whatever like two days of data or I'm sorry, two weeks of data and then got cooked because they didn't they weren't able to cook the pixel long enough. Um and then they were running basically blind that then was feeding the new ones, right? Because it was like they didn't get the system set up in time to feed it and and and you know Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. That's the fun of it. Yeah. All right. down here we got is AI. That's the game is AI and direct. So let's just let's let's bucket this one as AI. So here are your high lever zones that you use AI right now. Yeah. So first is research. So I mean if you're not already, I'm sure 90% who are watching this have already used deep research either on GPT or on uh or with Google. I honestly honestly now especially now I'm liking Google's deep research more. like it does. It's just more a bit more depth. Um, so I'm going to open up the I'm still using the same exact deep research prompt that I me mentioned in my tweet here. I think it's to this day my biggest tweet. So I can share the prompt. Is that cool? Yeah, 100%. Okay. Okay. All right. Let me just find it here. should have had this on before bed here. Okay. Yeah. So, this is uh I took a bit of this from Stephan Georgu because he he tweeted this, but then I kind of added my own modifications. So, you want it to do if you're saying Oh my god, it disappeared. Sorry. One second. You're good. Sorry about that, man. Sorry. I should have had this. I should have seen that question here. We can do the We can do that. We just hit 130. So, anyone who's still here can hit the 1.5 in the comments. Just comment one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just Yes. There's a perfect gap. Yes. Okay. I'm going to have to Okay. Oh my god. All right. You know what? I'm not even going to mess around with this anymore. Here's the gist of If you want to If you want I'm sure you'll link my Twitter to the in the description if you want. I was going to say Twitter. Is that your pinned one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lowkey shout out. Just go to my just go to my just go to my Twitter. I'll pin it. I'll pin it after this video so that people can like actually go to it and see and it'll be like it'll be like the the full actual prompt. I have it in Google Docs. You can accidentally copy and paste. Um essentially it's a research doc that goes into a research prompt that goes into the first of all pain points like the basic ones, right? So pain points, desires, market awareness, market sophistication, very basic ones, right? Then what I really like that Stephan did was he did what is the uh I don't want to butcher this. What is the common perceived solution around the thing and then what are the core limiting beliefs he didn't say limiting what are the core beliefs around how effective slashineffective this thing is. So first of all, you have to give the GPD context as to what you are selling. So don't do any like copy. It' be like very specific. What do you sell? Very specific, right? I sell CMOS that has XYZ ingredients, right? And then like literally list out the ingredients. I want you to do deep market research about XYZ. And then you like literally list out the bullets, right? And then you want to prompt it and tell it, I want you to look at Reddit threads. I want you to look at Trust Pilot reviews of competitor uh websites and it'll find your competitor websites, especially Google. It's very good with this. GPT I found can hallucinate sometimes. Google's like really really good with this. It'll find the competitors um forums Kora and then it can do like YouTube. It does YouTube videos and comments and then I think it does some Twitter stuff but literally like make it source from like everywhere and it's going to compile you literally who your customer is, what beliefs they have. Like it'll map out a persona for you too. It'll be like this person is XYZ like age range and then gender and then it'll literally do like political beliefs and everything like like the whole entire thing with the full prompt because it kind of summaries it shittily here like with the whole prompt it'll give you all that stuff and it's like then it's hidden desires too hidden desires and hidden pains. So this is a big one. So let's say I'm going to take I'm going to take bisop as an example for the hidden desires thing. So people have hidden desires. They have the normal desire make more money. Then you have the hidden desire, right? And that is um I want to pull into my driveway with a new BMW M3 so my neighbor's wife looks at me and wishes she was with me and not her husband. Like those are the hidden desires, right? Hidden desire. I want to I want to make more money so that I can walk into work, walk into my manager's office, tell him [ __ ] you to his face, and then leave. Right? Like these are those hidden desires. And what this research prompt will will literally do is it will compile from like usually from Reddit. It'll compile all compile all these hidden desires and it will list them and you can make it just tell it to do like 20, right? And it'll list all of these things out, right? And then it'll also do the same thing just the inverse for hidden pains, right? Because you have your pain point, your main pain point, then you have your hidden pains or unspoken pain points as well, right? And so it'll do the same thing for both. That's the most relevant thing for me. And I tell it to pull direct quotes. That's actually a modifier that I don't have in the original post. I'll add a comment there like pull specific examples and then link the source, right? Because what I do as well is I have a little Chrome extension that does um Reddit thread like it'll it'll scrape the comments and the replies from a Reddit thread. So, I'll use that. I'll go to a Reddit. Yeah, I'll go to a Reddit thread about the topic. This is the most the the best thing that you can do if you're selling to problem aware or perceived solution aware. Look up, let's say, problem aware bucket one, solutionware bucket two. Uh, look up 10 Reddit threads from problemaw aware people who are saying like, I'm struggling with XYZ, like any advice, right? Open up every single Reddit thread, all 10 of them. Use the extension uh, scrape it all, right? Put it into a CSV and then upload it to a GPT like your main GPT copywriter project thing if you have that or Claude copyriter project like if you guys have that. If not, you can just upload it to a new chat, whatever. Um, and you can tell it like, "Give me give me the five most common recommendations from other people to solve this thing." Recommendations is the main thing because now you're now you're getting to the perceived solution aware. Now, when you're getting the recommendations from people, I was like, "Oh, this is what people think will solve this problem." Now, for solution aware, it is same exact thing. What have you done to do this? Right? And let's blah blah blah. You can do this for competitor reviews. You can do this for literally anything. And it just it takes like five minutes because you just compile scrape CSV upload it to uh to to chat or to claude and it just does it like that. I use it now I use AI mostly for ideiation on those two fronts. So what have people been doing? What do people think about this solution? What have they been doing to solve this problem? And what do people believe is the best solution to this problem right that they have? Again if I'm going for like problem aware, right? Like it it differs if I'm doing unaware. If I'm doing unaware, I don't I don't use AI at all. If I'm doing like an unaware um thing, it's like a very indirect lead type. I I really don't use AI because you just have to be like you have to be cracked to do indirect lead type ads. Like this is what those OG copywriters that was like their whole wheelhouse. Like you have to be so good. I avoid it when I can because you can easily mess up. I I really avoid it. You can very easily mess up and I'm pretty good at copyrighting. Um so that's how I use AI there. And then if you have um if you have a claude project immediately prompt it on a PDF or a rich text file usually so like your because you have your your memory like claude like the the usage like it kind of caps out really quickly. So convert in like PDF whatever to a rich text file. Upload a PDF of great leads by mass uh I forgot his first name but the last name is Masterson the book. Um upload that to it and you have to instruct it that this is the structure. This is copyrightiting training. This is the structure of how I want you to write these things. Upload that to your project and everything else is in the tweet that I made. I literally have like everything to train a cloud project on or a GPT project on for it to write you ads. I have found it does not matter how many files you give it, training material, how good your instructions are within the chat of and maybe I'm doing it wrong because I'm not an AI expert by by any means, but I still use it obviously. Um, the best is to shoot it a winning ad either that you've recorded or if you're going for like if you have some inspiration from like affiliates, you can just transcribe whatever ad that they're running. Look, I want you to write me an ad. You have to describe the entire ad to it. Basically, you have to really make sure that it understands. Follow the structure of the example that I'm sending now. And if you use like all the like all of my like prompting and instructing that instructing that I have in that tweet, it'll spit out like insanely good ads, but without that example ad, it kind of it kind of loses itself. It really kind of loses itself. I'll be honest. And then you just copy chief the the the outputs, right? And you know, that's how I use AI. I I I don't you there's some agents that um my co-founder is like really good at ops. He uses some like some agency workflows for like operations. I don't know any of that. I choose to ignore it, pretend like it doesn't exist and just let him handle it. Um but that's all that I use for AI when it comes to messaging and copyrighting. That's banger. Yeah. And that's what that's your pin tweet. Uh I'm going to let me pin it now. Actually, I was going to say pin it so before we all forget. Um but yeah, no 100% go check that out. I've seen that thread and there's a lot Yeah. I mean that's major sauce for the biggest one in the front end. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's my biggest 703,000 views and 5,000 likes and it's something like 20,000 bookmarks pin to profile. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, just check it out and everything's Let's keep moving through this. But yeah, that's uh that's unbelievable. I know our CMO when he came in he did like a full like you can't stop scrolling at the market research doc that he started with and put together and like he has found pockets of things that were like oh that's interesting and then same with uh he because we had so many assets already in terms of like because we can map back we have everyone's application ever so call it 500,000 applications that's cool but then I can tell you which ones of those applications purchased and then you can dump those or onboarding surveys or customer check-ins or whatever so like you have the customers. We have hundreds of thousands of data points on customer side of things. Like that's even how we we did it preAI, but that's how we landed on the age demo is because we didn't have an age demo that was like that. It was about the messaging to start and like broader and then as we saw who got the best results, who resonated with the messaging we were using the most. Like we found this pocket of age demo and then now leaned into it which increases everything across the scale like across the board because of you know congruency. But like before that we didn't know that and like that came out from looking at what is the age of our average buyer and like being able to pull that data and then now being able to take the thousand other like data points and put those into AI has been like oh that's an interesting they all say this phrase like this phrase has been used 40% of the time and things we're like oh that like all on the customer side not even on like the uh what does the market say it is what does our customer say and it's like that was really cool for us he did a ton stuff around there and found some gaping holes that we weren't doing and has leaned into those. So, I agree with you on that use case. Are are you or is he are you guys doing something where you have like the sales call transcriptions um that are like auto uploaded and then you can kind of like because you I'm sure you have like the lead scoring and all that stuff and then it can use that like by pipeline stage like close and then ACV all that stuff. you kind of cross reference the transcription of the of the sales script and then from that it'll pull yeah a light version of that. So we do we have so much going on and we had we were scaling so much that we actually did that first for like an analytics and like uh fulfillment aspect. So we did that with the actual coaching calls. So inside product uh was the first place that we did that and then we ended up rolling out for coaching and like or to coach the sales team we rolled out with uh zoom revenue accelerator which is like gong AI or whatever and they do that whole thing and it's keywords it's you can upload a checklist that you have that auto assigns to it. So it basically gets transcribed, has the video transcribed, and like within whatever five minutes you have a checklist that's like, did they take control? Did they set the agenda for the call and it's like yes or no? And you can choose radio button, you can choose how much. You can choose like how you want it to be ranked. But let's just say it's yes, no. The beauty of it though is it'll say no, they didn't. And you're like, okay, why? It gives you the snippet of what the AI spit out of like they didn't take control set the agenda because in the beginning the person was on their phone then moved to their desktop and then their cat was running around and this and this and it'll tell you that. So it'll give you the answer to why it chose that. So gong I think is like 10 times more intense than that and has more stuff but it's really expensive and we were like back and forth with our sales leadership and team and like how we were doing things. So we're like maybe don't put $100,000 into a software when there's probably some easier land grabs. So we were like, let's not do that. And then we ended up landing on ZRA because we already whatever we brokered a good deal where we already paid for too much storage and it's very low cost for us in comparison to what we were paying. Um, so yeah, so we use that right now, but like uh HubSpot just rolled it out as well. So HubSpot now natively inside there. I think you have to have co-pilot or whatever, but when your call recording shoots in, it now gives you an AI thing that's like so and so said they were going to reschedule a call for next Tuesday. This happened, this happened, like automated notes that come out that are AI. uh which I like a lot but yeah I mean we don't have to go into my world of AI but the marketing side of it definitely uses that sales uses that maybe another one uh the we're here to pick your brand um but yes there no no uh and then sales yes is used there and then fulfillment is used for analytics more so and like fulfillment like basically standardization making sure that things occur that are supposed to occur uh you know in infer on things like time and context next. So, yeah, we used it in a couple places, but nowhere near where we could or should. And then on the automation front, we just moved a ton of stuff from Zap to NAN and it's like $150 a month for that versus what we were doing, which was 4,000 a month or something on a Zap. So, yeah. Yeah, we've had some cost savings, but we're in the we're in the lie of rolling all of that out like a toz uh with a with an external company that we just contracted. So, I'm excited for I know that I know Matt Ryder talked about his um because I think there were he said that they were doing Yeah. Yeah. And that that Yeah, that's something that um Well, we'll get into that. We'll get into that after like all the all these question. Dude, I have so many questions for you. Jesus Christ. We'll get into that after if we if we have some time. But I haven't mentally not yet. Um here, let's try these ones are shorter. So, let's see if we can keep these a little tighter and then we'll see. Where am I at? What's one skill you wish you mastered earlier in your journey? Huh? Going to be a weird one. I wish I read more fiction earlier. Interesting. If I were Yeah. If I were to attribute something that I did to my ability to write very compelling copy, it was reading fiction. The reason why I believe is because when you read fiction, you become the person. You become the hero character. Their struggles become your struggles. Their pains become your pains. Their journey becomes your journey. You feel their fear. You feel their their pride, right? and you just become entrenched in their world. And that is something that you must do. It is a prerequisite if you want to talk to someone. If you want to sell someone, if you want to talk to the avatar, you need to do the exact same thing. That level of empathy, which empathy is inherent, but applied practiced empathy is something that I really wish that I had practiced earlier. And the number one advice that I could give to like any beginner copywriter here where it's like what should I do to really hone my skill set? Number one, read sales letters. Not copywriting books. Read sales letters. Hand copy all the stuff that everyone says to do. Hand copy them. Blah blah blah. Read the Gary Halbert letters specifically. The water ad specifically that one. If you've read it before, read it again. If you've read it twice, read it three times, etc., etc. and read his notes on why it worked. And then the next one is to read is to read fiction, more fiction, because you start to get a grasp for how to compile a narrative. And that is one of the most important things. Also, it just hones your skill in writing period, which I said this before, copywriting is writing. You'd be shocked at how many copywriters are dog [ __ ] writers. They don't know how to write, period, let alone copyright. So yeah, that's one thing that I wish I did earlier was read more fiction actively and knowing how to apply that then to copy. Interesting. Yeah, you just said something there where you said uh learning how to write and like the meta skill of learning how to write and then obviously you need that for that. I I made a video about this talking about how like stupid it sounds, but enhancing or like increasing your mouse speed, learning how to type faster, like these simple things are like these super meta skills that are like yes, it's crazy like the the lifts you can have. If you're on a computer 12 hours a day and you can go 30% faster than the guy next to you, like you have the same skill set, you're going to win. It's like it's stupid, but like yeah, the that's an interesting question and a very interesting answer. Fiction. Okay. I've never been good at that. And that's and that's what the whole obviously I mean but like that's story ideas that's like you said hero story that's the idea Okay. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. And I I would tell you the the exact kind of fiction that you want to read is one where you have a complex world where they do a lot of world building and you're still engaged because what that means that they had to get you to care about the character so deeply, the main character so deeply while keeping your attention between a bunch of different elements. And that skill set of retention obviously goes into everything else as well, right? And what the reading will do, why it's specifically reading and why it's not like, oh, can I just learn how to do this thing is because with reading, when you read, at least when I read, I can read six hours at a time. I have to physically stop myself from reading because it just happens in the background. Your your brain just really retains all of it, right? And is so much of it is subconscious. and read stories that again have that those complex worlds and that really keep you engaged. I would say if you can't be engaged within the first 20 chapters, scrap the book and try to find another one. If you're like being tactical about this, yeah, I would say that interesting. Okay, that's a good one. Very out there answer genuinely if I think about it. Yeah. No, no, I like it though. It's good. Um, how do you choose high converting? Okay, so basically what's your offer selection? So high converting offers, how do you pick which offer you're going to run? And let's just say this in in the context of picking a niche in picking an offer on a network something. It's like you're starting from scratch. Like how do you pick which one you think is going to have the most Yeah. Um, this is also something that I couldn't speak to as much as some others because I usually came in when they already had product market fit or they already had their I mean I did some like offer like offer presentation but they usually almost all the organizations already had some level of product market fit and distribution. Um, I will say how I started with how I picked repair like credit repair as the as the service and how I picked um funding. Now, I'll start with credit repair. Um, was the lack of sophistication around the organizations that were marketing it. And so that like that that's the easiest one is like if I can that's an interesting one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I can very easily tell that the biggest guys like the biggest guys in um repair which funnily enough they got sued and went bankrupt recently um forgi on Lexington law in credit repair.com they were doing around a billion a year and their advertising was horrible like horrible. so bad. And so I went like down the run. Like I kept looking at all these like repair companies. One guy I met, he ran a 20 million a year repair company and I just I went into his ads library and saw the ads and they were horrible. So everything was horrible. And so I was like, "Oh, I can just beat you." And so that's why I picked repair and I did and it was great. Um you you mentioned on your on one of the videos that you were selling a $500 product over the phone, right? I was selling a $200 product over the phone [Laughter] with a referral. That works. That works. I mean, it look it was uh Yeah. Know, it was interesting. I had to somehow incentivize commissionbased closers to be on the phones for I think it was like 30 to I I gave them like 30% plus um uh plus of all the residuals and all the recurring on a $200 product. Yeah. Well, that's back to your that's back to your question earlier is how do you make the math work for someone like that? So, where the the economics sense, but it's same thing. It's like when we were doing that, someone asked me about that or I was talking about the other day and I was thinking about it like I I need to pull receipts on this, but I want to say our cost per call was like, you know, 50 bucks, 80 bucks, somewhere in that range. So like the map worked and because it was essentially an offer to an audience that kind of already existed, it was almost like a retargeting situation in the beginning or like sending it more to warms. We had like more layups. The cost structure and where the market was made sense. Like it was almost like we were overdoing it for what we were trying to sell that could go direct to car probably. But like it it worked at the time and worked at the time. Yeah. But that's interesting. So your main thing is in markets that you can compete where you can layer in your skill stack that maybe there isn't a skill stack prevalent in that market. Okay. Yes. Because again I'm lazy and like I'm like I'm a little [ __ ] too. Like I don't I don't understand the like the backend stuff again like the operations itself. I know people who are so insanely sophisticated around creating alpha in other departments. My alpha is the marketing. And so, of course, that's what I lean towards, right? And so, that's what I'm going to be leaning towards when I pick an offer. Um, if you're if you're if you um if if you have an offer and you're let's say you're in ecom and you're selling I don't know supplements or whatever and you're trying to to choose an offer before running traffic. um if it's a already pre kind of like a pre-proven offer where it's I don't know um CMOS and you're using a either a buy one get one or um you're doing like a you're doing like the MR play right where you can kind of get a grasp on what your economics could be and then you you know you're like okay if I get you know 10% to ascend to XYZ then I can be profitable here like you're already halfway there just like just do the math like from back to just do the math on like what you need to hit everywhere and then literally just run a testing campaign and then just like see what you know see what's working if and like usually cuz like a lot of the times like creative now is like the the number one thing and it takes time to get to the winning creative. So a lot of the times your metrics won't be there like your your target CPA isn't going to be right there because you're just not as sophisticated on the ad side. But if it's wildly off where you're not where you know that you couldn't realistically get this number down then maybe that's not the right thing to go with. But like in terms of like Yeah. How do you think about the So what about things like that are commod this kind of question earlier but the commoditized stuff like talk insurance or like you said MVA at one point or those like how do you why why go into those markets then if those are kind of different than that right like those are all the top guys in the world say are trying to run final expense let's just say like yeah yeah so I can tell you from uh when I was in MBA which I have a very stringent NDA around this. So, I have to really think about what I can and can't talk about. I just won't I I won't I'll barely I I won't dock as much. Um right now MVA, they're struggling because CPAs are just like because everyone entered that market like everybody. And so I believe um the guy who does the the $50 million paper call business, he was saying the same thing with um with ACA, right? where like just everyone just flooded in there and they were running a bunch of like greyhound that was like different like the actual like offer owners were just like cutting off the partnerships with like because everyone was running grey hat right and the calls were [ __ ] um with MBA it's just like the CPAs are just through the roof right now and the reason why I went into that specific MVA company well they were obviously an an affiliate agency but they also had people on retainer um the reason why I joined that was because I saw that they were running one ad still live that was getting most of their spend that they made three years ago. And so again, there's that thing of, oh, I can just beat that, right? And I did, right? Like within literally like week one, I scripted, recorded, edited the ad myself. I I was literally in the ad. It was me like saying the script and everything. But it was cool because the spend like the spend per day that I got was insane. So it was still high lever high leverage. Um, and yeah, I beat it, right? And so that's why I was in in in in MBA and I just kept doing it. I just kept iterating on the actual creative that was being ran, right? Um they were very those industries, they don't understand what it truly takes to win on paid traffic, especially not meta. If you're running final expense 90 or Yeah. Fi yeah final expense, although I don't know that industry as much. I will say directly like MVA and like credit repair too because like you have paper call networks for or offers for credit repair too like these like big like these industries that are just like there like their ads are like looking for your thing call this number or click here like the most basic thing in the world and so I wouldn't if I was you if I was them the person asking this question and I want to choose an offer that's that I want to run I would literally choose an offer where the vertical is unsophicic icated in terms of creative testing, copy, scripting, all of that. And I would try to beat them on that level is like first and that's like pretty much and then I would just do that until that doesn't work anymore. And then I would choose the next offer, right? Like where's another what's another vertical where they're just not they just haven't gotten there yet, right? Which I'm sure there's a million other ways to choose a better offer, but that's like how I've done it and it's worked pretty well so far and that's how I would that's how I'm continuing to do it now. Um, another thing, another thing I'll mention now the the funding. So, monetization on the funding obviously backend like right, but we ran into a problem where we're like, my god, like the amount of people who are actually qualified for because we do primarily lines of credit. We're not dipping into MCA because I think it's genuinely a horrible product and I I'm not I'm not I wouldn't feel good selling it. Um, but we get our commissions on lines of credit and like 0% interest credit card stacking and we have this problem of like people just aren't qualifying. So I was like, "Oh, what if we created a funding optimization offer on the front end so we can liquidate people who aren't qualified now and then of course like our ascension rate can be there. We can pick up some dollars on that as well." So it supports both. No one's doing that. Everyone is just running and guess what the funny optimization is just credit repair. Like we've already done this before because we had customers where they where we repaired their credit and they got they got approved for XYZ whatever, right? And so now we're just transitioning that over to funding, framing it as funding optimization. Now I can all of a sudden charge three to four times more obviously because the outcome that's anchored but also the way that I'm positioning it, right? Yeah. And now I can liquidate front end like our front end is was very profitable. Um and then also I can get our ascension rate, right? Like so from introducing a brand new market, right? Ascend to application to funding and I still get the qualified people at the same time, right? So I'm just double dipping, right? And so I would do that too if I'm like seeing Yeah. Like if I'm saying something like this is like the the like hidden economics is as Allen calls it like I I like actually wrote down some examples like a lot of guys in the um a lot of guys who are running very similar to what you said where you're running the Instagram shoutouts and getting the email and then look at it like so many people still do like solo ads right like where they'll compile a list maybe they'll they have sold but then for a bucket that didn't ascend to their mid ticket which was the goal they'll just rent that list out to another person right and be like run your ads here and then I'll get an affiliate commission, right? That is a massive that is a massive portion of their actual like contribution margin dollars right there, right? Is that thing right there where if they didn't have that, it wouldn't be profitable, right? So like there's a lot of these like hidden economics espec also in credit repair too. Like the amount of people that just sell like payday loans to people like hey we're you're our customer and now you're qualified. Like it's horrible. I don't like it. It's unethical. But like those things make up a massive component of why that business is profitable. And that's tough because you don't know that until you're in that in that in that industry in that vertical actually running that business. You just don't know, right? But on the front end, that's what I do. Can I beat other people? Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. I mean, very similar to how your other response was for the other section of commoditized or not, like you're just beating them in the game and plain and simple. Like you're just able to win against the control, which is Yeah. And then yeah, we we were at uh Stephan Georg's copy whatever thing. We went I believe. Um we went to an inerson event and like so cool and the guys they had there like I love like all his stuff that he does but that's where we met Eddie for the first time actually uh that's when Luke and I met Eddie and then also um we met a guy there that was the data guy and he was talking he's like bro you guys could be making 200 grand a month more on your list just like farm it out and do all this stuff and we're like that's just not our game right we bought the we want to those leads and it's like our stuff is bigger brand but for a lot of people I bet that is a hidden economic that works great for somebody who's just pumping an offer. It's like why wouldn't you be doing that? I mean, I don't know. I don't even know compliance wise because we don't we don't do it. And like but I don't know where that sits, but yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, it can get very tricky. And I know I know some guys from um nothing held back who got like in trouble. They talk about it like they've got in trouble for Yeah. Yeah. They've gotten in trouble. So, I would not recommend it. It's not my game. I I I know a couple guys that are like big wigs that have gotten hit and like it's just not my game. Like and there's accidents where it's still you're still at fault, right? Like pure accidents and like that's the unknown stuff that scares but anything that's even close to that line like we're like nope like no good no good nope nope nope and the fear is around the stuff that's unknown or like something. So we have every once in a while we have like you know full audits basically and like look at everything and like oh change this language based on this now it's like okay we update that or make sure you do this or you know there's every once in a while there's one of these and like we do that as much as we can and try to get ahead of it. So yeah it's interesting. Yeah. Um, next one on here, Reddit forums to drive affiliate traffic. Wait, have you used Reddit or other forums to drive affiliate traffic? Affiliate traffic. What works best? No, I I'm I've been paid ads and I've been paid ads pretty much my entire career here. Um, besides when we were doing um besides when I was doing product stuff, I was in charge of um activation rate and ascension rate um in the the SAS product because we were doing like a PLG thing. I've never done traffic that hasn't been either paid or organic. And even organic is is not that. But no, not traffic. Now, of course, back in my uh I'm a changed man now, but yes, I used to do the uh like the Reddit spoofing thing where you would basically hijack um like a thread like you would bought it with comments of like your brand. So, people would search your brand and then the Reddit thread comes up obviously it's a bunch of people saying like pretty good things. It sounds natural. All fake of course. Like I've done that. I think everyone has at some point, but besides that, to run traffic, no, I never have. Could not say. Yeah, we've never done it. Um Jeremy Haynes talks about this a lot. He's like they came up on somebody who had basically like a 20 or 30% show rate and it was because of a bunch of like Reddit threads. Um I watch that video. Yeah, it's it sucks when there's like the deceptive ways of doing like not deceptive negative ways that are like attack version. It's just like frustating. It's frustrating. No, but there's also ones where like someone has a bad product and they go across and they have bad reviews and it's like I got to get this taken down. It's like dude if you have a bad product or you don't or this like that's its own game. But sorry, go ahead. Uh I was going to say I know a guy based in Russia who he does a lot of very interesting things. Um he's kind of like a mercenary for hire. So you come to him, you're like like hey I have a competitor. Uh can you make that competitor not a competitor anymore? and he'll do some things and he's done that before where he'll just he'll literally like steal branded traffic to just like fake bad reviews like as simple as that and it works. Yeah. You know, not a game that I would ever be in but you know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you just got to knock knock on everything and just like you know be good intent as you can and just like that's our game plan of it because like Yeah. I mean you think about it like the bigger companies that's kind of like my justification is like by no means are we some massive thing even in general but like I know guys that are five times 10 times the size of us that deal with you know a little of that but not really you know the public companies that have everything public and it's like they deal with that and it's like just shitty you know sometimes but it's part of the game I guess. Yeah. Yeah it is part of the game. Yeah. Um what do we have next on here? This one. No we already had that. That's a similar one. How do you handle objections and educate prospects between booking an actual call without giving away so much that they feel like they don't need to show up, which is that's an interesting way. Ah, okay. Um, I'm going to call out my homie Ben here for a second because he runs a uh cap Oh my god, Ben, I'm so sorry, dude. I forgot your last name, my man. Ben, everyone's going to be looking for you on No, no, no. Let me actually let me actually find him real quick on Twitter. Let me shout him out because uh he he actually gave me the sauce on this and I'm very diligent with actually like telling people that this was not me. This was him. One second here. Pretty sure it was Kaplan though. Ben Kaplan. Ben Kaplan on Twitter. Ben Kaplan. Anyone who's still here, you got to comment at two. Yes, Ben Kaplan. Hey, I got it. I got it. Okay. So, he runs a um he runs a a call center. I'm not going to dox everything that he does, but he told me about like how in B2B it's like the more information you give the better. Actually, there's no such thing as so much information that they don't show up in B2B specifically. And what he told me is like he has like a flow that he does. I'm not going to share what he does because it's like really really good. Um like you need to know like what actually to say, like what objections, what questions to to actually ask them. I'll give away what he actually asks, but he does it in such a way where people will show up on the sales call and be like, "Yo, dude, like thank you so much for asking me all these questions. Like, thank you so much for like giving me all this information." Like the preall stuff like it was fantastic. They show up because of that, not because you get like there's no such thing as giving away too much. Now, for consumer, um, if you want to handle objections and educate prospects between booking an actual call, do yourself a favor. Um, I will actually share this on Twitter after this episode as well. There is a postbooking u VSSL framework by the goat himself, Alan Sanic, that everyone needs to take and copy and make their own. He made it free available for everyone because he's a G. Um I will post that or like DM me and like I'll send it to you. Um use that first of all because he's like he's insane. He does all that. Um, a lot of the times when it comes to objections, especially with consumer, I found that it's not actual objections around the thing, it's very similar to a call. Um, and Jeremy, like Miner talks about this a lot where it's not the actual objection itself. It's something like they're they're hiding it, right? And so a problem they're hiding like why they actually like it's just well actually man, it's because of XYZ. Actually, dude, it's because of this, right? So like if you know how to pre-handle those on a sales call, it's good. And so what you can do if if you run a sales run a sales work, the best thing that you can do is when you have if you know how to handle those objections and get to the actual core reason why those objections came up and what are the actual ones, just take those from your sales data, right? And actually answer those because a lot of the times what you think in is an objection in the market isn't actually an objection. And if you try to answer the wrong thing, it'll have the adverse effect of what you want to do. And another thing that I've noticed, yeah, a lot of another thing that I've noticed a lot is like I was I ran this um I ran ads and did copy for this like ecom bisop thing. Um and they were like very faceless. They they had like a guru, but it was one of those it was one of those like medical you know those medical had like the supplement ads where it's like the fake doctor, right? Like it was that before the ecom stuff which is kind of smart. Um, and so in the post booking it was it was a problem like we had maybe like 43% show up rate and this was three years ago. So that's really bad three years ago. Like horrible three years ago, right? Yeah. Really bad. And I was like, damn, like what's happening? We realize two things. First is the concept of negative self- admittance. And so we noticed something that was happening in the VSSL and in the post call flow. people to go through that had to through the copy and messaging that was there before had to admit to themselves that they were poor and stupid to even do this thing to even hop on the call. And this is something Allan talks about a lot is I mean do you have a piece of and I know for you on the weight loss thing like same exact thing like if you have to if a prospect has to admit them to themselves that they're fat and ugly. Guess what? They're not going to show up on a call dude and talk about how ugly and fat they are. They're not going to show up on a call and talk about how poor and stupid they are. They're not going to do that. And so it's the most simple frame shift in the world. Instead of getting negative self- admittance, you do just third party. You talk in third person. So it's like if you have some things that like because sometimes you have to get them to like the negative state, right? If you just talk and say like people who aren't successful, sometimes they do XYZ. People who aren't not if you do XYZ that's why you're unsuccessful. Unsuccessful people who do this behavior, this is why they're unsuccessful, right? And like literally just that frame switch so many times can change the entire paradigm and the entire frame of how you're communicating and immediately it's better. Um, another thing, so that's the first thing is the negative self- admittance. We fixed that led to a really good I think we went from I don't remember the exact number but it was like a pretty good lift just from that. But the second one was very interesting. It wasn't an an objection thing. It was a mindset thing. So they of course we did all the stuff on the VSSL. Here's it's possible. It's probable. You're going to do it. Guess what? There's people forget what they just watched because a lot of the time like they forget, dude. They forget all the time. And so this is like kind of where Jeremy's like or um Yeah. where Jeremy's like hammer them thing comes in obviously. But yeah, exactly. Literally just Yeah. Literally just repeating the points that you made in the VSSL of why this is possible and then probable for you specifically prospect is going to be way better than handling objections, right? because you get them to a mindset state, you kind of have to like keep that really high vibration emotions going on within them where they're like super hyped up that you did through your VSSL. You kind of have to find a way to keep that up. And of course, like as you know on the upside, there's like the postbooking flows and then obviously you can do the hammer them like with the pipelines like all that, etc. But do that instead of just being like how much does this thing cost, right? Like what does the program look like, right? Like here are some student wins, right? Like instead of doing that, like think more about the mindset frameship that you have to instill in someone specifically for B TOC. Specifically for B TOC, especially for B to C. Um B2B way easier. Like literally just give them all the information that they need. Give them everything. Literally just give them everything and then and then you'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I could not agree with you more on the entire on everything you just said. I mean it's all the framing completely. We had a post video that was around cost and it like nuked them. They're also using it in hammer them strategy and it was nuking it and because we were bringing up our theory is because we were bringing up that un thought concern style thing, right? Or like un they just were unaware of that and how we framed it and solved it was like not correct. Uh versus we have another one now that like popped off on organic that we used and then we leveraged there. But that plus we have multiple like you said basically following that script and then the multiple questions pre-objection and then testimonials that are in the frame like you said using third party verifiable result like we did all of those um plus some more tactical [ __ ] for sure but the B2B one you say is so funny to me. I talked about it on here but I booked a call with somebody that I wanted to talk to and it was kind of like I wasn't that interested but someone recommended it and I was like okay I'll just do it. I go on their website, could find some stuff, some testimonials, but they were broad and they were kind of like longer and I was like whatever. Like that's not my exact use case, so I'm not going to watch them. And I literally responded that the schedule page didn't work. This I'm sorry, the scheduled success page didn't work. So there was no like I didn't get redirected from Calendarly and then they sent me an email that says sometimes it doesn't work. Here's the link. I click on the link, it doesn't work then either. I email back and I go send me everything humanly possible you can before this call. And it's B2B, right? And they don't send me anything. and our calls in like 10 minutes and I get an email and it's like here's a testimonial, whatever. I click on it. It's like, hey, I see you asked for resources. I click on it and they had just uploaded to YouTube two minutes prior and I'm like, bro. And like it was helpful like testimonial, but I got on with them and the real thing here is I got on with them and they had such a good offering and such a a fit for what I was looking for that I did end up doing business with them. And it was just funny because I was like, "Guys, you need some love on this process." That was bad. Like bad news. So, That's funny. That's a good sign for them. Yeah, that's a good sign for them. If their offer was so good that they didn't even need those things to convert you, that's kind of a good sign. It's like, dude, the potential is like go to the for sure. But you and I both know you could have the best product in the world and if nobody knows about it or gets to it properly, like, you know, and that's not their goal after talking to them. It's like they don't need this dialed in process because the people who need to make it to them generally come through referral or through this or like organic basically. So, it doesn't matter. They don't need all the DR hacks and texts at this perfect time based on time zone and someone to dial like you don't need that because they don't do the volume. But yeah, it's a that was a really good answer that you had. Yeah. Yeah. Um let next one let bad KPI top spenders spend for top ofunnel or cut them. I think that's just what uh Oh yeah. Yeah. So if you're if you're running ad if you're running an ad um and Facebook is spending on the ad and you have bad KPIs for top of funnel specifically all this should this is relevant for all ah got it got uh or cut them uh yes cut them next question not sure if you do much payer call but I'm so interested on how you generate quality inbounds quality I was gonna say I feel like you kind of touched your way around this already but what would your succinct answer for this be? Yes. So um in the with the repair offer I was buying calls um there were transfer calls so they weren't like direct there were transfer calls from call center to then uh just outbound list like hey are you blah blah blah and then they get transferred over to us. Um so I've dealt with um paper callers like we were going to onboard one who was doing like just pure um just pure like ads to us. I'll be honest, like I'm so unsophisticated when it comes to like the like publishers and like networks and like all that stuff is like I was it was just so like direct partnership like so bare bones. Um and I just eventually I kind of like gave up and I was like dude I can [ __ ] generate these calls myself like why am I not like what am I doing here? And so just started generating calls myself and so I really liked the idea of like click to call because I had done before that I would do intake forum of course is like a quizunnel. I split tested between quizfunnel, see if you see if you qualify, like you know, all those different like intake forms. Um, and then I would have my sales reps like outbound dial them the second like like two minutes after they opted in. And so I'd have them dial them and then start a conversation. That's how I was doing it. Um, and so I learned about paper call and I was just like, "Oh, let me just switch it to short intake form and then button to call someone, right?" So, okay. And so I was doing basically paper call but for myself. So if Yeah. Yeah. So that's what the question. Yeah. Yeah. That's the question. How do you generate inbound quality inbounds? Okay. So, uh number one, don't do any of the insane like grey hat stuff that like the the ACA guys like there's a few other industries where they were just doing like ridiculous like don't do any of that. That if you have to do that that just means that you have a skill issue and you don't know how to sell your own thing. And so you have to tell people that they're getting an EBT card for 500 bucks, right? Because like you can't sell your own thing. So first of all, if you feel the pull to do any kind of gray hat or black hat stuff, stop and realize that you don't have the skill set. So get the skill set. Fix that first because that is not how you are going to build a sustainable business pipeline, anything like that. No one will trust you or respect you. Okay? If you do that, no one who actually matters will respect like black hat stuff. Um so that's first of all. Now, how you generate quality inbounds is very funny because it's like kind of like everything that we've been talking to talking about to this point, which is just how to sell and market period. And so, it very much so depends on the niche. So, um I can talk about repair because that's what I was doing. So, uh and and uh MVA as well, but that was also the intake and then calling them, right? So, first was the uh it was very simple structure. It was just like outcome, right? was like what was the outcome that they wanted and then it was what's the perceived trust level around this thing which was massive for repair because no one no one trust repair like everyone's heard of credit repair everyone thinks that it doesn't work we had a product that actually worked like it was insane it actually worked I was like okay but I can't say trust me this thing works right like same thing in MVA which is also like a big industry for paper call now is like everyone's ran through the angle of like these people are getting rich doing this thing, right? Like everyone's kind of ran through that angle, right? And so if you do that, you're just going to be put into the same trust bucket, right? And so it's kind of difficult because like that is the outcome, right? That is what you're saying, but you have you do have to like kind of switch. And so what I did for repair was I was like, okay, look, people want the outcome. They don't trust anyone, which when when they don't trust a company, they don't trust the process that the company is saying that they'll use. It's as simple as it is. And so I was like, hm, okay, what if instead now I just went so deep on process that they couldn't have a choice but to trust me, right? And so that's what I did. I'm not going to because we do have to run through these. So I'm not going to go like super heavy. Was the same thing I was talking about before problem mechanism using su mechanism like blah blah blah. And then deeper core reason why. No, this is my it's my favorite topic. It's my favorite topic like of all time is that like I'm I'm truly a copywriter in my in my heart. Like I'm just I just I love it. But anyway, um to get the call itself, which is the one thing that's like, wait, why do I need to call like you think it'd be obvious, but again, like some of these some of these markets aren't the most sophisticated in terms of like uh IQ. So like sometimes they don't know why they need to call. You need to actually give them a reason why. And this was the problem with all the grey hats was like call now to get your to get your EBT food stamps, right? Call now to get this XYZ. What I did is going to sound stupid simple, but I kind of took the whole thing for the I was learning from like the B2B funnels, which I ran in like the most the most s like marketing for coaches, right? Like funnel building for co I had to like write copy for those kinds of offers, right? Like super sophisticated, right? So I just took a very simple principle which is what do these people want right now like today which is the concept with the AC funnel right it's like you like the offer that you build when you run an AC funnel is give them something plugandplay right that they can get right now and so when I was running the marketing funnel it was that but it was like ads right I was like get three uh high converting three ads like that are high converting based off of $3 million worth of spend but it's going to be tailored to you so we need to get on a call to understand your offer, right? Basic structure there. So, we weren't these weren't pre-filled. These were custom made for you. And so, I did that and just transferred it over to repair, which was very simple. What do people want? This is where the research comes in because I found out that people that the credit repair market, the people who are credit uh challenged, they don't even know why they're credit challenged. Look on Reddit. They'll be like, "Oh, I have wait I paid this bill off." And I was like, what? Like, why why did my score go down and then up and then B? They don't know. So, oh, this that's simple. Free credit consultation. And then, of course, you have your sexy bullet copy, like really sell the call, like heavy sell the call. And like um uh this guy Matsk on um on Twitter on his email list. He's a he's an info guy. He does like a lot of webinars. And for he's like for selling the webinar like just curiosity over everything like gatekeep like gatekeep heavy but also sell it. And so that's what I was doing for the calls. I did the little timer as like your slot expires in 100 like in a minute and 57 seconds because we're getting a bunch of like all those little tactics. But I had to figure out the call offer itself based off of what people were questioning and what questions people had in that market. Like what do they really want to know right now? And this was so important to them that like it it crushed like it crushed. It genuinely crushed. And I was getting I think Yeah, I like that. Yeah, it was it was not sustained, but for a week I had $10 calls. Yeah, it wasn't sustained, but for a week I had No, no, no, no. But for a week and we're and we were spending it was like at scale in terms of like it was like decent spend, but for a week we had like $10 calls and it was fantastic. But like it it crushed. And so that's how I would generate like quality inbounds. It's like stop doing all this like weird like external stuff. Like make it about your offer and figure out what questions that they have and what do they want right now. Right. For example, local um I told my uh my buddy of mine runs a um a lawn care business down here in South Florida and he was running a funnel. It was like everyone's just like the get your free quote, right? And he did the dumbest thing. So simple. It was just see exactly how much your dream lawn costs. You think it's the same thing. It's not literally just that switch. 30% lower uh cost per call. Just that switch. And so it's cra like I said like that's why I love copy because I I think it's like the number one lever. I truly do. People say offer. I kind of agree. I agree. Offer is number one. we can kind of all agree to that. After that, it is literally copy because it's just that frame switch, right? And so, yeah, just figure out what people want. If you're running, you know, if you're running um if you're running calls in like whatever market you're in, this is this is depending like it you can do this in any any market, any vertical that you're in. Just figure out what people actually want and then deliver that and then deliver how you're going to give them that, right? Which I won't get too specific. I like that. I like the how as I mean yeah you've layered that in a couple times and I I just keep thinking of examples how we can use that in other offers of guys I know that I'm like oh that's pretty obvious like but it's not you think so you'd think so it's been obvious for 60 years because the most famous marketer of all time David Ogiel he literally says reason why marketing that's his whole thing like we're still forgetting that because I think at this point we've gotten so I think it's been so diluted down we're all following the same formulas by the same guru that were popularized 20 years ago and we're still using them because we're terrified of messing up, right? Because our client's going to fire us, right? Like we think that this thing has worked okay for now and so I'm just not going to change it, right? And so it's like a game of telephone. Like it's like the actual like the actual principles just get diluted like you know. But yeah, that's my answer. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, that's a solid one. Um, next one on here, I don't know if this is relevant for you, but Tik Tok organic funnel the Telegram offer. Oh yeah. Like do you do like you see all these guys that do Tik Tok organic pretty heavily. I mean let's just talk that part in general. Yeah. Yeah. So I know the um he mentioned he literally mentioned Young Indian Method. I know the guy who started that which is the most hilarious name of any program I've ever heard. Young Indian Method. But I I know him and so um we talked because he needed some help on like the paid side and so he just ran me through the organic side on Tik Tok. Um he kind of to really win on Tik Tok like to really win like there are some organic offers info offers that just pop the hell off and like there were like the really like the control in that industry for the format itself. You do have to innovate on the format itself. So like he innovated on like a it was like a meme slideshow format where it was like POV uh yeah it was like a text sorry it was a text thread my bad it was a text thread between his Indian employee which was just I'm sure just him and his friend like actually making these formals his Indian employee and it was like hi sir can you please give me raise to 50 cents an hour and then the 50 cents yeah 50 cents an hour and the response was like um no you're not worth that much keep working Jeet or something crazy like that. And it was like obviously it was like very like cuz you were kids who was buying this program, right? But like he just rinsed that format forever until it stopped working and then the whole offer stopped working because yeah like that's what that's what was getting and he couldn't innovate for he like more he just got really lucky on that like actual format of the thing that really worked. I would say you can do that. A lot of it is luck. I mean, if you're like really entrenched in organic, which I'm not, you kind of know the the formats that perform organically. I was actually gonna ask you this question because you were talking about how you wanted to go hard with organic. Uh, what do you think about clipping? Yeah, I mean I there's different ways to play that game, right? Where it's like one is the content in general and it's like are you dedicated creating it? Is that a whole another job for said content creation or AIing or whatever? or do you have stuff that's long that you can turn into shorts that actually do it and different people have different opinions. I've seen and again this is not our game so this is like my theory around this or what I've heard. Um you know the ones that create them dedicated supposedly do better a lot of the time than the you know Gary Vee example taking something long and cutting it short. I don't think that's necessarily always true but maybe a higher hit rate. Um but the big thing for us is the distribution side of it. So you have like the creation and then you have the distribution. So distribution you have people like Iman who control the assets and like yes it does spread beyond that but you control the narrative where you are controlling the actual distribution accounts which requires a team or whatever agency or someone to do that whole portion of it not just farm it out on [ __ ] content rewards. I think the difference there is like the control you have is huge and how the narrative goes or swings one way because they lean into whatever pocket starts to get it and like if it if that's not back to our thing about like congruency or you know you have a lander that says you win a free cruise versus you have a lander that says it's the hardest thing ever like one's going to get way higher optin or views or whatever. Um, and if it maybe hits different or a clip is different in a way that maybe doesn't serve what the true goal is, which is to get converting high ticket customers, let's say in our example. Um, that can be an issue. So, it's like who's the audience it lands on and what is the message that maybe hits the virality or the or spreads that maybe is either clipped out of context or is right. So, you just kind of play that game. Um, I'm a fan. I think the model itself makes a ton of sense. You've seen the guys who crushed it for the fame side more or less or like the the increased following and then converted that because they were the right audience or they built an offer that fit that audience is maybe even a way to say it. Yeah. But for us because our offer structure is relatively fixed uh and the demo is relatively fixed in that way like that's the only concern is the control of who the audience becomes and then how we choose to do distribution. I don't worry about the creation because we have the bandwidth to do that and we have so much that we can repurpose that was either directly built for it or can truly be repurposed. Um, but yeah, that's kind of like I'm down for it. It's just like when and then also having something that's likely more mass market for offer that can convert uh versus that's the other that's like the affiliate issue. That's the virality issue is when your mechan like or your your process is includes like calls for example you have 48 hours of booking availability for 200 spots and the second you hit some viral moment and that's the only way through not a direct to cart not a some xyz uh you're burning that fame or viral like viral moment and you're breaking the business because of the spike and like that's been an issue with us talking about with affiliates. So someone's going to mail their 2 million person list. It's like we'll get filled in whatever. Let's just say it's just for ease. Let's say it's 100 bookings. Like as soon as you hit that, the next 400 that try are like buried in this mess and then you're trying to get setters and like is the quality there from this one source or is it like piece and parted and like you don't know those variables. So we that's the reason we've kind of stayed away from it thus far. Um not to say that we won't over time or once we have direct to cart. I think direct to cart that like crushes that then has that kind of audience like mass appeal whether it's affiliate or clip or whatever like I think that'll make more sense for us. Um but still same fear there is if you bring someone into low ticket just because they can buy low ticket but the low ticket person is not somebody who ascends into high ticket it breaks the whole model anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Interesting. Okay. So you want to have control over the actual content that's being first of all that's being actually distributed. So like you can't do the Tate like affiliate model, right? Where it's like you just give them whatever here's a million clips like you clip it up, you do XY and then if you were the Yeah, maybe you could if you were the one clipping it directly and maybe you even could with the long form where someone finds it. Like people have asked to do it for me. Let's use me as an example. like they've been like, "Oh, can we do this?" or "Oh, you should use this," whatever. And it's like my goal is, and I say in all these videos, is like to build an audience, network, whatever, in this pretty like hyper niche zone that are mid6 figure, seven figure a month guys that or guys and gals, right, that are that I can find talent through and with as well as the audience of people and then that I can get opportunities for deals or whatever comes upon into the future. And then really, it's just the network. It's like meet people like you and be able to have these conversations to be able to be in DM and it's like, "Oh, I just found this cool thing." Or me shooting something over to you and like I just never had that. Um, so when someone says, "Hey, I want to clip your stuff and get you to like, you know, 100K in the next month." It's like I don't know that there's 100,000 people. I don't know the number or the TAM or what it really is, but like you know, my game is not like, oh, let's just increase the numbers necessarily as much as it is like let's find the right pockets of people. And I don't know, I don't know how sat saturated I am on that right now. like the numbers go up, but like at what point am I at saturation where it's like the top kind of people or whatever people I want to really hang out with. There's the education play that's like just helping people who are maybe, you know, at other zones and just doing it for free. I like it's nice and it's fun to talk through, but does the audience exist? Uh beyond that inside where those audiences and shorts and stuff live with someone who maybe has shorter attention span, I sit here and talk for 20 minutes straight about Yeah. the call reminder sequence like you know what I Like that's only going to hit for somebody like seriously like it's only going to hit for somebody that it hits with. And that's kind of the point. I could do 10 times better and all these people [ __ ] [ __ ] on me because they're like, "Oh, you don't do this and you're like marketer." And one, I'm not a marketer. And two, uh I know I know what the game is. I kind of know what the game is supposed to be and I do this much of it. And it's like clipping is one of those things on the list. Gotcha. I can um I I'll connect you like after this. Um, I can connect you to a guy who um, we are going to because I have like an ecom project on the side who we're going to be using as like a clipping agency. Um, I think he came in through like Eddie Cumberbatch's like clipping agency bisop which is really embarrassing for him but he actually does really good work and he will it's kind of embarrassing bro but he um, he does both like where he'll you can control the content but you also get the benefit of the distribution. So it's like kind of splitting the diff. So I can like shoot him over um, shoot you over his Twitter like afterwards. I know the [ __ ] guys. as well. And they've talked about how like you see the people who blast them on X about it and oh, it got this or they're allowing X content, but like they also have like a really innovative thing kind of built where they have the, you know, it it's cool. It is cool. And I think you can limit certain audiences and there are going to be mess ups and like it's tech and it's whatever and people are going to play play the system. But like I think what those guys side tangent what those guys are building is very cool. It's clearly like, you know, Young Money Twitter vibe and stuff and but like I think as they continue to grow and maybe expand beyond that, like they're going to be a beast and they're just playing the game right now. But it's Yeah, absolutely. And they got the and they got the VC capital to back. So they're going to do Yeah, they got the VC capital and they got the names. They got they got the names now with, you know, Iman to own info coaching game with them. Yeah. So yeah. Cool. Um these next two hooks angles already did that. sauce on biz loan offers. Already kind of did that. Next one. Franchise franchise bisop offer. What does that mean? Uh yes. So I made a post on it was the smartest info. Um actually here let me just bring this up. Sorry once more. There's about an info offer here. Anyone who's still here 2.5. We keep doing this at the perfect breaks. Okay. Yeah. The smartest info offer uh owner I know to switch his entire business to a franchising model. So he's kind of swiped the economics from EXP realy. Um full incentive alignment between him and his customer franchise franchisee 10x higher ACV just longer across longer time horizon lesson in there. So he's doing something where it's like an MLM but it's not actually. So, if I take it, because I'm not about to dox them because it's genuinely a really crazy model, but let's say you run an agency like how to start your own agency thing, right? Instead of selling a course on how to start your own agency, you license out your agency model. You he charges people for the program and the knowledge and the implementation, but he has like you don't have to worry about fulfillment. You don't have to worry about taking sales calls. We'll do all that. You generate pipeline, you generate calls, book meetings. Here's how you can do that. And then the course goes there, right? And then it's we'll compensate you. So he he gets paid first on the front end for charging people on how to do that, but then he takes I think it's 5 to 10%. Right? So he'll he'll give 95% of whatever to that person, right? And he'll keep like 10% or or whatever like what I think that was his thing. He has some compensation structure of like how he compensates them versus like what he keeps and it has to be like congruent. We'll see how this holds up at scale if he gets to scale it. Um, but this guy, this is a guy who this is one of those like top ClickBank offer guys, right? Like this is this is one of those dudes. He's like actually one of the smartest info offer rooms I know. This could be he's schizophrenic or like he has dementia right now or it could be the greatest idea of all time. We'll see. But yeah, this is I didn't realize that's what this question meant. And I could talk on this for the next two hours and we have 27 minutes left because I have a hard stop. But the dude this is so much top of mind for me right now that I probably use the wrong words but these are the ones I keep using about how the fulfillment model and the monetization model can be so different across the vast like across so for his example right let's say so he's doing call it group coaching or it's basically it's a course plus you know probably whatever either oneto ones or group coaching calls is the classic thing most people are going to use the monetization model of either lifetime access for five grand or whatever they're going to use maybe something where there's continued coaching so there's either a backend something or they're going to have it right off the rip as it's 5 grand to start and then 2k a month like these different options right that's like 99.99% of people's monetization model I have been vastly searching this and hearing some crazy [ __ ] on how people do this all the way to like think of the nth degree that you can take it and this is exactly what I was talking to you about about how you structure not the fulfillment of you doing everything, but the monetization play of how you do everything because instead the deal structure can go as far as like if it's a business that has some term some sort of exit value can be equity. It can be the next back which is probably profit share. The one before that is probably rev share. Like you go down the tanches and those two can kind of flip depending on where the margins sit. But like all the way back to where like someone either doesn't even pay you because you're learning while earning to you're making five or 10 grand a month retainer to you're making performance pay rev or this to like you have equity. Now, yeah, the difference on that in the fulfillment model, this is like so top of mind, is how you service it in in tandem to how you're paid on it because you got to think of the highest leverage possible is very likely going to be one of these percents, whether it's equity, profit, uh, equity, profit share, or rev share. how you fulfill on it. Whether it's your time, whether it's a course, whether it's coaches or you coaching, whether it's group co, like the top top top tier example, I heard of this, the guy makes multiple eight figures uh a year, has equity positions in a ton of these companies and does fulfillment through group coaching calls. So, you have you're an in you basically Yes. Yes. Think about this. So, you have twice a week, you have two hour blocks, let's say. So you have four hours of time that you're spending for your fulfillment is that okay the monetization instead of charging five grand a month or whatever to access this guy's time in a group coaching setting not one to one which is the highest leverage. Yeah. He then has equity as his monetization play. So these are all exitable businesses. They're like in the software e game. So he has equitable things where he literally gives his time through group instead of onetoone. And think about the leverage of that right? you have this much time and then you have the biggest backend possible because these are equitable business like companies that could sell you go the next step further or like backward I guess and it's like okay how do you do it in group or onetoone setting that's likely like revshare I talked to a guy in here that takes x percentage of rev share because they have such a good model and they deploy like one or two people right so that's like kind of the the the more time inensive or cost intensive one because you have to pay people or your time is all scattered you're working on all these things he get all the way to the degree to where he just has to work these four blocks. And of course, I'm sure there's a million other things and this is like I'm oversimplifying this I'm sure on his involvement, but like that for the highest return possible. Crazy. That's nuts. I've never in my life heard of equity for group coaching. Yeah, dude. People I mean, think about it. It's like who makes sense though. It makes sense though. Yeah. Yeah. the most extreme like would you give like I you know I don't know the details of the hormosi models but like you know you hear equity things you hear rev shares you hear all these things like that is they they you know I again I don't know enough of their model but like theirs could be something like that or it could be a leading team that they deploy in but like it could be as simple he has enough leverage where he could do that of course so crazy wow you can get so creative with this stuff you can get so creative with that and that's kind of where I'm trying to dance and we're late enough in this I can talk about this. But like that's what I'm kind of like cooking because I have so many cool opportunities that are coming and like we need to stay focused on the main thing is the main thing. So that's one main reason where I'm not like oh I want to go launch this thing but like there's just so much opportunity and cool businesses I see that I like want to help but like and I do just kind of help for free right now and I say on the channel like I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything and like I want to stay in that land of like I don't sell anything in terms of that but like there may be some version of a play that's monetization method of that style thing and like coaching instead not deployment not I'm in your stuff I'm in doing this and this and like clicking keys but like maybe in time when there's enough pent up or I find the right partner maybe that is like already kind of that person where I can just like we can co-do it. I don't know. That would be that that's that's something that's attractive to me because of the model and the upside. Do you think that do you think that's more of like an auxiliary thing to what you're doing now or do you think that's the next like step up auxiliary? Um well it just depend. Yeah. I mean like it would definitely start as auxiliary just cuz like I would want to feel it but I we talked about this a lot uh internally but it's like at what scale or size like because we have so many so much horsepower within sea level and then also us like there's there is overlap um where we love this we loved working we love the like the game sounds so stupid but like I just like building stuff and like skill leveling up so I see it as probably the same amount of work just in what vehicle. So it's like how much time do we allocate to this or and the other thing is like at at certain scale and size ideally we get to where it's like machine enough that it does a lot of these pieces and you don't need to be on it 10 hours a day every day seven days a week like and but if you want to work your 10 or 12 hours you want to be on a computer and you can do that better and probably do like you know I'm bad with time management but like let's just say it's that it can be half your time and there's definitely the play is this shiny object is this this and this and I don't really know um but the goal would be to get this thing up to where it's like machine, it's growing, you can own your portion because we have these other, you know, co-owners and leads and performance pay people that really own their own zone to where like you're almost in their way if you're doing things. So if we do that correctly then yeah the time requirement and then your head is in free space and is that cool because you're thinking of these way bigger things to take this one further or does this one have its kind of natural trajectory of XYZ and then there is time to kind of noodle around on this or just that's why I'm saying like almost with a partner because I think it'd be cleaner with that or someone um because yeah I just I just think that would be cleaner external to this. Um, I don't know though. We'll see how that all all shores out and like I'm not in any rush to do any of that necessarily, but there's definitely opportunity for it. Yeah, that's that's you just gave me some perspective there because I was I was going to I was like that's interesting, but I was kind of skeptical about like the original post that I was talking about of that guy like with the franchise thing. But like yeah, there's a guy who's doing Yeah, it's just the online version of it, right? I mean, like if he has a really good model, it's the same thing as like the licensing model like we talked about in the video. I keep mentioning him, but like I consume a lot of his content. I think I like how he thinks through things and like the framework, but he talked about how the reason Jim Launch sold was essentially it was licensing and because the recurring portion and the you know recurring revenue that was around them basically producing ads at their cost, testing ads on their cost and then finding winners and giving that to them as like just the very bare bones. They have all the other stuff, the info, the coaching, the education, all the stuff around it. But like that piece as like a deliverable that was recurring inside there was a big piece of like why people would stay, right? They were licensing those materials. So in this exact example, a franchise, which there's a big difference, and I'm not a franchise person, but there's like three things I think that make a franchise and like if you hit all three, you get like screwed and you have to be under franchise law versus licensing where if you one or two, I think is I think is how it works. I don't know. Not an expert. Um, but it's that model. It's like if you already built it, then you get either same thing monetization model. If you're a franchise, you're getting a percent. If you're not franchise and you're licensing, you get generally 2K a month that they pay in recurring to access the stuff. And it's like a differentiator there. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, I mean I it makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah, I wanna I want to explore that with you a I want to explore that with you like more now, but I know we still have some questions. But we'll we're definitely going to talk after this because I have some ideas. I'm sure there'll be round two of this. I'm sure there'll be around too. I don't know how to do these long ones though without this being like very difficult for someone to follow along with. Do you know the gist of this one? Yeah. Yeah. So, this one I have no idea. Um I wanted Okay. Something Yeah. Yeah. Also, it's black hat. Don't do black hat. Okay. That's my answer right there. Selling lead flow. Next one is is kind of too selling lead flow in tricky niches when companies aren't listing affiliate programs publicly and gaining access to deals that are publicly available. Uh also affiliate offers a second. I am not I'm not an affiliate. I I some people think that I'm an affiliate because I'm like direct response. I'm not an affiliate. Um not the not the guy to ask this question. Uh wish I knew the answer. So sorry. Wish I knew the answer. I do not. No idea. Not affiliate guy. Sorry, man. Yeah, I have I actually have some context for this one, which is interesting. Okay, who would have thought? Who would have thought? Um, and this is probably not what he's asking, but one of the examples of this is when I was running with those media buyer guys, uh, they crush twoman team. They are killers. They do massive spends and one is like kind of more business strategy taught the other one and then now the other one is like the full-time, you know, 20our a day media buyer, sicko, like just in it. Um, but they will do really cool stuff that they do a lot of paper call. They do everything like they'll find a pocket and like hit it, but they have their kind of like more evergreen stuff and they will do really cool things. It's not really affiliate offer necessarily stacking um but like lead genen stacking where they will take you know the basic stuff like oh they're going to run 247 but during these hours that are XYZ of call it is going to it's going to the call and then this other thing on the back end whatever. Then on off hours, it's the same type of flow where you're maybe getting a way less call because it's in the 247 center, which is, you know, lower um whatever RPCs. And then on the back, they have these form fills that like more than liquidate it. So they take that form fill as a true form fill when during the day they wouldn't take it as a form fill because they can route it. You're not they're not like, you know, they're doing exclusives, so they're not doing doubles, but the others you are allowed to do that. So, it's more it's more so like taking the same funnel and like squeezing it more for 247 coverage versus that. So, they get their like really high over here, but they they make profit still on these like off hours, but they do it in like a different way. I thought that was interesting. And then also some of the stuff with uh how they'll again I don't know if this is stacking as much as this is routing but they'll do stuff similar to that where they have really good direct deals and partnerships not like through networks um that they will route based on um or based off of uh that they can like dupe out. So they'll again have certain things that are exclusive that they won't that'll come through and then they'll have like super I mean these guys are like white hat like really good at what they do. Um and so they follow all the rules. Um, but they will they'll do stuff like that where if they have exclusive versus not exclusive, they can take the form data and do that or they can route through. And I'm like, "Oh, that's pretty interesting because they they monetize it in multiple ways. Someone who fits this bucket also fits this bucket and they have the compliance checks and stuff to make sure that they're allowed to do that which I thought was interesting." And so are those guys selling they're selling two different offers to kind of like the same like list like the same input traffic but two different offers. Yeah. Okay. And I'm like complimentary offers. Okay. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It's like I mean imagine you're running you know let's use simple examples but like ACA and debt right like you have filling out certain things around like how much credit or whatever where you sit on this you can also route them for the other as long as you have like the correct relationship or the correct thing um but it just brings that overall blended number blended blended blender up which then is the true number you're looking at right you spent 100 grand you make 110 but now you make 115 it's like that's a lift that's a real lift that you can have margin for error in other zones So yeah. Yeah, that one that's actually affiliates with affiliate version of this. I've seen people go ham with again I don't really know what they mean by stacking as much as like multi- hit like I've people crush crush doing capture on affiliate and then using that email list and then splitting the list like take it like to the nth degree. It's like they're hammering them with multi offer. They're then hitting them with upsell on it because they have backend to the affiliate as well. So then they are part of the uh the rev on the back and then they also will do things where they split the list and then have completely dedicated personas. It's kind like like the decision tree just goes likeoop and then it just keeps going and keeps going and keeps going. Add infinite items. It's crazy. Yeah. Know there's some guys who are absolutely cracked. And actually to to answer I didn't think about this before which is funny but brain is kind of getting fried right now. I need my adal. I don't know where my dealer is bro. Um, for that I was I was literally buying with the credit repair thing. I was literally buying debt settlement leads. I gave them a script of like, hey, here's what you can say because it was like an inactive list, right, of people who like didn't pick up during whatever window. Like there wasn't enough concurrencies or whatever during that time. So I could like take those I could take that list have them activated with a script that I wrote myself of like, hey, like if your credit's blah blah blah and you have XYZ debt, we can actually get that removed, etc. And then Yeah. So yeah, if you were the affiliate who ran that traffic, then you could sell it to someone like me or you could pitch it to someone like me. Um because I had that idea, but I'm sure a lot of companies don't have those ideas or at least haven't materialize them and you can just sell that if you're an affiliate, especially in paper call if you're like Yeah, that a quote that I like from Hormosi where he talks about like how else like what you talked about the un untapped monetization or or what you call it hidden monetization method. Hidden hidden economics. That's from Allen. That's how he describes it. I like that. Yeah. No, dude. We're all just We're all just distilling somebody um at this point in life, I think. But um the he talks about how having partnerships on the back, like simple example, but you sell it over to the chiropractor that's next door because you do some back something where it's like an ecom thing, but you sell it to this. Um, and his quote on that was, "Be okay with only getting whatever CPA basically that you're getting from them, uh, up until you figure out that they're making more money than you are for your leads and then you're in the wrong business." And I'm like, that's a very interesting like, you know, we have that, right, where we could we could farm stuff out to to the HRT or the this or the that or whatever. And it's like we don't want to play the game on purpose, but like I'm going to be, let's be real, like I saw that guy post the CAC to LTV multiples on some of these industries and it's like crazy. And I'm like, but that's just not our game on purpose. But a lot of these guys that probably is their game. And there's a very easy way to do that with partnerships and data selling and stuff that again I don't know the clients on this. So like do your own research because we don't do this. But like there's a lot of hidden economics. Oh yeah. Speaking of cacti, I saw I saw a dashboard from uh on tellah health and I was just like what the [ __ ] Yeah, give me so much FOMO. So much FOMO. Let's ignore it. I know guys in PR that were doing ecom that literally just dropped it all and went into tellahalth because they saw the numbers and just cook. Yeah, just cook. Yeah. Yeah. I think isn't stealth. I don't know. I think he talked I think I've heard him talk about it but I don't know enough about his stuff. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's crazy though. Um, next one we got on here. Add creatives for every type of platform that No, I don't like that one. Uh, how are your tracking analytics on the paid side? I have a disconnect figuring out my CPA for high ticket products from paid. Oh, I got this, too. I'm disorganized here. How do you do this? Okay. So, I'm going to say mine first and then you're going to embarrass me with your answer. Um so so due to the fact that I didn't have to build a lot of the things that I did from scratch um especially on the SAS side like we had a data science team and the stuff that they did was as far as rocket science that I could ever like I looked at like some of like the the models that they use and I was like Jesus Christ the only thing that I could do was they would just tell me hey here's the data this is what this looks like figure out a way to get this up but they actually had the visibility My stuff is as simple as you could get. My source of truth is always like me. Like that's like my number one thing. Like if you forget like attribution, you forget like all the just one like one blended metric like because it sounds like this guy. I have a disconnect figuring out my CPA for high ticket products from paid. How much have you paid and how much contribution dollars did you generate? And then how much revenue did you generate? It's kind of like there you go. Right. That's that's the answer that question. Um and then you have that distilled down based off of how many channels you're doing. So, how much did you spend through Facebook? Okay. How much did you make from Facebook attributable revenue? And I am not the guy to talk to about attribution models. You would cook me here. Um, I have tried I've done like the data driven. I've done like the last click, first click. Like I keep I keep my like Facebook attribution windows like on the default, right? Like I do um it's just default attribution. So, I I couldn't tell you. It's because we were primarily on Facebook. And what I care about more is since I'm a copyright, I care more about what ad and messaging kind of like converted to the sale versus and so that's as simple as just having creative IDs and making sure that you're tagging every prospect that came through like with like your unique link tracking and all that stuff. Having the tags in the CRM is as basic as that. Um and then that's as much as I do on the analytics. I want to see okay this ad spent this ad spent 200 generated you know a thousand in pipeline in actual like ACV this ad generated you know spent 200 and it generated 1 1500 what are the differences between the ads that could have contributed to that ACV let me cross reference the actual sales call recording and like the forum data and then maybe I'll make some lead scoring model right um now what I'm getting into right now which oh my god please help me with this um we'll talk about this after I'm trying to do cohort reportbased like lifts. So I want to see cuz obviously when you're in lead genen, it's not just like your first seven days, right? It's not like all performance-based. You have 30, 60, 90, one, 120 day lift on a thing because of whatever activity that you have in there. Like all your sales reps are going through your pipeline. So I want a way to do cohort based so I can attribute certain behaviors that we did on the sales enablement side. Maybe like a new retargeting campaign, whatever. Cool. Cohort. uh May 1st through 7th had 30% 90day lift because we did this thing versus cohort May 7th through 14th had XYZ lift because we did this thing now, right? Um which I know I was looking I know there's a way to do that on HubSpot. I think it's like technically kind of whatever. Um but yeah, that's my answer there. Now please cook me. There's no cooking to be had. I know I mean the call side of it. So a lot of things. So the for lead genen, let's start there. So the guys that I was running marketing tech basically like they're just friends like I was just building this stuff out and I was learning while doing it. So I was just happy to do it and that was just like a fun game. And for them there there's different games to be played where if you're getting paid CPA you're getting paid you know on whatever hurdle on a call if you're getting paid on these different things. number one thing. So, they're running on Red Track. All those tools work, the volume, the red track, this that, the other things for this model of lead genen because all you're doing is just making sure that click ID just carries through everywhere and it goes everywhere it possibly goes. And again, this is a one. This is singular. This is not built for omni. Oh, they clicked on my this and this and this and this and where did they go from here to this is not what this is built for. This is built for like this is what they clicked. This is the action they took. And then how far can you carry that click ID throughout? So they then get on a call, it's pushed and it's inside Ringba now. They then are inside Ringba and it goes to whoever else's retriever account for the actual buyer, let's say. Then it's in uh there and it goes to their CRM for their ACA. And then in 7 days from now they actually place a policy or in 30 60 days they get paid on it or whatever. and setting up triggers all the way over there to come back to the beginning with time stamp with whatever like with what you need of the conversion and what type and the amount and everything is like the long tail version of that and they're going to come in in four different places and all that but like you're kind of not going to care. Let's be like in that model. Um and that's how that's how we were doing it for that. So we that's how we knew the actual pay amounts the all that. Um and we would bring that back generally to red track. It's like what layer do you want to bring it? Right? You have like your ads, you have your say meta, you have which has its pixel on thing, you have your red track which houses all of your initial and then you have all these other systems it goes to that have actions that need to come back into red track. So you at least can see there and then it's up to you to decide if you then want to cook the pixel on that because then you can send in you can have custom conversions in here of things you know that you choose not to bring to Facebook. Uh you can have things you choose, right? So that's how we did on the lead genen side of things and there's a million other better ways I'm sure to do it but that was like the clean way with what we do with the call funnel the different funnel. So what you said about HubSpot is you're just going to store as much data as possible on your own side. Uh, and that can be custom, that can be within HubSpot, that can be custom plus HubSpot or whatever. That can also be high roast. Um, and it can be a mix of all those, right? So, you're going to store everything inside there as much as possible, including like ad ids and all that. And then you're going to have those all inside on basically server side, which is what Hyros does, right? It does its own version of server side. You do your own version of server side, whatever. Just pick a source of truth. And then the big thing like what you said is like the reporting that exists within a HubSpot where you have someone opted in on this date and you know the ad ID or whatever. Sure. But then the bigger thing is like knowing the time too of these other pieces like you said your cohorts because then you have an application date, you have a booking date, you have a booked for date, you have a close date and then these ones recycle because they book a second call or they do this. But you can build out all that reporting inside HubSpot to know like your time too of things. And then you can layer it in by add attribution or whatever. And then also all of this is going into Hyros which is the one that I found so far is the most beautiful view of your multi-touch because that's the issue is when you get the attribution models like scientific generally speaking is like what most people are going to base off 30-day there. It's like what initially got it within the generalized window of how long it takes someone which you need to track for them to go from lead to right from first click to close. So if it's within 30 days, you're going to use scientific 30, let's just say, and you're going to run it on that. And that one chose the best journey because if not, you have to build something custom that looks at your hubspot data and is like this and this and this and they clicked on these pages and like it's just Hyros is so clean for that. Um, but to go like a little deeper, we don't use HubSpot or I'm sorry, uh, Hyros for cooking the pixel. We use a custom setup for that just because it has better matching and like cleanliness. So we are kind of doing like making decisions on this data but like feeding based on this data which I kind of don't love in alignment and we'll see where that navigates over time but this tool that's custom eventually probably could just look like hyros because it has all the touch points so you could just do it but they just don't have a good viewer right now so I don't like it because I like to see. So yeah I mean we're saying we're saying the same thing. Okay. Is that tool Don't don't have to share everything, but is that tool um kind of a hybrid of kind of like an out of the box like kind of white glove thing that you had to customize or was it like fully fully custom built from the ground up like internal for the feeding the pixel? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We used essentially Yeah. We used a service of contract guys that basically came in and you know built it out for us, tested things and for us it was that's when we also moved to native events because we weren't on there forever and their big thing is matching. So like they're like these two charts need to perfectly match for server and uh browser. So it was like an absolute dance to make it so that the server ones that came in were in alignment with what was actually happening on page because of in callunnel or whatever you don't know which then all like it it's multi-touch. It's all over the place. Um and then same thing with the routing is making sure like you can do it very simply where it's like if they answer this route them to this page. If they answer this route them to this page but then you have two different calendarly booking widgets or you're passing in hidden fields. you're doing that kind of stuff and then how those actually back out into units is where we then also solve for browser and server on purchase through a Zoom or phone or whatever where which is crazy because the person isn't filling out the information, right? So, how do you get the browser, right? So, like the person has to be doing the action on the device. Yeah. So, we we built it out to where we have customized terms pages that they sign that's included in the purchase, but they fill those out and that's actually what fires the server side. Um, yeah. So, it's like we get we get the I'm sorry, the browser and the server side. So, they fill out that form, they fill in all the information that's basically like a purchase. It is a purchase, but it's post purchase. And they'll go to that one time. So, you can't just throw it in a membership site and fire your purchase every 12 seconds when someone loads page. You have to do it on something that's one time but post-purchase slash into the purchase process. So we do that and then you're going to feed every you're going to then do a lookup of all that information in HubSpot. You're gonna have all your server side information of the initial attribution, the initial click, the init ad ID, the everything plus all the other information you've gathered and you can send the most full picture beautiful as a server side event the second that that thing fires off on browser. I'm gonna when this launches I'm going to replay this in that entire portion that you just said about 10 times. Yeah, there are people raw with server side only uh and have nothing on page for high ticket backend purchase and [ __ ] probably cook us on rorowaz. So like that's just a thing that we are doing and like are trying to optimize for. But like yeah is it necessary? No. Did we run it and do 60 whatever million before we made that change? Yes. like did we use customer conversions and what like I don't know where I stand on that still to this day but I know that people have had really good success with it on low ticket because of the matching is so much better. The high ticket stuff is still questionable in my opinion on like this delay and like it sounds like it should be better and you're giving them the right feed the right information at the better like the accurate times um and the more full picture but I just don't know if that's actually the case. I mean, yeah. Too many variables to say, "Oh, we changed that and that's what made everything better." Yeah. I think I found you were talking about like the hiring a kid who just like work basically my little slave and then I'll teach him some stuff about my stuff and he'll just like just just do stuff for me. That was that was me, by the way. That was me applying for Luke. That was literally Luke saying, "I'm going to teach someone all marketing, sales, funnels, copy, all this." And I booked a call on his calendar and built sales pages for him every six like and got paid a thousand bucks every six weeks. And next thing you know, we're like business partners fully in this and then we're a call funnel and then we're here. So like I don't d that grind. I love that grind. It's just like me too. That was me too. Yeah. Yeah. It just cost person more to do it. Exactly. Yeah. You're right. Because you have to spend time training. I think hormones was talking about that too. Like I'll work for free isn't an offer for you for for the person because they have to spend their very high value time training you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I want to I want someone who understand I need to understand this stuff because that's mark ops and that's really where I'm lacking. Yeah. Um, do you do only affiliate or have your own? No. What traffic source? No. Everyone pushes outbound. Okay, let's do this. Everyone pushes outbound lead genen hard for professional services. So, PE investment banking private credit. If you want to use media buying, how would you structure a campaign when targeting established B2B? What is that different from consumer? So I think you kind of talked about this with callfunnel uh and like B2B versus B TOC, but just the top portion. So everyone pushes outbound lead genen for those services, but how would you do inbound? So I'll talk to you about my experience running ABM campaigns for um for for the enterprise portion of the SAS company that I was in. So we had like a PLG motion. Um it was kind of like they kind of eventually like shut it down because they realized like oh [ __ ] like just our activation. It was a free trial pl 14-day trial and then they were hoping to like ascend them and like I did some work on the activation rate like it it was decent but their whole goal was like same thing like here with your info product it was like ascension rate into like the enterprise plans just was not working and this is the case with like 90% of SAS um PLG like PLG motions and so I transitioned to working on the enterprise side we had a director of demand genen who was like an absolute wizard with like ABM campaigns so I'm going to say this. I'm going to preface now. Anyone like for like if you ask the question, look up accountbased marketing, go on to LinkedIn, look up guys like Chris Walker. Like if you're in like act like SAS SAS, like either VC backed or if you're bootstrap or like you're just in the SAS world, look up the guy. His name is Chris Walker. He has a podcast called Revenue Vitals. Listen to him religiously. He's like he does exclusively nine and 10 figure SAS companies. Like he exclusively works with them and he gives you all the sauce. look him up because what I'm about to say is probably outdated number one and probably I don't remember everything number two that was the biggest like these deal sizes were like3 to9 million contracts and they would like sell them out on a contract basis like 12 to 24month contracts and they're worth like anywhere between like three and nine it was like only established like enterprise stuff and so we would do ABM whereas accountbased and we'd use a platform um kind of like a I think it's demand sense I think they changed it but it's basically like a demand like we'll give you information on what companies are one visiting your website and two searching for XYZ thing. So basically it's just like market intelligence. So like these companies are currently looking for XYZ solution, right? Or these companies are searching up this right or these companies are engaging with XYZ content, right? And they kind of fed you that list. And so then what we would do is we would run either like we ran a um a webinar funnel which is it was this was the funniest thing to me is like seeing a webinar funnel work in enterprise like 3 to9 million contract SAS and then also info like l like webinars are everywhere in B2B SAS but we we ran like a webinar event um targeting the full account so you have it's kind of like a waterfall thing so you have your your like decision makers which are usually not like your seuite but they're maybe like VP PS and managers and like product leads and all like stuff like that. So like we had to understand who within that account list we wanted to target because they could one make the decisions very important and then two understood the problem enough to push for that problem to be solved. This is like a problem that I ran across was targeting the wrong person. I would go for the VP like yeah they had buying power they just weren't close enough to the problem to actually want to solve it. Right. Like right that's like it was so huge. I was like well duh. And so we had to build out like our actually target list and then from there it was very simple. We would run uh we would run like custom audience uh campaigns on LinkedIn and I think they did I this is where I'm I kind of get lost because someone else was handling like all these platforms in terms of the distribution they were doing I believe display network as well just to that targeted account list very small and then we'd have the SDR team work on every single person on that account list as well at the same exact time so it's both inbound and then outbound motions too. I think they're very relevant content. And then this is where the this is where the data team got in and they were looking at okay like we need like we need to know exactly like what kinds of uh what kinds of websites or claims or like creative like ads here on the display network people in this account that are VPs are clicking. So we know that we need to push those harder or switch it. And the same thing for like the product leads that we were targeting etc. very complic like very complicated. I'm not giving it justice like this operation justice because it was not me who built this thing. I was just within it. Um that's the best example that I can genuinely give on like professional services huge contract values with uh paid media but like again I was running a little bit less like not as big investment banking private credit PE. Um, I'm assuming they're trying to target these people. Like, you can absolutely run Facebook ads, like a just a straight up good ad, and get leads like this. Like, if your pixel is good enough and if you know that the market is on there, you can absolutely run Facebook ads to get those people to opt in or do whatever you want them to do. Um, you just have to understand that your cost is probably going to be absolutely insane and that is totally okay. Don't try to like be like, oh, like I need my CPMs now to be like, come on, you're targeting [ __ ] PE firms. Like if your economics on the back end supporting it and you know that then just keep running it. You know it's going to be expensive. So just be realistic with the expectations, you absolutely run Facebook ads to get those people 100%. Yeah. Yeah. I had conversations uh early on in my version of this uh that was basically around helping private equity firm get deal flow for a specific niche. So like call it dentist or whatever and trying to find them because they do link they do every outbound thing you can imagine. They have the whole, you know, corner office that's all they do is dial and then they get paid as percents. You know, when things hit LOI, they get this and they maybe get some deal close amount. And then they also have external like referral partners that'll get one or two or whatever. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it was five. I have no idea. But the uh transaction amount um they would get a portion of it as like referral. And I was like, that's a big think again monetization model like that makes sense. Like it's just how much cash flow do you have? And I ended up talking to a guy and he was like, "Yeah, the real game is to almost like have that entire sales floor." So basically get them to LOI. So which is way different, right? I mean, you're talking like 92 different things on that. And I don't know that world well enough, but like if you can get them to that stage and then deliver them, it's like the amount that you get is so much higher or you are the one actually doing the rollup yourself and then you just package it and sell it off to a private equity company with a bow on it. And it's like, you know, there's a lot of ways to take this skill set and use it across different industries, but we are eight over and we got one more and I need it. I need it. So, we have to finish the sheet. I can't not finish the sheet. How far over? Selling to women versus selling to men. You all know the good stuff. They look different. They have different trade-offs. They have different interests. They have different money, but time, all that stuff. So, we'll just general stroke of what what is the difference? GC. This is sad because this is the one thing that I really wanted to talk about cuz I know you sell to women and I had this entire thing from nothing held because this has helped me. No. Okay. Okay. Um, if you want to know how to sell to women really well, go to Nothing Held Back the Facebook group. It's free. It's open to anyone watching this. And there's a girl in there. I think her name is Lauren. I believe her name is Lauren. She talks about this stuff all day every day because she exclusively sells to women. I have not sold to women enough to give you like everyone like the best answer. I'll give you as much as I know from the data that I have. But if you really want to learn how to do it, go to open up Facebook. Nothing held back. You can probably just search selling to women and you'll see the post. But first, I'll preface it there. What I've seen with selling to women is the if you use the kind of bro marketing that a lot of this like let's say you're in info, right? Let's just use yours as an example. Um and I'm sure your CMO like he he's been known he's known this for like the past five years. If you use the same like kind of like bro marketing and bro messaging and vibe with and when I say vibe I'll go into that a bit later like with women you will put them off. And so what I've seen with women is if you try to have an ounce of remember what we like what we talked about with like the negative self- admittance. If you do that even a little bit, you can get away with it a little bit with men. Do it with women, you're cooked. Absolutely cooked. Women look for validation inherently more than men. We all look for validation. But more than men and my experience, they look for validation that they are okay. They are okay as they are now. which is really difficult when you're trying to do change work, right? It's very difficult to try to get them from like agitating pain, right? But also making sure that they know that they're okay. Difficult, right? And so what Lauren talk about, this is from post from her is instead of being like you have a problem, you say you could be better. you're already great as you are, but you could be even better, right? That is often used like that, at least according to people who've sold to way more women than I have, that's kind of like how you want to do it. Another thing that I've seen is like tonality and pacing matters a lot. Like a lot. You cannot be demeaning in your language or overtly aggressive. I've seen like if you have an ad and because like usually when you're selling to women you have like a female spokesperson like toning it down a little bit more and kind of having that more like friendly onetoone approach is like le on their same level not acting like you're talking to like at them but like you're talking with them I've seen works like really well. Um, and I'm saying that I don't know a lot about this because I was I was a copywriter for a female dating offer, teaching women how to get dates with highv value men. Um, and I was writing some copy, but we had a copy chief. And so he would like chief all this stuff and like he would kind of give me like these little pointers, but he would end up like doing like these massive reservations like when I first started in this like he would do all that stuff. That's like really the last time I sold to women. But he implanted this in me. It was like when when they tested like again that tonality really mattered and the the big thing was like do not tell them that they have a problem with themselves. Make them know that they're okay as they are. They could get better but that's like kind of where you want to end it. But I feel like you would have way more insight into this because you're actively doing it right now. So I want to hear your thoughts on this. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to be the first to say like I'm not in it enough to like I can give you some overarching but like these guys like you said CMO like they are pros at it. We have our copyriter that's written two emails a day every day plus every automation and script as brand face right like they are the ones who are in it. Um, we have had comments in uh nothing held back great group and I would definitely go there because there's a bunch in there but I think it was I think it actually was Lauren but she commented that she was a past customer of ours client and and then she loved it and all this stuff and that uh but FYI like you do have a bit of like bro marketing style stuff like we gave no and right and like yeah there's like there are males in the acquisition side of the company and then majority is female for sure but there's definitely some you know males over acquisition just how the cookie crumbles with this industry thus far. Um, and very happy to be in the other. Another good thing I learned um or perspective I had when in the group was someone was saying the difference in masculine versus feminine energy more so than you know gender and this isn't like a gender conversation but like the the thinking behind that. Um because you have women that maybe like for our stuff strong is new sexy like leans into like the kind of already harder and heavier approach not as soft and generic. So for ours, we kind of can dance that line in my opinion a little bit more where it shifts that um the high performance energy like we we lean in that which generally is back and forth. It's like of course there's a feminine energy and there's that whole thing and that's like the key pillar but there's like sprinkles of this. Um when it comes to actual like framing it's crazy like Alen talks about it like instead of having free bonuses you have free gifts. uh instead of having this there's like subtle stuff that they layer through there that's like you know discounts if your favorite thing that's $150 shirt is off 20% like that's a steal and like all this stuff like they they talked about that on a meeting literally last week about how how to frame and then the other piece is the for us right is the phone call and is how you navigate that and the framing before the phone call you can set in the application bring them through these states like uh Allen has a has a post in there that he talks about bringing them from X state to Y state throughout the journey so that by the time they're like kind of in pain still and like you said it's like you got to navigate that to where it's like yes they may understand they can't do it on their own but they don't need to feel like bad about like themselves and that's a thread the needle situation um and then on the actual phone call someone was posting about this Josh Gavin was talking about this about the difference in selling over the phone to men versus women and the different personas and again I'm going to use feminine energy and masculine energy when I say this but like the decision maker is often different in uh like the the overarching societal expectation or norm is like you know the the female wears the pants or whatever like that and that that persona owns it. So we don't have the same similarities of someone who sells MMO over the phone and the guy's like I got to talk to my wife before I drop 20 grand on this versus you have the female that like if it's the right frame and it's the right good thing and you're actually selling you know you're not bullying and you're not whatever but like there's a very clean way to make it so it's like that person generally makes the decision. That's again societal norm and you can kind of get them to that line and like we're super liberal with like refunds and stuff and if there's ever like something that would happen post purchase where there was a disagreement around that and it became a thing like you're good out of the program here's your money back like no no no worries but just knowing that dynamic and understanding the societal norms or what you think or based on your discovery process over the phone kind of feeling out where that sits um because that's also not true sometimes where it's very overarching uh with a spouse or with someone in life where they're like, you know, they need to be kind of like pulled through that and they might need the double check. But yeah, all the messaging we try and we took that feedback around the bro marketing thing I sent to the copyriter and he changed some stuff up. The CMO that came in and his like acquisition senior copyrighter whatever he brought in like they're very privy to this and have worked in this market. So, I'm sure they're great. I mean, they they and they also are like I don't know. My whole thing is like how you are as a person also like comes through and those guys are like you know uh girl dads and they are you know a wife and a daughter and they every you know marketing meeting are sharing client win channel stuff and are like the most hype in all the channels. So like they also like feel it and are it so I think it then comes through when it comes to copy. Um but you definitely got to double check. So yeah, that's that's actually a really important part that I didn't get to touch on yet. It's simple, so I won't drone on too much, but writing speaking like exactly like your avatar, like exactly like them. Um, so damn important. The same way like on a sales call because I had like train sales teams like I I've done sales like I'm good at it. I just hate doing it. Mirroring, right? It's like when the second that you mirror like all of a sudden like you're like people actually open up, right? Right? They actually let you talk. They're actually there. They're more engaged. You can literally hear that flip from when they're like resistance to now acceptance is when you mirror pacing, tonality. You get on the phone with someone, they're low energy, now you become low energy. Match them, right? Instead of there being that kind of that bump. And so it's very similar. It's the same exact thing in your copy and your ads. Like when we had a bunch of UGC creators creating content for us, I literally trained them on this. So I was like the same way that I trained my sales skill. like here's the prospect, here's the product, here's like everything in the surrounding, like here's the emotional states, like if it was like negative emotional state, positive emotional state, like XYZ, all that stuff. Like I would train the UGC creator on that because what people neglect all the time and I had a post about this is like pay attention to how Tony Robbins records his ads, the way he says the stuff like he's at this point he's gotten to such a level where he so inherently understands pacing and tonality that he can get on there and get you from hyped up to emotional to where he can play with your emotions so easily. Right? And for me I want to be able to do the same thing. But first, I have to match. And so I tell my UGC creators, hey, this market is in a low emotional state. Like I'll give my if if there's people here who like sell debt settlement right now. Like I'm going to give you some sauce. Like the entire market is in low emotional state. So look up my because I know we're already over time. Look up my tweet about emotional states. Look up Allen's Allen's Facebook post on Nothing Held Back about low emotional states as well. Um and it tells you like how you need to give them a reason why they're in this thing. Um not how to solve it because they're low emotional state. They want a reason why they're in the thing. So, you introduce that first. What I love to do is shift blame. Blame someone besides themselves because low emotional state people, they will not take blame on themselves. Like that just gets them into even a lower emotional state. Shift blame to something else. Usually the system and you'll see these kinds of ads everywhere once you actually understand the structure of how this copy actually works. You'll see this everywhere now. Shift the blame to something else, right? some other thing, the system, the man, Uncle Sam, whatever, whoever you want it to be that's re relevant to your avatar, right? And then now you introduce yourself as the hero, right? As the hero who's fighting back or this system, if you want to be even more nuanced, as this the mechanism is the thing that's fighting back, not necessarily your company or your offer, but like the mechanism is the thing that's fighting back. So if anyone's doing debt settlement, that's how you like think about that and like make some math and then come back to me. Um, and so that tonality matching is so important. And that's like the one thing that I would say like that's a very easy thing to optimize for. Like you can literally keep the same script, the same everything. If you just change the way that the ad is presented and how if you have a UGC grader or you yourself is saying it like if you just can modulate and I would like remember the Wolf you know the Wolf of Wall Street um clip where he's like um by the time you read about it in the New York papers it's already too late like that I swear like do that stuff and like just watch what happens seriously watch what happens and that's something that I'm very diligent about now when I have creators or me myself or someone else recording like a talking head ad. Very diligent about it. Very diligent about it. So yeah, this was gas. This is 3 hours of pure sauce. That is unbelievable. I have to sprint out of here. But this was You're going to have to do round two and three and four, I'm sure, and just keep this rolling because I Where did Where do people find you? Because they're going to want more of this sauce. Where do they find you? Uh literally just Twitter. That's the only place that I am. Uh buyer of Media is my username on Twitter. Um, yeah, find me there. I'm gonna be sharing more sauce. I'm gonna make a group for people to come together, share ideas, share sauce, share off. So, it's gonna be nice. Completely free, too. I love it. All right. Anyone who's still here, you got to comment. We're just going to say 3.5. Just just there and that'll count. All right, man. Well, this was fantastic. I will have this uploaded tonight when I get back from this event I'm supposed to be at 20 minutes ago, and we will call it a day. All right. Good, dude. This is fantastic. This pure pure value. I love it. Thank you so much for having me. I'm honored for real. Yeah, dude. 100%. 100%. All right, you guys know where to find him. Talk to you tomorrow. Today is day 84, maybe. We'll see.
