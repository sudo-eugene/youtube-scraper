# inside my INFO DIET... what I'm focused on this month | EP60
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8mrAG1Eg3c

In today's video, I'm going to be talking about my current info diet as of May 2025. All of these topics here are things I have either been stuck on before or I forecast that I will be. So, I'm learning about them now. Everything from personal operating system, sales team, ops, backend, economics, and cash flow, and so much more. So, we're going to break them down and go into the topics that I'm learning about. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with a goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Uh, I was initially going to make this and share like the actual channels and stuff. I think I'll make a separate one for that, but we're going to go through the topics and like why I'm currently studying these. Um, I'm a big believer in like the one thing. So, I'll go through what like the one thing is right now, but I have my pulse on all these. So podcasts, books that are coming like chat GBT conversations at 5 a.m. like all of them are around these and I'm going to go into why and then we'll talk about the main one that's currently the blocker. So personal operating system things that I've identified for me personally uh that I need more or less like focus on uh deep work. So I will either have meeting back to back to back to back to back or I will have full empty days and I am just not efficiently hitting the deep work. When I first started doing these videos, it was like a fun new thing. And it was really easy to get up at five every single day, do these for two, three uh two, three hours and get them done. And now, like even with a full day uh or an empty day, I will like, you know, this is 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday of doing this. And I should not be doing that. And it's just bad management. So, I'm focusing on deep work and how to do that. So, I basically buy it by the calendar. So, if I can fit it onto the calendar, it happens. And I'm not even doing that. So, this is a big one. Dopamine reset. everything from quick scrolling to freaking nicotine to what you can imagine. Uh it is frying things that I'm doing in a short-term basis in work. And so I needed like a reset of that. So I have like eliminated so much of the stuff that is just like scroll and this and that and trying to focus on this. Um I'm still pretty bad at it honestly, but I have identified this as like a core piece that is broken here. Routines. Same thing there. It kind of just goes back to the calendar. I like thrive off routines. Uh you hear a lot of people talk about like if you don't hit your routine and then it like throws off your whole day and like I lean into that camp and that is not good. Um I don't want that but I also like when I'm in routine but I need to be able to be adaptable outside of it. So trying to evolve back from that but mainly I think solving for with the calendar thing and where I'm going with this is I have hired a personal biz coach that I work with every Monday every other Monday that is just like all about productivity structuring out calendar structuring out like thinking backwards from goals. Um, and right now it just more or less feels like I'm just like in the trenches and not as much focus like future focused. Um, someone I'm gonna name at least a specific on this one. Dan Martell, I think he does a fantastic job. Watch all his stuff uh that goes back and forth more so lifestyle. Like I'm a big believer in basically, you know, like I always say on this, but like listening to people who have what you want um in a specific aspect of their life. So like just because someone has a cranking business that you want to emulate does not mean that they have a good personal life that you want to emulate. And you need to be able to identify that. um Dan, at least from what he shows externally and from people I've heard that have worked with him, he has a kind of full encompassed setup. So, I really like to kind of consume a lot of his content and look at how he lives as well as what he talks about. Um, and then some of his like books and like he just came out with a new SAS book that's fantastic and you can apply it into, you know, our world of info and coaching. But yeah, I think he's like an all-around good guy that I think operates by this. Um, another one is Oh man, I'm blinking so hard, but the guy who had the Fantasy Factory, I'm blinking. Oh, Rob Deer Deck. So Rob Deer Deck has a really good one around this as well and he has a whole personal operating system. So I like guys like that who talk data systems structure uh around their personal lives as well and like fully block that out. They still have like you know deep work but they have deep personal they have deep friends you know like they go in all those buckets and I think I do a terrible job of that. So I'm trying to focus on learning that AI infra leverage. Um so what I'm trying to focus on here right now and I'm posting all over X like trying to get feedback and learn things through NAN and places like that. um or learn about Nan through X and where everyone's pointing me on YouTube. So, I'm consuming a ton of it and then to be candid, I'm giving a ton of it off to my senior tech lead who is going through and as the first layer, we're going to replace and enhance all of our current automations. So, we use 3 million or something like that Zaps a month. We have custom databases that we store for like analytics tool of our coaching, all these things and uh a ton of stuff in the sales and marketing front. So the first goal of using AI is basically just to replace enhancements, I'm sorry, replace automations and then go through and enhance them. So where can we leverage actual AI because that's just an automation replacement and that's just a cost savings. But I want to be able to do it and enhance and layer it into current systems. So we have so many things that happen in the marketing sales front that are automated but could be enhanced through automation either by literally adding things to them or cleaning pieces or um lead scrubbing. Like there's just so many other pieces that we haven't touched. So I want to do that first and then I want to focus on roles. So everything from a billing admin to customer support to the coaching system and figure out the best ways to replace but mainly enhance like kind of how we do now. Um, I think there's always going to be a piece, not always, but you know, for a long future, uh, a place for the role. It's just going to be enhanced, which ideally, let's use a simple example, but if someone has 50 clients per coach, we can enhance how they do their role through AI and they can take a hundred, their cost can slightly go up, but the cost overall to the company would go down. So, it' be really nice. So, that and then I also am focusing on some version of a personal AI. Everything I talk about on here when I use GPT is like my basically store just master threads that I use. And I know that's not like the best long-term future way to do it. So having one that would be trained up on all the context like I have certain threads, but like an all-encompassing that I could personally use either local um or you know essentially local, but that is you know custom to me. So I think that would be very helpful for me. So again, these are all like my current info diet where I'm consuming all of this is all going to be YouTube. I've not bought a course. I have a coach for this which is paid. So speedrun a bit there. Um I buy books on these all the time. These this is all free right now. I haven't bought anything um which is actually interesting but we pay I mean I pay for a lot of softwares and then senior tech leads in there and I play around but I haven't fully bought or done anything. All this is free info funnel and conversion scaling. I was going to tweet about this or X or whatever you call it now um about this but essentially I'm just consistently looking for different funnel types. So go to that conference open my mind a lot on webinars, web classes, challenges, CMO talks about all these different things and I like to stay focused. I mean, we did one uh VSSL opt-in funnel that was 70 million. Like, we don't need it doesn't need to be crazy, but also there's just different ways for the messaging and framing based on the economics. Um, that can change based on like the different funnel types. You can do a ton of volume that liquidates. Um, you know, the lower ascension rate, for example, as long as the math or the economics work. You can do more the straight line, what we do. You can go DTA and go straight to it, which is way cheaper. So, we're testing these things right now, but I'm just like learning about all of them and I'm doing it inside. Nothing held back Facebook group is a big one that I do. Um I don't really have any podcasts that talk about this because I like to watch them or read them more than I do listen to them. Um but yeah, I think that's I think that kind of sums that piece up. The direct response is really a future piece of this where especially if we have a lot of low ticket, it's going to be very direct response heavy marketing team is building out and we'll get to that down here with like team and or design sales team ops. This is if I was to say there's one thing right now, this is the one. Um and we are basically I don't want to say solved for it but we definitely started the process. We have had marketing issues for a long time got the CMO in and solved for that. So even up there like they are coming up with the ideas. I just like to be privy to what is happening or like have a finger on the pulse in the market so I can understand and maybe give either opinion or random options or look at look at what they're doing in like a different light. So that's the goal there. Um, but with the sales team ops, we just brought a new uh cso in and he started, you know, three days ago, so it hasn't even touched it yet. Um, but I think it's going to be a huge shift, which is then going to be more purchases on colder and more volume. Uh, which is just going to feed back to marketing and like it's going to change the entire machine. So, that's kind of like betting on an unknown, but I have pretty strong conviction in that just based on our stats and based on multiple people we interviewed all saying the same things like in a vacuum. So, uh, basically, yeah, how to structure that team for scale. The compensation framework is a big one. Like our current setup is very, very wrong. Uh, so I've heard just like different, you know, just not incentivizing the right things, not tying to numbers in the correct way, not having thresholds on the right things. And yeah, so I'm excited to change that up. Renewal framework, it's a sales function. We haven't launched that back end. We're going to, I believe it's actually tomorrow, and that's going to be a sales function, but live within a CS and fulfillment team. So, trying to figure that out and understand how that works. And I think I go into it down here, but I've just bought like eight books talking about gamification and community management, like trying to incentivize people to stay in a community as like a lifer style thing, not just for like these upfront activation points to get XYZ result. Like really build community that's extremely sticky. Um, because I think that's going to be a big piece for enterprise value in the future. So talking about how to basically do the renewal piece and in the sales process, but then also get them to be sticky, which is kind of more of this like team and back end. I think actually I talk about in here, but uh supporting leaders, how to support the team in here to like not overstep. I think we maybe did that a little too much in the past and I don't want to do that in the future one because it's not scalable and I don't think I'm the best by any means and all in sales world um and there are people much better. So just making sure they have the tools and the data they need and that comes down to this tracking and dashboards. I've done this myself forever and I think it'll be very important into the future to have somebody and have so just basic basically understanding a broader picture of this. So I'm looking at like gamified dashboards for consumers. I'm looking on B2B side. I'm looking at it in sales world and I'm actually trying to plug these into all parts of the company in a way that incentivizes the right behavior and shows the right metrics. So this is big and I want to hire for this actually. So, I'm trying to learn it more so I can like hire the right people because I want to understand how the data works um behind it. Backend economics and cash flow. I talk about this all the time now, but liquidation timelines, cash collection, financing. So, external thirdparty financing could be a big lift that we I think I get to make an announcement or like something to the sales team this week. We are finalizing a new one. the cash collection periods like all of this basically talking about the risk and finance portion of the company has always been just like I don't say not paid attention to but just like we've just been pushed so much cash it didn't really like matter to us it wasn't a big focus didn't matter if we had an 82% cash collection 85 or 90 say like for us at the time we're just ramming volume and we were focused on the front end which was stupid at the time and I don't want to get caught holding the bag on the way up next time so this uh margin drift is huge I'm trying to lock everything in now where we're at with you a little bit sub two million a month and make sure that now when we scale back up and go 30 50 100 that I have it locked so I have like automated reporting that comes in I have source of truth for the data of the marketing sales and finance part tied together because that was a big piece um some payment orchestration platform stuff I was tweeting about this today or exing I don't know what the [ __ ] you're supposed to say but um payment orchestration platforms because we have a lot of risk sitting in stripe we have very very low chargeback like point whatever three something like that But I just have heard that storing the tokens and and the subscriptions is going to be better somewhere else. So I've been trying to like research and do all these. Again, when I say like my info diet, it's like I have podcasts about this [ __ ] I have YouTube videos. I will sit here for eight hours and just like watch YouTube videos about how people build NAM things and build them on the side. I will watch Cole Gordon videos talking about sales ops. I will watch everybody you've ever heard of talk about funnels and conversion. Jeremy Haynes, Alen Sultanic, AI stuff. I don't even know their names. I just watch like every nen thing you guys tag me in. back end economics and cash flow. A lot of time it's horos for like the info side and then these are like OG people who like buy businesses and like not private equity is the wrong word but like the online boring business people talk about a lot of these and a lot of people don't in our world. Um so yeah I just I'm like trying to find pockets of this from I don't want to say other industries but like other pockets of the industry and try and learn from that. So hopefully that makes sense. And then gross profit breakdowns. We've never had different offers that we really had to think about this. So I'm trying to understand the volume requirements for the different ones to hit like ideal gross profit breakdowns things like group coaching the info like coach onetoone coaching is pretty locked in but you just have to do x amount of volume in order to you know all that stuff how much what's our you know consistent overhead now that we have these certain team members that are variable but not tied to overall revenue but have like different KPIs. So like try and build comp models and there are people out there that can just do this but I I like to understand it a little bit before I hire for it. So that's where I'm going with that team and org design re-roll organization. Um, so that doesn't make sense, but basically I mean just like the different roles and instructuring actual making sure there's less overlap so we can clean up roles and make sure that we have, you know, everyone on the boat is needed and in the right positions. So is basically what that means. I'm doing new mate meeting cadence. So I've been doing like EOS style books and stuff like that. Um, and I do these like leading up to basically. And then department level ids and department level budgeting. Those start this week. So I moved and changed the meeting structure. So now we're gonna have a fulfillment ops. We're gonna have a tech ops. We're gonna have a marketing ops and a sales ops that I will be leading for with the department heads of each instead of we have our master one that's like all the team in one operating group. And it's basically what's going on every department back and forth. This is going to be one dedicated to them with essentially their own project list that exists. Um so that'll be super nice. And then I'm getting budgets built out with like expense sheets that they're tied to and that they are responsible for. I pulled the tech one for example. That's how this entire NATO end conversation began because I saw our Zap bill and I hadn't seen it and I don't know how long because I don't have my eyes on it and because I don't have other people having their eyes on it which is the bigger issue that this will solve. So being you know compensating with oh you save us 10 grand a month on whatever and you know I'll give you two or what you know whatever the number is. Um, but just having them own their own budgets. Doing the same thing with marketing, trying to keep it under X percentage of net new revenue, um, or net new cash, how we do it. So, you know, if we're doing a million a month in net new cash, how big should the sale or should the marketing team be like the total fee and what percent like what dollar is that? So, knowing that we might be fat going into it, but then that it can't rise over X% in the future and then having them manage that and manage their team and then building to replace myself in this entirety. So I'm trying to build it in a structured way, not just duct tape together from the get. So learning from a lot of people who can do that so that I can plug in an operator later when I don't want to be on meetings for 16 hours a week. Um probably more than that, but just for that part. So and then the data for each department, which is basically just comes back to this budgeting. So it's data and finance. So there's like the non-financial metrics that we track and then there's the actual like company specific metrics like retention numbers or uh escalations or uh customer support response times or whatever. So like pulling what's important for each department and then content flywheel and brand scaling. This is like me and the business. So I look at this for my stuff and then I also look at this for the business. Once I started doing it a little bit more for myself, I realized how kind of I don't want to say like dropping the ball but missing we were on how much content output we have in the business. Um, so yeah, bu put putting an organic engine together for the business. Um, schedule and reach for personal basically being able to do stuff into the future and in different pockets. Right now I focus on very specific and I kind of like that but organ I I'll see um I've been doing research on other people and talking to other people who like like to own keyword phrases. So I watch things like uh Mark Scales brands, Mark runs brand like whatever Mark runs ads. He's hilarious. Um I watch all his stuff and talk to him. Um, I watch Leila for this stuff a lot of the time. She has a lot of good stuff here. And then again, back to like EOS and like proper org chart, um, you know, team building style stuff a lot on YouTube. And then I have a ton of books that are actually on that that um, I'm actually not reading right now, but I read right before I did the last roll out. And this is going to be important to me as I start to like actually operate these because I don't like to show up and look like an idiot if they're not good. Um, these I already talked about clipping personal and business. I see all the stuff around clipping. I just don't want the wrong audience. So, I have tons of people in DMs talking about how to do it for me. And then I'm also trying to consider if we can do it for the business, but it would probably be for something low ticket because the other issue is if we have a mass volume increase, whether that's affiliate, whether that's clips, whether that's whatever, and they have the wrong quality of audience and it's also too much, it'll break the back end because everything requires a phone call. So, trying to like navigate lightly on this so we're not like hitting the wrong countries, hitting the wrong target demo. And that's both for me personally. I don't want 10,000 followers on something if they're just like not the right person. I would rather organically do it with like high quality. So, I do think this is extremely interesting. I just don't know how we'd use it in ours. Um, and then that also leads from cold for or for from organic. Um, I bought the AFL thing from EMO and I buy [ __ ] everything. And, uh, he talks a lot about this and how a majority of their stuff has come from that and we just have so much content that we haven't optimized for. We made like there was a video on the business page that did like 38 times the normal views got all this stuff got over a thousand followers is like responsible for you know a bunch of new inflow of apps bookings call you know all that stuff and it's like oh my gosh we do however many videos a week for however many years and like that's the first one like that stands out that did that just shouldn't be like that. So that and then this low ticket community as we start to do more volume like it goes from like top of funnel organic to the next layer which is like a paid version of it or actually a free community and then a paid community potentially or just straight to high ticket. So we're trying to navigate how to do that and then the the community portion I talked about uh up here is going to be part of this backend uh economics that we're actually going to map out. I didn't put it up here did I? I didn't. But talking about that backend program and keeping it super sticky. I think that is going to be huge and that is also going to be more brand scaling because there's going to be brand elements ambassadors stuff like that. So this is like where my focus is. I don't know if this is directly info diet. Um maybe we'll do a better one. I see people do those charts where it's like I consume you know hormone this I do you know I mean if I have my YouTube thing open here but if I look it's like I have lead genen guys. I have founder startup guys who don't take uh VC money Iman Nick Bear Jeremy Haynes. Um who else we got? Diary of Diary of a CEO. I watch SEO guys. I watch health guys like fitness style. Actually, I don't really watch those, but I follow them still. Yeah, Mark Builds Brand says hilarious live limiting beliefs. Uh, paid media left and right, all of those. So, whatever. I basically I'm just plugged into a lot of same things you guys are. I just kind of intently watch certain ones um that I focus on and then pay for their stuff if I can find it. So hopefully this gives an insight as to what I'm focusing on currently. Business sameish spot. It's one point whatever high ones. So haven't broke two yet, but sales manager just started. I think that in itself is going to take it to three again and then 35ish. And then we have some stuff cooking that will take it from 5 to 8. And yeah, that's where the current setup is. So getting ahead of this so that when it does become time to need these, I hopefully will be privy enough to either be able to hire for it or solve it myself. when I need to. So proactive versus last time I was reactive slash never even did it and we didn't hold the margin. So that's what I got and that's the update daily doc here. I have tech marketing sales ops all the things sorted into this doc of every video. This is the 60th one in a row I believe. Um I need to probably make a new series style that is going to be like specific like a toz building one of these or something like that. So, drop some comments with some ideas because I don't want these to get dry and me just go through. But this is it. This is what we do every day. Same [ __ ] over and over. So, appreciate you guys. Talk on X or IG or whatever. Talk soon.
