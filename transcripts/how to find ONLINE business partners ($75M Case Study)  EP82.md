# how to find ONLINE business partners ($75M Case Study) | EP82

In today's video, we're going to be talking about finding partners in business. I've had failed partnerships and successful partnerships that have gone on to do $75 million in sales. So, we're going to talk about the three different levels of partners you can have, the different experience and skill stacks you both bring to the table, where to find quality partners, and final questions to ask yourself before you sign anything. All right. Last year, we did $30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over $75 million in total cash collected in our partnership info coaching business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. Now, quick on my story, and then we're going to tie back as we go through these levels and experience, what went right and what went wrong with these. But the very first one, I was probably 18, 19 at the time, and we started like a private equity independent sponsor deal. We're essentially finding a deal. We were getting funding for it and we were going to co-own, you know, a portion of it. Um, and yeah, the deal got basically to the final hour ended up falling through and the partner I had throughout the whole thing, uh, I thought we were going to be able to, you know, continue on and try and do another deal because we had XYZ cash that we had, you know, put in slash, you know, raised. And in the end, the partner the entire time I was, you know, living with and working and doing all this stuff, uh, had been spending that cash. So, just like partnership fail number one. Um, the next one I just did a lot of stuff solo for a while. Um, just kind of tinkering online and then ended up landing with Make Mainco, who I talk about on the channel all the time. So we now have done over 75 million in this and I'm going to talk about why this went well for us. Um so that was a big success and then in times throughout this process I've tried to set up something on the side and done little things and I'll talk about why those failed and the approach I took that failed right so things I've learned levels. There's essentially three different levels and this is how I'm looking at this and these are all my opinions. No ego nothing but these are my opinions. So you have three different levels of people that you can partner with. One is going to be essentially like a mentor and that gets bad connotation but is essentially someone that is further ahead of you in some aspect or some situation. So let's say they're financially ahead of you. They are skill set ahead of you. They are in this specifically ind in this specific industry or niche ahead of you uh where they have this right. So you're helping them execute on XYZ. Cons of this is a lot of time they can be misaligned. So whether that's comp, whether that is how you're viewed as like a high leverage employee. Um there's a lot of ways to structure this and this kind of gets into like deal structure and all that which I don't really want to go into. Um but yeah, this is essentially bucket one. So you're partnering with someone. You're the executor. You are the mentee in this situation for this mentor and you are helping fuel this. Okay. Now the next is going to be the most common and that's going to be the trencher. That's going to be someone who is side by side you who has a shared vision has you know complimentary but you know diff differing skills so that you are you know 1 plus 1 equals 10 not two. Um cons of this a lot of time is you're splitting what is very small and unless you get it to size um simple math but you know if you're trying to make 100 grand a month and you do it solo you would have to you know get to 100 grand a month. If you have a business partner 50/50 you have to get to 200. So, it really does need to be a oneplus 1 equals more mentality because if it's something you could do on your own or if there's too much overlap, um it can be a lot harder to get to those bigger numbers that you can share in. Okay. And then life, I'll kind of get into this a little bit later, but life happens and uh especially at these levels where there maybe not isn't as much experience. Um things happen in people's personal lives, things happen uh in terms of we'll get into that a little bit more, but in push and pull where it hurts you actually to have a partner. Okay. And then mentee is the inverse of this. So essentially you uh have a mentee as your business partner. So you are the person who's further ahead. You have them come in and help you execute, right? So you see potential in someone. You see the energy, the loyalty, the growth this person can have and you choose to bring them in in that capacity. So this is all oftentimes finding um underrated or underdeveloped talent that hasn't happened yet. You paved the way and how you already did things in your life or in your industry and they are coming in and producing. Okay. So cons of this a lot of time is the experience they have. This is something where uh let's give a very specific example but um you know like I'm I'm hiring from Martekch. Okay. So I have done all of this now and my kind of options are to hire someone who has experience or have someone who'd come in from X or wherever that would have all the grit, all the energy, all the loyalty, but the experience is going to be lacking a lot of the time and you have to kind of ramp them and work side by side which has massive upside um but also can have some downsides in the short term or you know even overall. So the learning curve, the experience they come in with and then life with them too, right? A lot of time you're dealing with kind of some younger guns or people who are less developed in certain aspects and life can happen a lot of time in there. I say not as much life up here, but it really I mean it's it's everyone, right? You're dealing with people and there's a lot of stuff around this. Um, you know, imagine you're big wig people and there's still stuff that happens in their life. There's still family stuff. There's still stuff like that. So these are the three different levels that I look at it as as just kind of plainly put as someone is either ahead of you in this industry you're partnering with they're either side by side trying to learn in the industry with you or they are new to it and you are the pro right is kind of the dynamic I'm looking at now when it comes to experience this one's super interesting but the ideal stage is complimentary so examples of that and these are very commonly used in like the business in in like the marketplace but visionary and integrator so you have someone who's much more clouds future the fiveyear this is all these amazing things creative and then you have someone who actually operates and like is integrator puts all these actual visions into actionable things has team across there and can actually operate it right very similarly with like a CEO CTO or CEO you know in techland or CEO COO um that's kind of the dynamic right um you'll see a lot of people who are like co-CEOs like I've tried this game um speaking of this like tried this game and actually going back to these real quick so this was more so like a trencher style thing this one was so was this and this kind of but not really. Um, so I don't really view these as this issue as much as I do this next part which is the experience. So expert and operator this is a this is something that you know a lot of people who watch these videos on here are trying to build um you know the offer publisher model like that whole thing where you have an expert and you build a business around them right the info coaching they're the expert and you are the one building it uh or you're the expert and the one building it which is where you're one solo. Okay. So, it's very common now in the marketplace to be an operator for an ex uh expert and you all know anyone out there knows that that needs, you know, different uh skill sets and they both need to be really good at what they do for it to work. So, where this can run into issues is when one person is sprinting and one person is jogging. So someone's setting a vision out there or one p person is pushing for one thing and the other is either sees a different vision or they are just not as efficient of an operator or person as the other. Uh one has way more bandwidth and one doesn't because of something in personal life. Like there's a lot of things that come with partnerships that I don't think get talked about really enough um or thought through when people are doing them because they're just at like such a kind of small stage or infancy of the process. So this is very very common. fingerpointing very very common especially if there's overlap at skill set. So let's say two people are really good at the marketing side and it's not working. It's like either neither person took full champion of a project or a thing or they both kind of did so they both can say that they didn't. Um like there's a lot of this that happens. Um same thing with that can also happen with different right where it's like oh one person runs all operating one does all you know vision whatever and it's like back and forth. This is very common. Um, so you really need to have a lot of the respect and trust uh with one another. And you're not going to know that necessarily off the rip, but you can kind of get a gauge for like how a person is. Um, and then as they are higher up in some of these, you know, in the mentor, they already have a reputation in the space. Um, you can already just tell how they communicate and who they are. So, I think this is a big one. And then life again, um, different people at different stages decide to get married. Different people at different stages have personal things like divorce and death in the family and like just all these things that will happen. And this is your ride or die, right? So this is the person that's in there with you. And until your business gets to a size where you are not the one also doing the roles, which is for a lot of people in this and how until what size. Uh it's really important that you guys have that respect, trust, and like life ties that you know when things get tough, you know, you're there for each other, right? Where are they? This is a really this is another really really big question a lot of people ask here. Um actually, sorry I'm forgetting this, but experience back up to this. So, of this, the partner I had here had much more experience in the private equity space, financial models, like that whole game. And I more so was just like the hungry go-getter, like I'll make anything work type mentality, which left blind spots for me because I didn't see things and I didn't take there was not full transparency, nor did I ask for full transparency around the things like the financials and the books and all that kind of stuff at the time because I wasn't privy to that, right? I was just like, we're partnership and I'm going to handle this part, you handle that part. And we did have the the different you know complimentary skill sets uh where we both had our different thing but the transparency and the trust between that was not really there on mainco this is very very good. So um that's more of this model, right? So for a long time it was really just like tech systems. There was some there's always been strategic or like operational conversations about direction of the company like as a grouping um because there's actually three partners, three core partners, uh two co-founders and I came out as co-owner. Um so I was number like five to it. So as it grew, we all kind of went into our pockets of what we're good at. So one went into you know brand face expert which was at the time fulfillment and brand face for marketing like assets. uh and then over time has just become that marketing piece because we've now out you know built out the division for the fulfillment. uh one was very strong in marketing, sales and all of that piece as well as you know strategy and visionary he stayed there and then I went into tech systems ops um structure all that right so we have complimentary skill sets and that has helped us a ton also in terms of like life and all of that there have been things for across the years that have happened in my life there have been things that happened in their lives where when one kind of is a little foot off the gas like the others can step up and do that until we've you know gotten to a size now where we have people that are you know making sure the systems are running well but when you're in the trenches and you're building, you know, we were essentially this. We were trenching together. We had complimentary skill sets and we had this big shared vision together, right? And that vision has changed. It was initially a cash flow game and then now it's turned more into like this big enterprise value game. Um, so we're building into that, but there has been respect and trust throughout this. There's of course been some fingerpointing kind of, but not really. Um, and then this even not so much. Like we've kind of gotten to a place where we have respect across each other and we have come to the decision of where we're going to take the company together. um because it's necessary for all three, you know, of us to do so. So, that's been a big thing for us. Now, where do you find them? Um right now, if I was to say like where would I find someone is the places you can have conversations and where you can see kind of some who someone is. So, if I was going to say YouTube on here, but that's really like more if you're kind of trying to learn from this like mentor style thing a lot of the time. Not to say that they are actually farther ahead if they're making content, but um X is going to be really good because there's pockets. So, there's like actual communities on there. example, go to the build-in public channel and people like I think it's a channel on X and you can see people that are building things and then ending up partnering together. You can see people doing um day in the life or like building publiclix that are, you know, doing things in lead genen where it's every day. Like you're going to find people who are fantastic at media buying. You're going to find people who are great at bisdev. They're going to come together and they're going to have a paperclick powerhouse because someone's going to do all the selling and get all of the buyers and they're going to have all of the, you know, lead flow from the other guy who's doing all of that. So it's like there's plenty of these dynamics out there where you can find them on X and just network all by just showing what you're doing and what you're interested in, following the right people, communicating on the right things. Communities is another big one. There's Facebook groups like Nothing Held Back on Alen Sultanics, there's tons of partnerships that have come from those. He has paid groups on the back that are even like kind of further down that which we get into. Uh Telegram, there's a bunch of group chats and stuff around there in lead genen space and info coaching space. Um Discord's kind of the same thing. There's e-commerce groups. There's like all these things where you can find people that are all basically trying to build towards something. And if you can find someone that has a complimentary skill set that is in alignment with you and you guys just jam and you're like, you know, you're going to be thick as thieves. Um, another thing I didn't put on here that's big is I've always approached it as business partners and then friends, not friends then business partners. Um, just a personal thing that I have just because I've seen it go so wrong. And of course there's people out there that are family and then business partners and crush it and friends and then business partners and crush it. But for me, I've always just kind of like separated that to where I don't want my friends to then be in business like with me. Um cuz different things come out of different people in different situations when money starts flying around. Um when you know the fingerpointing, the if one person has this vision and the other has this right now you have a shared vision of being friends and like that's amazing in itself. So to just layer in we want to make money together generally in my opinion I like to stay away from it. So side note but paid courses this is the hack of all hacks the bonus all the people I have met that I've ended up partnering with have been through a course in some capacity. Um that's actually completely not true. The successful ones have been the successful ones have been and also friends that I've made through there have all been the best that have come through paid communities. So I join a XYZ course, you know, I bought um one of one of Sam Ovens's early courses. I met someone inside the group. That person ended up being, you know, this company, right? So, and it starts off small and we decided to partner up together and start doing this and this and I actually came in as basically like a contractor employee and then quickly, you know, ramped into coowner. But these are is underrated because what you have here is already you have trenching people that are by your side that are trying to learn a specific thing. you already have a shared vision because you're trying to build said thing. And if you can find someone with complimentary skills and even just like the the accountability to work next to each other is such a life hack. So this is a I would do this if I was anyone. I would find courses free. It could be a free course, right? these community courses where there's people in there that are already there because they're trying to achieve XYZ results and find someone in there that is, you know, also a little vocal and trying to navigate it and one's really good at technical and one's really good at vision or marketing and sales and one's really good at, you know, people, right? Like there's all these different things. You need to make sure that these are complimentary so you're not overlapping on each other too much. But this is a life hack working together. Um, you find this a lot of the time inside companies. We've had, you know, people who have been within our companies and vibe really well and want to go start something and they go do their own thing. Uh that's life and you know it's basically you just become friends through work and then because you're doing work you want to do more work together and just make more money. So this one's pretty common and then cold outreach. This one is interesting. I've heard it work really well but most of the time it's just kind of annoying but that's usually in this kind of dynamic. So you are someone who wants to work for or work with the mentor and you need to provide such immense value and stop asking people for freaking can I chat for 15 or can I pick your brain or any of that stuff. is not helpful. But like you need to come to the table with value for this person and show that you can help execute and that you have this producer energy loyalty growth mentality that you can help push them further. Um and then this also I do want to touch on this because a lot of people ask about this about the expert. So how you match up and do this expert expert operator thing is really generally they may be your mentor kind of but they're really not in the in this industry in this space. A lot of the time they're an expert or a mentor in their niche, let's call it woodworking or whatever, and they're the best of the best here. Like, yeah, you could be their mentee to learn woodworking, but you are going to be trenching side by side if you're about to build an info coaching business around this person. So, you have this mentality where we're in this together building this. You can do cold outreach and have, oh, I've done this before or here, I've seen all these people do it and you need to trust me and let's do this side by side. And this also affects the cap table. So, a lot of the time this is going to be someone who owns more. A lot of time this is going to be someone who owns less. A lot of time this is going to be more your 5050. And as you swing up and down on this, it's not one of these three necessarily. It's just like how far in these directions is where the cap table will go, right? So someone up here is maybe a 6040 or a 9010, right? And then someone down here is, you know, the inverse. So very important to understand that. Um but yeah, cold outreach, paid courses, communities are also going to be big for your expert operator model is finding them where they exist. Um, so if that's a pro in whatever niche, you can find them within these communities, within these Instagram, you know, pockets, all that kind of stuff. So, some cool final questions to ask yourself. Am I excited to share this with this person? You want to win? You're going to win, right? That is the goal. You're going to win. You're going to win with this person. And is that something that even sounds exciting? Are you going to be pissed off when you know you're the operator and you're writing the expert, the check? Like, you don't want that, right? You want to share this with them and share in life and wow we just hit a million in profit this month and send 400 this way and you know 600 this way like you want to feel good about that. Um can this become double the size? This is really for this like trencher mentality and this whole splitting idea is if you can take your e-commerce business you think and again this is all you thinking because you don't know yet is you can take it to 100 grand a month and that's where you want to make or whatever. Cool. if you bring some other guy in and you decide to partner up that you want to trench next to, you need to get to 200 plus and do that in order for you to make the same amount of money. So, you really need to make sure that this is like a 1 plus 1 equals 5, whatever situation versus just more of the same. Um, because that will create an issue. Um, where you just don't make as much money because you didn't believe in yourself or because you tried to shortcut it or whatever. Um, not saying that's wrong because sometimes it's just more fun to do it with someone, but just know that, right? And that's like the same situation we have. If we have to be three times the amount of size for the same profit, let's say if it's, you know, broken into thirds, let's say, um, then you have to make three times the amount of profit in order for each of us to make what we could do solo at one/ird the size, right? So, like that's real and you need to understand that going into it. Um, do they have what I lack? Which goes back to this uh complimentary skill set. It's so nice to have someone that is you don't even have to worry about, right? It's like, oh, I'm so bad at sales. I'm so bad at bisdev, but I can just run the best product and I can do the best conversion rates and I can do all this kind of stuff, but I just suck at talking to people and like this person is all they do. And think about that in like your tech aspect. It's like this person is just building and building and making the best product ever and this person's out here being, you know, face or communications or people, right? Like it's very important that you stack the skills across the board. Um, can we do life together? Getting a little more partnership, real partnership, but like it's real. You're going to spend a lot of the time every single day with this person depending on how you structure your thing uh and your deal. And it's important that you can do life with this person. You can get the wins together. You're going to have L's together. You're going to have random moments where terrible things are going to happen where it's going to be you two, you three, whatever your partnership stack where you guys are together like how do we handle this? And you need to, you know, have that respect and trust and have that life where you are comfortable doing that with the person, which you know, I have and I'm happy I do. Do they raise the bar or slow me down? There are aspects of this that are good. There are a lot that are bad where if you are uh you know a bar raiser as I say at Amazon um but you are constantly trying to take to this next level and you don't have that shared vision or this person is way more cautious in this way and you guys don't align on that. It's good to have that balance. Um but it's not good if it's like too aggressive in either direction. So just kind of understanding that and then would I leave them alone with my company for a month? A lot of people say this is like should would I leave them alone with my kids or like my wife or whatever for a month? Um, but like would you just leave them just simply with your company for a month if you left and they had to do this and you know could they hold everything together without you? And that changes at different levels of the business, but like it just means like do you trust them so much that you think that things would be in the same place or better when you get back? And is this really an ad to the company or is this like a nice to have? So that's my general gist of this. Uh, today is day 81 I believe 82 of making videos every single day. Uh, we just crossed over 75 million in total cash collected, which is great because we were bleeding cash when I started doing these and now we're doing a bit better. Um, but not even close to where we want to go. So, been making these videos every day. www.ryclog.comdoc techmarketing ops, sales, mindset, all the things. You can break them down and filter them by these and check them out. And then, yeah, follow me on uh Instagram uhx. Talk to me there. It's the easiest place for communication. But going to do some more interviews this week. I have three or four lined up with some hitters. So, I'm excited. So I will talk to you guys soon and appreciate
