# Why Your Funnel Isnâ€™t Booking Calls (Live Q&A) | EP108
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYTvFp8Y7zw

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing our weekly weekend Q&A round nine. All these questions here were submitted to the request box over the last week. And today, we're going to answer every single one of them. Looks like we have a ton with context for people who are already running offers that are looking to scale. And then a couple people who are some beginners in here. So, I'm excited for this one. I think it's going to have a lot of golden nuggets. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 77 million actually in total cash collected. I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, we're going to kick this off again. Sorry for the audio. I'm on a bachelor party and it is early and I'm trying to knock this out so we can go have a boat day. All right, so starting on the first one, I'm in the dating niche for a specific niche of men. Any advice on how to get more leads via reals, copying viral videos? Um, via reals. So, no. I mean, I'm not we don't do a lot of organics. So, I'm not going to have any like specifics for you. But this is the same as if it's a specific niche of whatever. If you're trying to find architects, if you're trying to find women 40 to 60, if you're trying to find whatever you have to go where they hang out, you have to target them specific. So, in organic, you it's all about what you're saying in your messaging, right? So, it's all about the creative. It's all about what type of content you're putting out there that resonates with this specific niche of men. Um, and then, yeah, getting building an audience, and then having proper call to actions, having good enough offers that people want to. Um, so yeah, I mean copying viral videos. I'm a huge fan of modeling. So I love if I can find something that already works somewhere in XYZ niche or even in my own niche and then being able to, you know, replicate it with our own spin on it is very important too. Um, so yeah. So I mean I think that one's pretty direct, but um, Horosi has a good book leads. Like there's different there's a lot of different sources. There's organic, so you're just saying IG reels here, but there's 92 different ways you can get traffic. Like who else has customers that are specific niche of men? Can you do a partnership with them? um do some ail like an affiliate deal with them where you pay them $100 cost per acquisition or I don't know your units or whatever, but like say you have a 5k program. Can you pay them $1,000 for everybody they refer over that purchases? Like then you never have to run an ad, never make or like organic and like you want to have multiple sources of acquisition. So you do want to do your own stuff, but there's a lot of different ways other than like how do I make Instagram reels is kind of what I'm thinking. So how to work 8 to 12 hours a day locked in? I just get myself to work that long. The brain energy goes to me. Um, yeah, there's a lot of guys that talk really uh good about this. Mark Scales Brands talks on some of this. Becker has content on this. Um, a bunch of others have content on this, but in my opinion, what it's going to come down to, I mean, you could drink, this is not advice, by the way. This is not find whatever doctor advice or whatever you're supposed to say, but like dude, you could drink 12 monsters a day, sleep like two hours a day, and as long as you're working on something that you like actually enjoy or that you're like challenging you or that you like get energy from, you're fine. And like you can only do that for a season, but like there's all the classic stuff. It's like drinking off water. It's sleep. It's like, you know, no tech after x amount of time. It's take XYZ supplement. It's like eat what is good for your body. Some people thrive on vegan. Some people thrive on carnivore. Some people like all that kind of stuff. Move your like all the classics. But there's like, you know, mind, body, soul type things that are like the 8020 that you can do where it's like, you know, I have nicotine and caffeine right now. And you know, is that the best cleanest source of energy? Absolutely not. But like, am I fine? Yes. Did I sleep like three hours? Yes. Like all good. So like I enjoy this. So, I'm going to continue to do this. Um, my biggest thing with the 8 to 12 hours locked in is like what are you working on for 8 to 12 hours a day that's like needle moving because the bigger thing is like setting yourself up so you're working on high impact like lever pulls so you're doing things that are actually moving the business, actually moving your life, actually moving towards whatever goal or set or something like that. Um, I think that's the biggest thing is like doing something that you actually enjoy and doing things that have a feedback loop so that you get the energy back because you did XYZ it got XYZ result feeds the flywheel and you keep leaning that direction and then over time I mean again 8 to 12 hours a day locked in like as you start to scale up it gets more and more it gets much more difficult to find things to work on for 8 to 12 hours a day all day every day like I'm the classic I work 16 hours a day it's like I'm scattered as all heck right now and I'm like trying to get to a point where I have like only the top levers where I have leverage through team where I have leverage through tech where I have leverage compared to these other pieces. Um, or I'm in just the right vehicle that the hour, the dollar per hour comes out much higher. So, that's kind of my thought on it. Hopefully, that was helpful. But, paper call, how to get people who act to actually call. Example creative. The lander is usually the same, but how to get them to actually take action, not just bounce before after the click. Um, go and find Carlos. Carlos has I think I don't know if it's free or if it's like very affordable. Um, but he has tons of trainings on this. He has landers. He has offer things that are built into like his white label GHL that you can use that like already work, but most people, there's so many different ways to do this, but like most people do like a quizander. So, they'll ask a bunch of XYZ questions. They get to the end and it's like, "Hey, you qualify. Click here to call." Um, is like a very common one. Um, some people just do like a two-pager on ClickFunnels or whatever that's like, you know, apply for whatever stimulus thing, check, whatever. I'm thinking like ACA right now. Um, or like get, you know, $6,500, whatever they use. And then it's like click here to see uh click here to apply or click here to qualify. They click and then it's like you've qualified and then it's just literally a phone number. Like I know people who run simple two pages. So, but it is the uh um by media um on X talks about this as well on his stuff. But it's all about like the the continuity, the congruency throughout where you're at with the ad to the lander to the page that actually has a call to action. So, I don't know again if that helps, but like there's guys out there that do all they do is make content about this. So like I would go consume that. How do you phrase a sales call for coaching with the low ticket funnel? So for low ticket I think what you're referring to is we have an ascension funnel. So essentially someone's buying something that's low ticket that is an info piece that is like this big um that solves a like a problem but also just kind of introduces that this is only step one and then there's all these other things and personalization onetoone and all that. So we will take um I think that's what you're referring to. So on that on the tail end of that one second. Oh I'm going to kill these guys. There's like 12 phones in here all ring. Um, so for the ascension portion of it, so they'll buy a low ticket and then on the thank you page, it'll say here, click here to book your quick uh quick start guide or your I'm sorry, a quick start call, your onboarding call, your implementation call. And that is with a setter. And then the setter will have a conversation with them. It's like, hey, did you get your access to your things? They're 15-minute bookings. Uh, we actually use Zoom on ours. A lot of people just do it on phone number. Um, both work depending on your demo and uh kind of the the warmth of them in there. Um, so you will then uh position that call to be like, did you get access to your things? Okay, cool. And like why did you not apply for XYZ? Like why didn't you apply for whatever the big coaching program is or did you see on the site like all those testimonials? Like just FYI, like all those testimonials came from our actual top uh coaching program and then you position them over, you know, would you be interested in this? You qualify them. Do they have, you know, even the funds, the interest, the whatever? Are they the actual ICP? Like do they fit in that? And if you do good enough selling the low ticket that it's in alignment with the back end, then it usually like flows pretty well. So that's how we do ours. And those calls that come from the, you know, quick start call over to the uh closer call have the highest show rates and the highest close rate of anything else in the company. So the economics like crush. So hopefully that's what you meant. In your last video, we talked about backend offers that blast your LTV. I assume you mean up. Um how do how would you go about the process of starting a mastermind? Like what would be the first steps? Would you find someone already doing it? Get feedback from your existing clients and how and how little is too little when it comes to the day activities? How little is too little when it comes to the day's activities and how much is is going to go too in-depth? I don't really understand the back portion, but I made a video yesterday about this. So, essentially that the thing with masterminds is like it needs to be a lot of the time it's about who's in the room. So, it's like kind of garnered from like who's in there. So, it's both the community aspect and then also some education portion, some learnings that are different that are at a higher level. So like implementation kind of like it you hit kind of peak implementation level and now you have these people who are generally speaking I mean you can do it in any niche but it has to be your customers all have to be very they have to have some something that ties them together. They have to have golden thread. They have to have something that makes sense for why why they would ascend or stay in this bucket. Um so like a great example of this like Russell Brunson's. Um there used to be one that was really big uh that was in the info coaching space um that would go up and everyone was basically the category king. I literally made a video on this yesterday, but like for us, for example, it doesn't work because where are they going to send to? They're not all similar enough in the ICP. It's like what are you going to educate on or whatever. Like an event for us would work, but like a mastermind where someone pays 50 grand a year or 30 grand a year or 100 grand a year. Like I've heard crazy ones that go even higher. Um to have that you need people who are all similar so that they can like vibe together. They want to have to like pay to play. And then a lot of the time also it's like expertled. So, it's like they want the closer proximity and that's the closest proximity you can get to like the head hunt, the like the expert, the brand face, the person. So, that's like the most common way. Um, but usually again, you're going to send these people out of like a current offering. So, it's kind of like the back is literally the back end of the thing. So, you already need some front end or some, you know, high ticket someone in that realm. You need a lot of customers over there so that 10% of them ascend. And you know, again, there's different stats and all this kind of stuff, but like usually you want a bucket of people that are already in there that are like the highest level consumption because you're not going to run an ad or just drop something on organic generally speaking. You may be on organic. Um, but you are then going to, you know, have some 30k offering and you're going to have 15 people for it to even be a mastermind because you need people for it to be generally. So, hey Ryan, quick question on the call flow constraint. I'm selling a high ticket fitness for men over 40 using YouTube organic light retargeting. I'm averaging 500 to 700 unique visitors to my VSSL funnel per week and over 100,000 long torn. Nice, but I'm only booking one to five calls per week from this funnel. I know I'm getting the right demographic based on my YouTube analytics, but so I don't think the traffic's issue. Do you think this purely VSSL copy problem or could it point to deeper more fundamental issues of my funal or my content strategy? If you were in my shoes and saw this kind of cash call flow constraint, uh what would you look to first? Um so again, we don't have anything organic. I the thing with organic is like you have all of these pros. You have like this m you have this big audience. You have the consumption. You have the warmth. They're like layups by the time they get on the phone a lot of the time. Like you have all these different pieces that are really good. Um but you don't have sometimes you can have depending on your like content schedule and like the size and whatever consistency in how many people are booking a day that you would have with paid. So we do everything with paid. Um we are doing stuff with organic. We have this massive content engine that exists for mo uh uh middle and bottom of funnel. Now, just now we are starting to attempt to do some that are like outlier specific where we're just targeting all that for organic for long form on YouTube. Um, but yeah, the the consistency around that's an issue. So, 500 to 700 unique visitors to my VSSL funnel. Also, what kind of VSSL funnel are you running? Because if are you running a DTA, which works really well on organic if it's framed correctly. So, if you have essentially a headline that calls out the audience as whatever XYZ offer, you have VSSL on page and application button. Um, nothing's gated, no opt-in, no whatever. You're already getting the consumption from YouTube. Ideally, they're, you know, ideally not just like watching that one video, trying to apply and then like that's it. Like ideally, they've watched uh, you know, some of your content. Um, but if you just do that funnel, five calls for 700 is not good. Uh, five or whatever, five calls. Yeah. For 500 unique visitors is not that good. Um, right. Wait, let me do the math on this. Sorry. So 500 five on 500. Yeah, it's a 1%. That's what I thought. I'm terrible with zeros on the mental math. Um so yeah, 1% is not good. Like a lot of people get anywhere from five to 20. Like I think uh Jeremy on his said it was a 30% uh on a click to app. So like a page view to app on theirs on that type of funnel. So yeah, uh I would look at the VSSL, I would look at the headline. I mean like ideally if you're track I mean you're going to know better than if your organic is good enough and what it is framing and priming like framing and priming them for but you need the you need the continuity across right so like yes you can do this to get all the views but then when you do all your call to actions and all your places and spaces you get 500 to 700 people to click over to the page if then it's only through there I don't know the exact frame but like if you're getting like five applications and then five bookings through there like it's clearly of something that's on page so it's the offer it's the headline it's the VSSL it's in there. It's your application sucks. You have a tech problem. Like it can be literally anything. Um so I can't, you know, directly say on here. Um you can look at your VSSL stats like what are good VSSL stats. DTA funnels have way lower consumption because they're not gated. So there's no need for someone to like watch a lot of it um in order to just apply like they can just click the apply button. So a lot of common ones are headline, VSSL, application button, and like testimonial wall. Um, some do it without the testimonial wall, but yeah, it's something that happens on that page, assuming that the framing that they're coming into this for makes sense. So, if you're like, "Oh, get this free training versus like apply for my program." Like, very different intent when someone clicks on that. And you just have to make sure that that's all in alignment. So, you can DM me and we can go through this a little bit more, but just resubmitting both questions so I remain on the top of results. Thanks, G. I'm a 21 I'm a 20 year old sales setter in the info space with 13 months experience. Last month I brought in 250 cash as a setter. Previous was 150. Okay, so you're growing. Cool. Oh, nice. Upwards of 16K a month. That's pretty solid for That's very solid for a setter. Uh eventually move into closing 30K based on closer, but I'm thinking longterm update. I got promoted to a front-end closer. Short-term goal is stacking cash through sales. Long-term is building this. Would you would prefer learning under someone rather than starting my own thing? My question for someone with sales foundation who wants to transition into ops or marketing within info. What specific action should I take to my position myself in those roles? What skills should I prioritize learning? How do I demonstrate my value just beyond that? Yeah. So, I mean, literally talk to your person about that. I mean, a lot of times they're going to be like just close. Like be a sicko closer because as somebody who owns this or one of these and has sales team like I want my sales team to be closing. I want a closer to be closing. I want a setter to be setting. Um, but depending on your dynamic and your relationship within the company and all that, there are ways to learn internal. ways to just like, you know, network for no for a lack of a better word, but like with the people who are running those positions and pieces. Um, you also can continue to build up like the skill stack and the network within the space. Go in the places that the info coaching people hang out in. Go in the nothing held back groups. Go and talk to other people who are in sales uh who are other sales reps. Go and talk to um, you know, I I don't know why maybe you would be interested in doing sales management and like trying to scale that tier because as you have access to like more people essentially, you can get you can learn through proximity already directly. Um, but then the only other way is either get a job in one that's like market or uh what do you say? Ops. Marketing and ops. You're already going to get closer to marketing, especially if you start to go higher in like clo uh in sales. So, if you get into like sales management, for example, like you already are bouncing back and forth with the marketing team a lot. You can consume a ton of content around the marketing piece. Like it's literally endless uh on our little corner of the internet where you can learn how to do the marketing portion. But you either either need to like learn through proximity in your role slash like be paid to do it as like a job. Uh and whether that's in your current company or get a job doing it in another company, but like have some skills or like have a relationship with someone where they'll trust you or you know bet on you. And then the other is to just start your own thing. But starting your own thing is a lot is just a lot different. Um and I don't know what what you're up to. Number two on here, the company I'm working to working at is a B2C bisop offer in the info space. We changed sales process 6 months ago. So now it's ad evergreen webinar 2K front art and 78 sales cycle. The shorten 140 days to 10ish days rorowass much higher. Don't have the exact numbers on the front end. Still not break even. Company was okay with that because we're focusing on back end. Yeah, it's perfect. Month and have it been efficiency this month. Reached a teamwide 70% ascension rate. Yep. Solid. It's amazing. Gotten to a point where it's very efficient. So focusing on the front end everything paid media. If the goal is to maximize profitability and not increase ad spend, is it worth even trying to break even on the front end as opposed to increasing backend efficiency if something becomes break even or even profitable in the front end is possible? How would you go about doing it and need more context? I'm happy to find um no it makes sense. So like that model is like tried and true and just and crushes. So um the one 2Ks and then all focusing on LTV like yeah there are other levers to pull. There are potentially other funnel like models or structures. Um, but when you're collecting one 2K cash on a direct to cart, whether that's a VSSL, whether that's webinar, whether that's um I mean those are kind of the core too, but like whether you're doing that or like I know a lot of people for example that then like roll into outbound at that point. So it's like they have outbound because the economy the the economics makes sense to do it for that seven would you say 78k offer they'll do there. I know other people like because what you can either work on like the acquisition source, the acquisition model, but like the acquisition model of what you're doing now is the webinar is that one flow. You can get the economics cheaper to where you get a same quality but lower cost per lead for the webinar. You can get higher show rates for the webinar by optimizing. You can get higher close rates by split testing the actual webinar over and over and over again to squeeze another five, 10, whatever percent out of it. you I mean you can optimize the out of a funnel but the other thing and the thing that we like messed up on I think was that we did you know 71 million through one funnel just hammered it and then when it started to break we had nothing else like warming up we had no other messaging funnels whether the same funnel types or completely different like like a low ticket for example or a direct toart or I'm sorry a uh direct application so we didn't have other funnel types let alone having more of the same funnel types like another webinar that targeted whatever messaging that was like a different pocket of people or just even different messaging to the same people because some will resonate with something that's like you know make money from your laptop and do this and the other is uh you know how to be XYZ you know family man and and work from home you know there's just different models that you can say the messaging that aligns with it um so I would focus on that is having if you guys know this funnel type so well because as soon as you start changing things like uh DTA for example like there's no setter call it's straight to closer usually it could be a two call but it's just like a different flow so if you already have everything built around that flow of like the 2K they consume this you have I don't know if you said it in here but a lot of people I mean 70% ascension rate is insane so like that's super solid so I would focus on that and then I would also move into the other kind of like pieces and buckets of that um of trying to hedge on the actual marketing piece because you one you just want the hedge just in general but then two if it gets to a point where that funnel doesn't work you need something else set up or literally you go to zero or very very low because it's all just an LTV game at that point and that's the other thing is like, you know, uh you win if you can pay the most to acquire a customer. It's also like not a big deal, uh if you're not. And then all of a sudden there's something that's after the 7.8K that makes it so the efficiency is even more so. So you can pull all these levers like also at the same time to where instead now your LTV doesn't max out at the 7.8K, you have two, three backends, you have another level of ascension that's 30% to like we were talking about earlier, uh mastermind or software plays or whatever that you can make more person per customer. So the acquisition isn't like as constrained. You don't have to be on the hamster wheel of acquisition. And the other thing that I think is very important is to actually hedge on the front end because you just never know. Sometimes like the funnel can die for whatever reason. Sometimes they can be non-compliant. Sometimes you can have like these other issues that can arise uh where it is nice to have a low ticket as well. It is nice to have like a challenge cadence that you do every quarter. It is nice to have another direct to app and people will hit multiple of these too. It's like someone goes on the webinar but they don't buy but then they see this other one they apply direct. They already have some consumption from over here. So your cost, you know, your your blended cost through uh works out really well if you do that. So I would focus on that. If you were a closer right now looking to take the next step and start your own business, would you start your own offer info teaching sales or sales agency? Something completely different. Um I don't I don't know. I don't really prescribe to this like necessarily. So u I would probably do more so sales agency like sell it as a service because I think that has more legs. I think that's also like where the industry is going. I made a video on this. I think everyone should have a sales agency if you are info coaching focusing on cash flow and like just it just becomes the biggest headache in the business because of the headcount uh usually and like the consistency over there. So, in my opinion, I think that most people should use a sales agency. Not all and especially not if you just need a couple people, but like once it gets to the point where you have a manager that you have to manage or you before you have a manager, you're managing a bunch of closers and setters and efficiency. Like you're just missing out on potential like efficiencies or like upside. Uh if you are self-managing and you're not like, you know, really on it, like really on the ball, there's like this cost game like all the time at 20%. So, it's like if you can get, you know, all your closers are 10%. and you can like play this math game where it is actually more beneficial to be internal. But side rant. Um but yeah, I would probably do I mean everyone has a sales agency. You just have to stand out as good. Uh if you have the network, the relationship and you get three, four, five of those and they're doing you know 100k a month. You have a 20% you know fee and it's costing you 10 or 12 or whatever to fulfill on it. I don't really know the exact math of that. Let's call 5%. So you're making five grand in profit per and you have five of them. You're making 25 GS a month. Like maybe that's the play. But then you have multiple clients, you have multiple bosses, you have that whole game. Um, is there info, a lot of people do this game. So there's a lot of people doing like info sales on there. Um, or who teach info about how to get into sales and there's guys who crush. So like it's a competitive market, no doubt. But like if you can find your pocket like for example like Shelby sells like I think that's her I don't remember her name but or her her offer setup but um she found the pocket of teaching women directly how to do this. Um, and she's crushing. She's absolutely crushing. So, there's like a hundred dudes doing this and there's like her and then like I think like one or two other girls that I've seen at least on social that are doing this, but she's just like dominating because she found a pocket and did it. So, like you could do the same thing, not saying like gender, but saying like some other niche that like teaches people how to do uh there's other guys who do it um like how to do Medicare sales for example or how to do um you know uh whole life sales or like these other things as well. Not just like how to be a remote closer because that's kind of like been hammered through. But that's what I think. Uh, how to position demand capture offers. Selling insurance, employee benefits, cyber security. Uh, same as any other funnel. I think I don't really know. Position demand capture offers. Yeah, I mean I think it's just the same as any other offer. So, I'm not the full-on marketing guy. More so like the structure and math and whatever. Um, I mean, I get it, but selling insurance and employee benefits. Yeah, you have a good offer and you get people that are interested in the offer to it. So that is your advertising side or your lead flow side which again can be part which gives a 92 different things but that can be partnerships like I know a guy who has like um you know LLC's and whatever formation and tax structure thing and they do no ads they do no organic and all they do is have partnerships on the back end of some of these programs that do real estate or uh people who are starting a business for the first time and need LLC or uh people who do foreign um are trying to do like the tax game international and like they need different entities and stuff like Okay. And they only just do it through um partnerships. So they just found a bunch of people. They give them whatever riff, 10% or 50% or whatever um or a CPA number. So it's a,000 bucks to acquire a customer. And instead of having to run ads and pay what could be $500 cost per acquisition or $2,000 acquisition, they just lock it in a,000. They just do it through partnerships. So like businesses like this work well for that, like insurance and employee benefits. Like who do you partner with that has a constant inflow of people who need insurance and employee benefits or cyber security or whatever. Um, also a lot of these industries work well for depending on how hot ticket it is for outbound. So, cold outreach and sniping of that, but that all comes down to have a prop having proper positioning, having a good enough offer that makes sense, all that kind of stuff. So, hope that was helpful. I don't really understand that one, but you grow a business by solving bottlenecks. My bottleneck is just increasing ad spend. I'm already doing 4 to 5x. If today I launched new ads, I have at least a few days before I see an increase in ad spend worked. What do I do in the meantime? And even after the increase worked, it still it still won't take me all day. It's just a few hours a week in the meantime to overcome potential bottleneck number two like increase conversions. We're two co-founders. We spend 10 plus 10 hours per day. How do we spend the 20 hours a day we have? Do we take more projects to increase LTV improve? All right, I think I get what you're saying. Um, so yeah. Uh, so like for us for example, like if we increase spend today, like we need to do it for because what we're always optimizing for like kind of I mean true true is like how many units and calls per sale, but uh like the more immediate is how many calls are on day because for us sales team availability is like the the bottleneck. So it's like if we have 300 open spots today like we're doing ourselves a disservice if we have anything under 280 bookings on day right or whatever number. Um so for us it's like solving for that and then you know as bottleneck number one you could say the next is like just down the chain. So it's like okay that happens now you increase your spend your maps math is mathing and now it's like what lever it's like can we get those calls for a more affordable cost. Like there is one core thing that's broken and like right now for example like ours is going to be more so about sales because it's like whether that's volume of sales calls so like hiring more team and like doing that portion of it or is it the actual close rates and the efficiency of the overall sales team like are they at a sales per booking percentage which is a function of um show rate and uh close rate but are there levers we can pull inside there to get that more efficient because we need to solve for that before we increase the team because the math isn't mathing right is like there now the next piece is like okay cool now that's working now fulfillment is going is either going to break or is already breaking because there's so much inflow. So then you're solving over here and like I get what you're saying like you the biggest thing is like if you try and go and like oh I'm going to go do this other thing or like work on stuff just to like work on stuff like you need to be able to identify what I talked about earlier is like what the higher level things are. So like yes, if you can solve for things like increase LTV, that is going to say that is going to help you tfold in the future when you're no longer on a hamster wheel of having to acquire customers either in the bad times or the good times because you have a 10 to one on the back that you know it converts at 20% and then you fine-tune it and it converts at 35% now and you can focus on that. So like it's it's playing all these games, mapping all of this out and being like what is the current constraint and bottleneck solving for it and then yes understanding that okay so I I I just don't think that your current constraint necessarily is like spending more on ads and if it is like spend way more on ads then like lean into that like until something else either breaks or that continues to be it and you're constantly solving it constantly solving it. Um but I think that answers that. And then with partners, the big thing is like having it's fun to be like in the trenches together and like building stuff side by side, but it's also good to have people of like complimentary skill sets. So like one person's really good over here and one's over here so you guys can both like do that versus two people working on the same thing. Um it's always fun to like brainstorm and like come up with stuff. But if you want like if you're looking at you both as like how do I spend my hours or like where's my efficiency? That is in the conversations that is in the actions you guys are both actually individually taking. Um, and making sure that there is, you know, differentiation like or or when you guys do work together, it's, you know, a 5x, not a 2x because if it's a 2x, like, you know, it's not it's not that fancy. So, I think that answers your question. Um, this whole like then you're focusing on 10 different things. Yeah, I mean, you need to track all the metrics across, but like focus on solving one until it's solved, unless something's on fire and breaking and then that's your bottleneck. So, like list them all out, but like you know, is my cost per acquisition $100 and I want it at 70? It's like and it doesn't, you know, that's the biggest lever. Solve for that. You're solving for that. You're solving for that. Something lights on fire over here. You go fix it because that is truly now like the fire needs to be put out. And then you solve for that. And then you come back to this until you get this one right. And then all of a sudden now you have your $7 CPA, but your LTD is $200. And you're like, "Okay, cool. How do I get that to $2,000?" And it's like, is there partnership availabilities? Are there offers that we can create? Now all of a sudden I have to do the whole offer creation or how we can fulfill on it. And it's like these different projects go in these es and flows. And then as you get team too it's like prioritizing the projects which is the next question on here but like prioritizing the projects in what order so that you are doing things for the business that I mean generally speaking usually around cash flow but like or future cash flow targets. Um so you want to focus on the things that are actually going to move the needle. So project management um on this we've actually have not done a fantastic job of this. So we've had different project managers that are in house that we've tried and it's just been like they slow us down or like they just like want to create a hundred item checklist for something that's so simple and like a clickup board. Um, we've moved. We were at Air Table, which honestly was my favorite. And then we went to I don't know what's next, but then we ended up on ClickUp. We had so much stuff in ClickUp. I'm like, "All right, cool. I can just rock with this." So, when I started to lean in and take over more ops, I basically built out using like an EOS structure, an ids list that is your classic like um what's in the parking lot or open, what is in to-do, once it moves from to-do, we assign it to someone and it gets a due date and then it moves into in progress and done. And then inside there, they'll use the subtask to do that. Um I am already finding with like the team size and all that stuff like I don't want to be the person who is like building the boards or doing that kind of stuff and they are not necessarily good enough at it. Like we have very creative for example over on marketing like they're not great at doing the systems portion and like the due dates and the breaking them down SOPs. So I actually have an interview with someone on Monday for project management which is like a light level mid-level ops. Um we don't need like a full-on operator. Um, but we do need someone who can kind of come in and like make sure the lists are up to date, follow up with the right people, get something that, oh, it needs to be due by this because this then allows this next person to work on the next piece. Uh, oh, we need graphics for this thing. Okay, but or we need this presentation deck. And it's like this person builds it, but they need the assets. Or a great example is like uh when we do a funnel build, it's like someone can build the page, someone can put the copy on, but it's like you need the copyrighter to do the copy. You need someone a graphic designer or whatever to do like the the assets on page. You need to make sure the offer is done in the product land. You need to make sure that these different pieces and different ones require like you can't finish the page until the assets are done. Copy can maybe be the first thing in, but it's like still not live. Then you need marketing tech to come in and make sure that everything is good and that all the tech is enabled and that it pushes into the CRM. So like it comes in these like flows. So right now we use ClickUp and it actually works well. like we're still pumping stuff out, but like I want someone in there who's like managing this and who has like reporting on this and it's like where are people at? Where where's teams efficiencies? Um you know so and so was responsible for this project and it's falling on its face three times and it's like okay that person either needs to be off the team or not in charge of projects because they need to stay in there just be a copywriter or whatever. So that's our example. Uh what does messaging and funnel look like for disqualified leads? Do you send them to a low ticket offer? Yes, kind of. Um do you have a page that says something like we'll reach out but you never actually follow up? Kind of. So for us, and not this is not necessarily like the right way to do it, but like we just threw this together because we were getting too many bookings. So we need to So we split them into DQ and qualified. For us, there's one financial qualifier on there that's like basically very apparent like they're they're basically never going to close. So we push them to a DQ booking uh until we're almost at capacity, until we have like 20% left on capacity. And then we only allow in the quality bookings. And the DQ bookings e no longer can book, but they'll go to a page that's like, hey, we still need some more information based on your application. So and so is going to reach out, which is an AI bot that does text them. and then it pushes them. It's like or you know click here you also qualify for this whatever XYZ low ticket and they'll go there and that'll pick up a couple sales. Um and then we believe that if someone messages and goes back and forth and has all this context like based on the stats that person has more intent and more interest and whatever and even if they haven't didn't hit XYZ financial qualifier. Ours is kind of soft too because it's like how much have you invested in yourself in the past not like how much cash do you have? So like they could still afford it and like we've run lead on it and there are people in that pocket who can afford it. So if they have the intent high enough like they can still find their way to book and that's how we've done in the past. So um can you give an update on sending with iMessage versus Android? Are you still using iMessage? Have you seen an increase in response rate? Is it working? Do you have a specific platform you recommend? Um yeah. So I like blue send. It's kind of expensive. Tell Sam Queen. Hit him up and tell him I sent you because I want more lines and I think he might give me a riff but thus far they give me zero dollars so FYI. Um but send's been good. I think they're kind of like the pioneer of a lot of these. There are other ones like link. There are other I don't remember the other names, but link is another one that plugs into GHL. So for us, we right now are basically talking about moving every single closer over there so all the closers can have blue lines. Um because I think that'll be a big lift in show rate and um like conversation rate with them, which is like the thing I'm optimizing for. So if we can hit that, then we're good. Um but right now we only use it still for that same thing I made in the video, which is for uh so basically no one logs in the platform, no one uses it, it's just API calls. So, we just use it for the AI bot that has uh uh communication with people who are app no bookings, but that volume has vastly decreased since we've increased the setter team because they dial them and they turn her off, the her the AI bot off. Um, so we've focused on that for us thus far. Um, so yeah, but I do think we're going to move them over and I also think we're going to move the setters over to like a mass dialing thing. So, we'll have setters that are in this mass dialer thing, which I think doesn't have SMS, which is like a whole another show. And then we have the main dialing. Right now, we use Alaware and that's for everyone. We have every everybody CS closers and setters on there. And then we're going to put probably the closers just on blue because I think that's the higher highest lever point and the volume wouldn't work for setters. So we can't do it because it's only 50 contacts per day per line that you can use on blue on any of these platforms right now. Appreciate all the content. Nothing else like it at the moment. Please don't add edits. I won't. I have a client who has a bizapp offer teaching how to flip cars on the side. Full-time jobs, make an extra 1050. I have a 25% rev share, $1,500 offer. Uh they have a free community and 5K members trying to focus on building out a paid channel. What would be your approach? Um current setup is add this book a call and the current yeah $25 calls is great. So I wouldn't change anything. I mean assuming the quality is there but I don't know you DM me on this or ask another question on here because yeah I mean it sounds like a great opportunity for you and it sounds good but I don't know what's bottle what is the bottleneck of this and where things are breaking. Um because $25 calls are great unless they're like terrible quality or they never show or whatever and you're doing like all this massive volume and you have to have 15 closers and you're still only like squeezing out like this much like so yeah I would uh I I need more information on this but if you're getting qualified calls for $25 that'sing amazing and that crushes especially if you get you know stats are the true true is like 70% show rates and like 30 30 plus% live call close rates are like dialed um and then you know ours are lower than that on both those FYI but um that cost per call is crazy low for a you know $1,500 $100 offer. $1,500 offer. You can sell that direct. So, there's another game where you are just trying to sell this direct or you have this in pay plans or you have even lower ticket than this and then there's an ascension game. Um because 1,500 is kind of like that weird price point where it's like it's a lower purchase. So, like you need a webinar maybe for like a direct toart or like a long form VSSL or you need to increase this price and do it over the phone still because 1,500 is cheap. We sold it info for $1,500 for a long time over the phone. not for a long time, but years ago when the cost made sense and we were getting like, you know, sub $100 calls and selling a $1,1500 product that had like a very high cash collection rate on payment plans. Um, and that crushed for us, but it was just info. So, there was like no fulfillment, which looks like yours course and group coaching. It's very very uh affordable at volume like per unit to do. So, yeah, send me more info on this, but you I just need to know like this could work, but again, that is pretty low. I think you could actually sell it for higher and make more of a spread. Uh, how do you deal with feeling uninspired? I sat down at my desk every day with no idea what to work on, no idea what to work towards. I'm already making money that I know what to do with to be honest. More money than I know what to do with and I hit a lot of my goals. Yeah, dude. You just got to find something that's like exciting to you. Like, I've talked about this a couple times on this call on this call on this uh video, but it's like what do you enjoy doing? Like maybe you are one of the people who's like, "Cool, I make 100 grand a month and like I'm chilling and like that's so like all good." Like I don't know. I don't even look at money really like that anymore. like it's more so like the game of it and the progression that piece and like what actually excites you. So if you're not in inspired on that piece like at some point it's like who cares like get it to the point where you don't have to you know work on it eight hours a day if you're uninspired by it. So like you know fix it in that way but I think that's kind of the core piece like work on something you actually care about. Um and then also just like it doesn't even have to necessarily be work like people have plenty of like work life balance to do this. I'm just not one of them. Uh email deliverability issues. is we get about thousand leads per day uh from paid traffic and consistently have email deliverability issues. Too high spam rate scores for the past three years. We have so many email subscribers but I can't contact them. We don't spend spam. We only send one email per week at most. Yes, people just don't want to hear from you. So typical email open rates are 20 30% plus click rates 1 to 3% uh for the automated sequences that are all contextual. And then same thing the broadcasts are even higher and those are twice a day every day. So list size active 100k plus. Let's just say we have 1 point something in total CRM on there. Uh how do you know your average spam rate on Google? Yeah, I have like Z like like basically zero. So we have very low um I can pull it up and like if you want to DM me, I can give you the exact number. Um but it's extremely low. So we've done a very good job of this. Everything is contextual. People opt in only for XYZ. We only send them XYZ. um because these people don't want to hear from you if you're getting spam uh rates uh or like they're opting in for whatever through a brand and you're sending it from something else that doesn't make sense. Like there's some something is going on here. You have something broken um because you should get there. Now, it is true that like leads stop opening and clicking and they fall off the list. So, you only send to the hot pocket. So, it's you know 90day click, 30-day open for example is like a very common one. Um and some stuff like that. Um but yeah, just send me that. as somebody who probably leaves uh cold receives a lot of cold outreach. What is an offer, lead magnet or even copy itself that stands out to you? What would they need to say or offer? Not immediately market as spam, be open to engaging. Yeah, just something that's a good offer. So, it's literally this. It's like what is a crazy good offer and that is completely contextual and dependent on the person and the time. So, like I get a lot that are like I've answered a couple that were around like how people were going to do AI automations because I talked about that specific like that was something I'm looking for. People reached out and said they'll do all my automations or whatever. So, like I've I've entertained some conversations over there. Um, but again, it's just like what's important now or like what what fits in there now. Um, I got to zip through these. Everyone is literally leaving right now, so I have to go. Um, I ran an agency for years and shut it down to co coaching. I actually might come back to these cuz these guys are all like popping out here. But as someone who probably receives a lot of co Oh, I'm sorry. I've ran an agency for years and recently shut it down to switch to coaching. I'm going to keep my avatar the same and want to scale to scale with meta ads. I'm going to still have some done for you elements which would include a full funnel and VSSL script and the rest will be online courses. I'm going to start running ads off the bat and then focus on YouTube long form for that position from your POV. Anything I should consider here? Anything you do different? No, I mean that totally makes sense to me. Like coaches do like that is a good pocket. Um AK price point like yeah, you just got to test like I mean I I agree with the idea. Um this is how a lot of people work in it. So yeah, you just got to get it going. See your stats in the beginning. Make sure you track everything and then you understand like where everything's at because you're doing this on a phone call like I think right scale with meta via cell phone. Yeah. 8K offer. You're likely doing it over the phone. So you'll gather a lot of feedback on how you can change marketing and scale into it. So I'm a sales rep at this company offer space. Okay. This is the same one I already answered. Same one I already answered. Oh, we're doing all these. Yeah, let's go. We got time. Uh how do you set goals to stay motivated business? Not get caught up in the revenue hamster wheel. I'm making 120K 120 to 150K per month and have surpassed my original goal. I felt stuck for the past year on what I should be reaching now. Yeah, it's just like what do you want to do? So, there's a lot of questions about this which is very interesting. But yeah, like mine has always just come now down to the goal of progression on this. So, it's like skill set and stacking and uh how do you turn that to 200 and not just for the sake of turning it to 200, but like maybe you as a person need to change XYZ in order to do that or you need to develop the skill set of being able to have a team infrastructure and only work two hours a week because you have a team that fully runs it. Like there's just different levels to this and always like how much time do you spend in it? uh what is your skills to stack in whatever how do you develop AI so you only have two employees instead of a 10 like there's always different levers and games to play and then it's like a much broader question of like what do you actually want maybe that's fine and now you just want to go travel and do your thing like do that like who cares so it's really up to you and what it comes down to the goal of it but yeah don't just sit in front of your desk for 10 hours a day because you feel like you have to and it especially especially if the math just stays the same because if the math stays the same either your skill set's not there to grow it the desire is not there to grow it or you're just like you're just wasting time like you might as well be doing what you actually you want to do, which could be literally anything. Um, but yeah, I mean, I would I would just continue to lean into that target. So, next one, turning YouTube videos into podcast and which one has the best audio traffic volume? I have no idea. We use Oh, I'm going to blank on this so hard. Uh, I don't remember what we use actually, but we use one and we just hit a million viewers on our main core or listens or whatever on our main podcast, but it has no distribution other than the main platforms. So, all we use is the classic Spotify, podcast, uh, YouTube, whatever, and we just post them through there. So yeah, I don't know. I also haven't turned mine into podcast which I want to do and I have someone messaging me right now and it's like you know thousand bucks or something to convert them all and I just like or I just need to sit down and do it. So um yeah, but I don't necessarily have direct answer for this. I do know that these crush though and that more people like I get a lot of that are like oh can we I want to listen to your stuff at the gym but you know I don't have YouTube premium or I want this. Can I just turn to audio? And I haven't done that. So if you're starting from zero today what would you do? Break it down to task goals. I am not breaking this down for you in quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily basis. Um, I I've made a lot of videos uh about this or other Q&As's. I would do the exact same expert business model. Um, I would find somebody who's already crushing it. Maybe you already with an audience or an audience. Um, reach out to Josh Gavin. Tell him I sent you. Um, and he has one that's called offerpublisher.com, I think is the one. That one is for beginners. It teaches you how to basically run this business model. Um, and that's how I would start in this zone. I also do like lead genen and stuff, but it has a cost accured with it. And I don't think that that beginner should start with it because you're going to spend 10 grand or whatever $2,000 or $500 on testing ads and it's not going to work and you're going to be out money more so than out time and service that you could provide through service. How do you deal with fear? I'm a beginner in agency and I want to ask first question on sales calls interacting. You just bite it. You just you just bite it. So if you have the confidence in it with like that you can actually fulfill on it if you're a beginner in agency. If you don't have it, you need to either fake it till you make it or literally just be so real with people and just be like, "Yeah, I literally have no uh direct experience with this and I'm getting started with it and how about we just do a performance fee and I'm going to run all this stuff and just spend all my time doing it and then I just want an X percentage or when we hit 10% I want, you know, five grand or whatever and then it's easy because you're not selling anything. They don't have to pay you anything. You don't have to fake anything and then you can just have that conversation." So that's how I've always done it is just like performance base everything because I didn't have the confidence to do it even if I did have the skill. So, that's an easy one. Best business start with no experience. Same thing. I would go to offerpublisher.com or whatever. Tell Josh or honestly just DM Josh because it's kind of specific. He has other offerings. So, um self-doubt, procrastination, not knowing what to start. Same thing. Um self-doubt, procrastination, those are things that can be solved. They can be solved through micro actions that you can continuously do. For example, I'm going to go to the gym every single day. You need to like be able to trust in yourself. So, I'm going to wake up at 5 every day. And you don't wake up at 5 every day. Like, you can't even trust yourself. um everything starts there and then then funnels into your skill set and whether you believe that you can fulfill on your actual skill set um and do that then you do that a couple times and you're like oh wait I'm good at this too and oh wait I know that I can get people uh leads or I can get people clients or I can do whatever. So that's a core one daily update find all the other videos here on the dock. Um I have some other links and stuff but I got to zip because we're going on a boat and I think literally they're about to pull out of the driveway. So you guys rock. I appreciate you. Hopefully this was valuable for you and you got some insights and I'll talk to you
