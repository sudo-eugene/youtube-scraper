# He Optimizes 9-Figure Brands like Kinobody, Huel, AG1... (Carl Weische) | EP75
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHHZc9LJ_0w

How are we doing? Good, man. Good. Thank you for having me. Absolutely. All right, guys. In today's video, we got Carl Vicher. Did I say good? Yeah. Perfect. Good. Good. All right. Well, yeah, we connected on X. Um, I've seen his stuff all over YouTube before. I've seen his stuff all over my Instagram. So, excited to talk to him today. So, yeah, just kick it off. What's your uh what's your short long elevator pitch? Uh, sure. So, K 26, born and raised in Germany. Uh, did a lot of different uh ecom stuff. So, I start originally started 10 years ago with uh buying and reselling sneakers like Yeezys, Jordans, Nikes, like all of that stuff when it was still a hype around like 2015, 2016. Uh so that was like my first experience with making money online from the literally children our bedroom which really uh kind of created a spark inside of me like that entrepreneurial make money online spark. So that was the the first thing that I did and then uh over the years just uh tried a lot of different business models from Amazon FBA, Shopify, drop shipping and then 5 years ago started building the company that I'm running today uh with a good friend of mine called Lass. Um he was a freelancer back then for conversion optimization and when I still was running my Amazon FBA and Shopify business, I basically hired him and said like uh let's do some CR on my store. Let's uh please help me with like the copy and everything. And then I was like really fascinated by it and also five years ago um there wasn't really like a lot of awareness or sophistication in the market. So I checked out the at least in Germany the the bubble for agencies who are providing that service and there were basically like two or three and then I saw a lot of potential in that niche and then I said to him hey uh it worked really well why don't we start doing this together and uh yeah then basically 5 years ago we started freelancing together had our first client in 2020 and from then just uh kind of started building the agency building a team and uh yeah just refining it over the years. Nice. Okay cool. So like who's the average client right now? Uh average client. So we really niched down for like conversion optimization AB testing for e-commerce. So average client is a D2C brand that's doing 10 20 30 million a year. So most of our clients are somewhere around that 10 20 30 million per year bracket. Uh we have had some outliers in the past. Uh they were bigger. Um but that's like the kind of the growth stage where most of the brands at least like direct to consumer ecom brands need the service and are also not big enough yet to have their own in-house CR team. So that's where most of the brand side. Yeah, that's why you guys look familiar. So we went through a phase where we were cuz we're all info but initially we're direct to cart info. So we went through a phase where we were trying to do we moved over everything to Shopify, we moved everything to Clavio. We were like trying to do this. We were on zip uh zipify zip pages like we're trying to do all these things and we're like we need somebody to do CRO. So that's why Yeah, you look familiar um there. Okay, cool. Yeah. No, I have um people that are crushing in ecom, but I don't really do physical ecom at all. So like who what's what what's hot now? Is it subscriptions? Is it is it one time? Is it bundles? Is it upsell tracks? Like I don't even know anymore. Good question. So, um I feel like and I'm not in info, so I'm interested to hear your thoughts on that. But I feel like um with info back in the days, like everything was pretty hardcore to like a book a call high ticket funnel and now over the years people started doing more uh low ticket offer, monthly uh monthly revenue models, everything to kind of liquidate ad spend or also grab that like lower end of the market. And with e-commerce, you had a bit of a similar trend where a couple of years ago, you still had like the golden ages where you could basically sell everything on Facebook and be like really profitable on the front end, meaning a lot of uh people that were doing drop shipping or even running brands with inventory. They just had products um that were focused on like the the front-end profitability, right? And then over the years um CPMs exploded, CPAs exploded, consumer behavior shifted a lot. Um I feel like ever since like the Ukraine war, co Trump, like there were so many factors that really shifted consumer behavior and consumer awareness and um that's why we see a big trend to one subscription meaning a lot of back-end revenue so that brands go away from this like front-end profitability first strategy to more of like a let's call it like holistic strategy where they may uh purchase a customer at break even or slight negative on the front end but then try to make the uh on the back end. Um and we also see a lot of brands going away from just uh single product stores, right? We had a lot of single product stores like winning products, whether that's push-up leggings, dog bats, you've probably seen some of them on your IG IG feed before and they did tens of millions of dollars in 2020, 2021, 2022. Um but then from around 2023 especially 2024 we saw this big shift to brands need to have some form of like um customer lifetime value subscription backend revenue to make the overall business more with the really really profitable. So um a lot of the brands that we work together with or that I'm just familiar with or connected with um they yeah they've just obs started obsessing with back end. Yeah. like before that they've just uh obsessed with front end and now like everyone is focused on back end or profitability, right? So yeah, I'm going to pick your brain at some point over this hour about this cuz we're talking about how we're going to do it, but I'm curious. So I have one guy I got connected with here that does 50 I think in in physical product. It was like or he's done 50 or 50. Big difference, but I don't know. I don't remember which. And then I have some buddies that are doing like 15 a month right now and their charts like like just cruising on physically ecom and they do a uh one time or subscription discount style thing like on the initial lander and they're just crushing and it's really like you mean they're like it's the product it's the product like media buys whatever it's like it's the product and then it's like UGC. So, do you still do you see people still doing like the single product ascension stuff? Cuz like when when it was hot for us, it was the ClickFunnels, it was the Otto's, it was that game or is it like all subscription now? I wouldn't necessarily say it's like all subscription, but people just really thought a lot more about what other products can we sell to the customer that are complimentary, right? Because you can only sell so much quantity of the exact same product with OOS's whatever to one customer. So um they started thinking about like bundle offers, complimentary products. One trend that we've seen and also some of the stuff that we pushed for brands that were like half info half ecom where bundle offers of like physical products together with info products. And uh uh we also start seeing this uh this trend more and more coming into e-commerce that people start building bundles uh with info products for example or then they have a physical product let's say supplement right or like a your niche like a weight loss and then they sell them on the backend subscription community info product whatever. Yeah. Yeah. That's everyone always tells us they're like you guys are leaving so much on the table and I have a video on the channel where I'm like we lost you know 1.2 2 million last year doing that because we tried to do it through a partnership instead of doing our own. So, it had like the whole the the direct response style or you know there's a couple guys out there. I don't want to say names but like they do the test kit, you send the test kit back, you know something's wrong, they do the consultation, then they sell you the supplements. So, we thought we could bolt that on as a partnership and it was bad. It was like we were paying for the test kit and so directly out of the margin per unit and then they were booking a call, half were showing to the call or half were sending the test kit back. Half were then shown to the call, half were then buying and like by the time you got to the end it's like we're making $15 in commission and we paid like $300. Like it was bad. But okay. Um what do you see? So do you guys have any specific ones that you work on that are like that are like that that are bolt-on of info? So for example, we had it with uh Kinobody. So with Greg um Kino Yeah. So we did that in 2023 2024 and the beginning of 2023 like one product he was heavily pushing to his organic audience and uh his organic audience and community is insane right it's it's crazy so one of them you probably followed Greg for yeah same I started watching his stuff when I was literally 16 17 literally same um so I feel like every person like our age group kind of has been in contact with his content over the years so um his organic stuff is working amazing and he was pushing this one product called Kenomojo which is like a testosterone booster to his organic audience which worked amazing but then in the US and you've experienced this too is uh like everyone and their mother sold some form of testosterone booster testosterone supplement to the American market meaning crazy high CPMs crazy sophisticated and like high awareness uh market meaning um that's one thing that we did is like bundling the testosterone booster with like the uh kino what was called um the basically like a pre-workout booster Octane. Yeah. Yeah. Komoo Mojo with Kino Octane. And then basically bundled that together with a we call it like a mojo mastery challenge like 30-day challengeish angle with like a community um video course training um nutrition guidelines everything. And uh that together as an offer worked really well. Um, even though it was essentially the same testosterone product like before, but then the perceived value and also the value proposition was like much bigger because we the one angle that crushed for us that we tested a lot was um the dating angle. Mhm. You know, young audience and um basically everything from the dating angle like do you wonder why some girls why some guys magically attract girls sliding from one relationship to the other while you cannot get any dates yada yada yada. And that was the angle that crushed and we had them record a VSSL and everything. And that's why this offer also crushed because it went away from like one specific painoint with one supplement to like the the bigger picture basically for the audience. So what do you guys define as like CRO? Cuz that sounds like you're in there doing complete builds like you're doing full remaging. You're doing full I mean full builds. So is that where do you draw the line on like agency work for where you guys do like just CRO and you're in and like something exists and you're getting two and five because when I think of CRO at least for us and like what we've tried to hire for it's either been like design on page like I don't want to say small tweaks because there are like full builds and like CRO optimizations and audits that we get done but how deep do you go? It's like you just said it's full offer. It's um so basically fast for CRO is everything website right so opt uh uh obviously everything from copy design flow maybe sometimes pre-sale pages thinking about ecom right maybe you've seen those advertorials uh product uh comparisons all of that um but then also one big thing for us is the offer right so um obviously like we didn't do the creatives or media buying or whatever but coming up maybe with a new offer with a variation of the offer with some form of like bundling is also what's included uh from our perspective. So I don't know if it's like in the original sense of CRO that you like work with the offer and stuff but from the way that I view it like everything uh on the website and offer is obviously like one part of the website like uh what is included in the offer, what is the structure, what is the price point, what is maybe the the upsell um mechanism in the back end. Um so that's also something that we often times work with. So either kind of bundling different products, building upsides, cross sites, or even just kind of switching the angle, the messaging or the positioning of the offer. Nice. Yeah. And then you guys do, and you don't have to get exacts, but you guys then generally probably do some sort of like revshare deal, some like base plus revshare or what? Like I I talked to uh Amed on here and he had a very interesting model. So they'll do a revshare deal on the whole thing and then a majority of their stuff is all organic, which I'm not sure for you guys. I'm sure it's a mix, but um they'll do a rev share because they'll touch like the whole thing. They don't have to worry about media buying and creative, but they do have to worry about like organic and then their stuff is just like this massive MR play that does have high ticket on the back end, but like they can get away with revshare and not get away in a bad way, but like it's the business model supports it, which like in our model it generally doesn't. Like these low ticket guys are like, "Oh, I'll build you a low ticket thing and take like x% of all this and backend money." And it's like, "No, you're not getting five or 10% of all rev." Yeah. Um so for us the big chunk of the agency is a flat fee retainer where they basically hire us for like the specific CRO stuff meaning AB testing building epitorials building landing pages and stuff and then I would say a small part like Greg or a couple of other JVS that we have is more of like some form of partnership or joint venture model which is either um retainer uh plus refshare or simply just revshare right so um but there's only like uh one to three that we have at any given moment because it's so much more work and it's also like the involvement of us as the founders because it's like like more higher level business development in that sense and like business strategy rather than just coming in and tweaking some minor things on the funnel uh getting a couple percentage points out of conversion rate AUV and you make a lot of money at that business size. So um yeah to answer the question big chunk is flat fee and then like small chunk of those JVS or partnership deals are more rare. Got it. And what's the So like you said it's you and a co-founder and then like what's the team stack look like or like client load that you guys are comfortable with? Yeah. Um so for those done for you flatf retainer we do around 25. Uh so to put it in context we have 41 people and um Oh wow nice. Yeah. And uh my co-founder basically built the whole organization. So I'm more of like the kind of face and the marketing and sales and everything doing events, social media, all that stuff. And then he is more of like the genie and the the operational guy in the background, right? Um and he basically built this organizational structure we where we have like a sea suite and then below that we have multiple teams of six people. So the way that we've structured it is in parts right a bit uh similar to how the Navy Seal operates. So he basically structured it after the Navy Seals where you have like every like every role is like super specific and every role is like one part of the process right uh but the whole unit uh can work autonomously because in the early days we for example had like a I don't know like a conversion specialist and a designer but then we wouldn't have a developer and whenever we worked with a client we said hey we can do everything for you but you have to program it you have to develop it and that was a huge headache Right? Because we weren't in control of everything. So over the years we started putting everything into this team. So the team is a now it's a data specialist, conversion specialist, designer, developer, and quality assurance person. And then basically like one account manager/ team lead that's managing the team and is taking ownership of everything. So that's why it's six people. So the way that the agency is built is we have multiple of those six people teams and then above that like the seal level and then above that like me and my co-founder and uh then on those 41 people we typically have around 25 accounts. So we never like to go past 25 in terms of the done for you service and then we may have like one to three of those JBs or partnership deals. Yeah, that's an amazing model. That's like uh Eddie Maluof talks about that on his because they have I don't know his exact stack but they have similar where they have like pods that do this. That's how he can do comp that's related to the like offer specific. So he can have bonus like things. He was talking about it on his he's like yeah if we have like a media buyer that for whatever reason like they don't like or like isn't performing. He's like we can like plug one in from another team and like swap those. Yeah. So it that's a cool model because like we're trying to think of how we're building that because for us we just need that internal right. We just need one of those like one core team or what we have done is like the Horoszi model where we hire that out they come like you guys would come in get like these insane results and then we have to try and model it and build it in house because our long-term approach is like full W2 full in-house our own offer generation or ideation design development like the second we go out source we have some risk and we've had that an issue before where agencies either shut down or not done the job or had too many client load and it just like it just doesn't get there. So interesting. Yeah. But I would even I would even argue that with like the info on like a click funnels, you could run it a bit leaner and meaner. Yeah. Because uh with D2C, especially big eight or nine figure brands, everything has to be super high-end pixel perfect, right? So you could for pro most likely cut out the designer and the QA and then probably run with like a team ST of data analyst conversion specialist/copywriter and then developer and you could probably build an inhouse team like that which would be efficient enough for like a the funnel structure you that you have with like optin VSSL application callbook because there's only so much in that funnel most of it is evolving around copy vs sometimes maybe a pop-up or something so nothing crazy in terms of development or design Um, so that's the way that I would probably think about building. What does your uh what does the data specialist look like? Because I'm trying to hire for that team right now because for us it's like the marketing team is growing, but there's that weird like tech data interlink, right? Where you have like you're calling developer data scientists and right now like I built all of ours and then I have a senior tech lead that's come in that knows all of our systems, all the flow rebuilt automations layered in like AI like all these pieces but when it comes to marketing tech I still do it all. So, like it's kind of data, but like we have so many dynamic systems that the data exists, but the reporting on it is such a pain. So, like we're moving everything to the source of truth. But I'm like, what kind of hire would I need in-house? And I think that's probably what you're saying is like a data a data specialist. Like what does that person do? Yeah. Um, so in our team, obviously that person mainly focuses on all of the website data, right? Um, for e-commerce, we typically work with a setup. One would be something like hot jaw, Microsoft clarity where you basically get the screen recordings, heat mapaps, click maps, maybe have something similar on the clickfunnels. Um, and then we would have like a Shopify back end where we have all of the e-commerce data. And then we would have some form of Google Analytics uh back end, right? Where we pull all of the data into. So those are like the main data sources. And then sometimes we do PPS, customer surveys, uh scraping reviews, uh competitor research and all of that which is more like basically one-time work um output. But those would be like the main data tools that he's working with. And then he mainly identifies like uh issues, right, or trends or patterns. Um and then also uh not only on like the the opportunity side, but then also on the customer side. So opportunity side, let's say we have a lot of uh dead clicks, meaning people click on something but it doesn't work um or it doesn't take you anywhere or we have a lot of people dropping off at exactly this part of the page, right? Meaning he identifies opportunity. And then secondly, um it's a bit of like his role and then the conversion specialist to then put their brains together in terms of what can we do at this specific part of the page to get less people to drop off. Yeah. Um but with you guys having also like the um acquisition then the conversion and the retention like there's so much different data points and I would argue that a data analyst can only spend so much time within the funnel because there's only like four or five pages um that you could probably maybe hire like some form of like an AAR data analyst um who's super familiar with info but he can also analyze uh acquisition data on like different uh platforms like Google or Facebook but then also retention data or CRM data. Um because yeah, I mean you have him fulltime, 40, 50 hours per week. Maybe he needs like 10 15 hours on the funnel and that's about it. And then you can leverage them for those other um positions as well because to be fair the I mean you know to the data it's it's not necessarily that groundbreaking different between it. It just says different things, but the way you think about it and analyze it and come up with ideas is uh it's pretty similar. Yeah, that's probably so nice because you guys I assume almost all your clients are Shopify, right? Like you said, backend like that's so nice. You have centralized systems, you have centralized all that. For us, it's like you said, it's those three different layers. It's like the it's like marketing, sales, fulfillment are like the simple buckets and then how these are kind of grouped together in a in acquisition. So, you have all your different touch points because we're running three funnels. We have we do have organic, but it's never first click. So, like journeys and then the big one is this backend piece. And we have for far too long put it off to get like accurate data around there to get cash collection percentages to get ascension or like renewal information to get activation points within the product to do you know based on NPS it's stored here when they do reviews you know trigger conversations like all of that doesn't exist because the data doesn't exist in a good way. So like that's the big overhaul we're doing but that's super interesting. So when you guys are doing like what do you see working now in in terms of tracking in terms of like that stuff cuz I know people are on high roast like you said we're on clarity we're on high we have a custom pixel setup we have we have like you know nine different things we only use highros for the journey because it's the best we've seen where you can like view everything and all the touch points but we use a completely like custom setup for uh pixel that'll fire things like independently on for example we do our purchases on when someone signs the terms Because a big thing with call funnels is you'll accept the payment like over a zoom like this or on the phone and the client never fills out the payment form. So you don't get the browser side versus like Shopify, right? Do you see? They're like filling it out. So it's very easy to just go browser server send it back. But for us it's not. So we have it set up on the terms that are like these dedicated unique IDs that then they fill it out. So it shows browser comes back into here, centralizes the payment information, like collects it and then does server. So they're like in alignment. But like that's just I don't say more difficult but just like it has to be custom in some of these ways. So like what do you guys see works? Is it as simple as you just plug in Hyros and you plug in Shopify pixels and it works? So with Shopify yes it's way easier because um uh the only difficult part is the check out because they're super pro protective about the checkout and like passing on data. Um but everything happens online and mostly it's like a pretty straightforward journey. So with a core funnels, high ticket funnels, you have like so many touch points, you would have uh the same on Shopify. If it's like a high AOV, like 500, 1,000 like furniture or whatever or like luxury goods, but everything else like $50, $100, $200 products like supplements, shoes, jewelry, accessories, fashion. Um it's mostly like uh one maybe two sessions that get them to buy. Uh so it's uh pretty easy with Hyros or some other attribution form. a dream. Yeah. And then you have everything in Shopify and then the only thing that we do is set up like clarity or ha and then Google tech manager with Google litics for all of like the the the custom data points like how many people click the button, how many people open the menu, how far do they scroll, how much time do they spend and everything else with info. Um we haven't done that much info or book a call funnels to be fair. Uh, so I would think the the way that you've set it up is probably the the best some form of like combination of highways with some form of like internal tracking system. Yeah. How do you guys get away with or like do you do you constantly have to navigate the whole you don't touch media buying cuz I feel like that's such a big part of it um of like I mean consistency of quality volume. How do you guys get away with just being this portion of it? Like do you do referrals a lot of time or like partnerships with guys you know that just do that or do they usually have an in-house team or Yeah, great question. I would say half of them already have like a stellar in-house team or partner and the other half of the time we just bring in our partners. Um because the the thankful part about my um ICP is that it's a super smart, super intelligent entrepreneur because I'm typically talking to the founder. The minimum that I'm talking to is like the sea suite um or some form of shareholder. And in e-commerce, they are all pretty much the same. They've have they've had like a drop shipping background. They've built everything from the ground up. They know everything and they are super smart. Meaning uh when they in a call with me like it's it's not even that I have to close them with like a script or something. It's more of like um like a I take the order basically because they know exactly what they want and they know that they hire me for like one specific point and then it's the um the only thing that makes it like uh easy for us regarding the whole situation around like media buying different quality of traffic is that obviously when we run split tests we can always uh compare against the baseline that they have even though when it goes up and down right so one day the conversion rate may be 3% and 3.5 and the very end then the next day it's maybe like two in 2.2. So it basically goes up and down for like the whole month and then we look at the the the data historically. But then it's u it's pretty easy for us to like show the data and say hey this is how both of them performed over the month even though you may have had new creative or different media buying or new channels or whatever that change the quality mix of the traffic. Um but uh that's it's a s really grateful for your job because everything is so databased and we can just show uh show show it basically. Yeah, we ran internal for the first like the co-founder of the company. So I came in as co-owner. So the one of the co-founders was is super good in marketing and sales. So he was spending still when we were at like 20k a day in spend. So he was still managing it all. And then we tried agency. Then we tried like full agency where we only had just media buying. Then we had contract. like we bounced around it like everywhere. And right now we have uh our CMO crushes and he could do it himself, but now we have a contractor that does all the big info guys. So there's like a couple guys and I'm sure you know and I'm not going to say names on here, but I'm sure you know who they are if you look around a little, but they do, you know, three different guys that are doing 10 million a month and it's all ecom and info. I find that a lot of guys are willing to do both and that there's a lot of overlap, which is interesting because I feel like they're not there's a lot of similarities, sure, but there's a lot of things that are different, especially with like time to sale, like you said, one or two uh one or two sessions. Ours is like, you know, we can have an average 20some day cycle depending on the funnel type of initial click or initial, you know, opt-in. So, yeah, that's super interesting. Super interesting. I mean, I would Would you would you guys ever think to take that part over or you're just trying to stay in your lane? Just stay in my lane. I mean uh so to be fair I've stepped into info I stepped into book a call I've stepped into SAS funnels in terms of clients but uh I would say it's pretty different because um with with all of those funnels uh that's I mean that's why it's called a funnels like the the user can only go one straight line that you basically build for him right with e-commerce um we've also used a lot of funnels over the years but I would say that still only like 20 to 25% of all of the traffic goes to funnels where they can only go one direct path, right? A lot uh a lot of other times if you think about fashion, jewelry, like big catalog brands where they have multiple products. So not AG1 or whatever, but like multiple skew brands. Uh the user stays on the website maybe 10 minutes, goes from homepage, collection page to one product page, back to collection page, another product page, puts one in the cart, goes back to homepage, uh wants to learn about the brand, goes back to product page, puts another product in the cart, then cart, then checkout. So it's it's such a different journey where it's uh it's not necessarily that you optimize for they just like clickthrough rates of the one funnel but also a bit of like touch point optimization where like every single touch point because they visit so many different pages the UXUI the navigation the menu everything has to be super smooth and cannot have any friction. It's also about a lot about like touchpoint optimization and not necessarily only pushing them through this uh one funnel. So we also do have certain brands that just have like a advertorial sales page, check out Otto uh done, right? But uh a lot of those brands I would say it's it's like fundamentally different to info. Yeah, video's lagging a little too. So sorry if I'm delayed in my response, but no, the what do you see as I have um I'm I talk to every once in a while Mark runs brands. Mark scales brands and his stuff it just cracks me up. He's like, "Can I get on shirt list?" I'm supposed to talk to him later today. He's like, "Can I get on shirt list?" I'm like, "Sure, dude. Get on." Um, but he always talks like advertorial like he talks that model right there. Right. Yeah. So, do you is that your main is that the main one that works for you guys? I mean, I'm sure there's a million where you said cuz you already said direct product page like some of these other funnels, but as advertorial, listical, is that the game right now? Uh, definitely. I mean, it's uh everything works, right? Um, I I'm not a big fan of like generalizations, but think of it as like one uh tool in the toolbox, but it's definitely a really great tool because it's uh the consumer doesn't really understand that he's being sold something. So maybe he's on uh new york times.com and then he sees like a banner something like understand your body type and how to eat to get a six-pack this summer and then he clicks on it and then it's like a quiz page with like 20 questions and he just go through the quiz and then it's like a results page and then uh he's being sent an offer via email or on the results page he's being pitched but then he's like 10 minutes into the funnel invested a lot of time and energy and then he understands that he's being sold something right. Uh same with like advertorial um maybe it's a different headline like doctor reveals the best uh I don't know the best um skinincare treatment you can use against acne and then you click on it and then it's like a third party avitorial and you learn about all of the different ingredients what to watch out for when you buy skinincare and then obviously the doctor pitches you one skincare solution from one brand says why it's so amazing and then you click on the call to action and then you get to the product page but then again you're so deep in the funnel and you while you're being advertised and sold to, you didn't understand it, right? Because you um you believed them or you trusted them, but then you're so invested that then you're just going to buy. And that's why those funnel types work so well for e-commerce. But then again, it's uh you cannot really use that in fashion, jewelry, accessories. So there's like certain niches, especially consumable products, supplements, health, and awareness where it works amazing. But then for other niches, the ones that I just mentioned, uh then it's a completely different game. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. So, like the problem based stuff you have you want you try to use more direct response style. Interesting. Have you guys ever done the like VSSL game, right? You've got the ClickBanks of the world and all that, but we started to watch some of because we're trying to navigate right around this whole supplement game on we don't want to distract ourselves and there's for us it's like the full stack. I mean, so I guess same for your clients where they're going to have to fulfill on it. They're going to have to have some unique thing. They're going to have to do the whole like actual part of the business. But the marketing side we're like okay so off the rip do we you know hormosy this or some of these other bigger fitness plays where they they'll sell that those five to seven core you know fitness supplements which are your creatines your you know your pres your proteins post purchase. So the marketing stack is just like non-existent. It's just like an additional monetization model. It occurs as recurring. Even if they stop paying you for info or coaching or whatever they maybe still stay on subscription. But the difference between selling it like that versus selling direct on the front end is like night and day in at least our eyes. It's like this is already you acquired the customer and it's just like an in addition this is first click you're acquiring them through that. So we're trying to study all these other guys like Golden Hippo and um like our friends we were talking about that do like 15 a month like they crush it with like a long form page. They have some like ancillary pages but a majority are there on that one main product page that it almost acts like as both. So, have you guys tried that? Like the hard the hardcore VSSL game where it's VSSL to, you know, bundle order style? Definitely. Um, I mean, then again, the the best niche that we found that to work in is supplements. Um, so we've had different styles and variations of those. So for example um the ads that I just talked about where it's like a curiositydriven uh image creative um to advertorial for example and then the advertorial pitches a video presentation that gives the solution to the problem that the uh audience is facing and then it's it's literally just the VSSL and then you have to play it for like the VSSL is like 45 minutes and you have to play it for 20 minutes and then after 20 minutes uh the sales page underneath opens with the product testimonials and then you can buy but you don't see the product until you're 20 minutes into the VSSL. So that's one variation we had. And then the second variation is uh that style of quiz funnel that I was talking about earlier. Um which is like a also challenge based funnel meaning um like 90day challenge to get to your dream body. And then you put in like your your current like body weight uh body size and then kind of your um what is it called like the metabolism type like how skinny fat you are and everything else. And then um while you wait for the results and then there's a results bar at the top, you have a VSSL at the bottom. And then it says uh play this video to start getting your results. And then we have a progress bar on the video which like moves really fast in the beginning and then it starts getting slower and slower and slower over time. So then again they have to watch like 5 minutes something off the VSSL to get the results. Um and then the results page is basically the sales page. Yeah. So those two work uh amazingly well in the supplement. That's super interesting. It's like it's I love these conversations cuz it's like how much am I leaving on the table? We There's so many times where I've looked at something and I've been like cuz like I said I do the marketing tech and for the longest time I built all that. So we rammed like $70 million through one VSSL funnel and we're like oh what if we did a quizunnel or we did this and I'm like well how would we track it or like how would we set it up? So, we just don't and it's like that's such a foolish like short-term limiting, you know, mindset of instead of just hiring someone to build it or building it ourselves to test it, you know, more concerned about what the data is going to look like or the flow so it's consistent for a sales rep instead of like cuz that's the other issue for us is like everything goes to a sales rep. So testing these things over here can vastly change like the quality that can come into a so for a great example is we ran similar to what you're saying but the direct to app or direct to VSSL. So headline VSSL and then initially when we launched it the CTA was right there. So because instead of buying something direct they're applying and then booking a call. So we ran that and our cost per call you know is 30% of what it is when it runs through the main but the show rates the close rates like not there because they weren't gated. So then we had to change the whole application then you know it was only 50% cheaper call but consumption was or not consumption was the same but like the friction and the routing of them we were just like kicking people out of the application left and right. It's like if they said this it's like nope you don't qualify you don't qu like being actually strict with that cuz I don't know all these info businesses that take anybody or these education that are like we take everyone. It's like we can't take everyone because then we don't get them result and then the feedback loop is like super negative. we we feed the pixel wrong and the customer community doesn't get wins. So, we started to route that way and then the new version is similar to what you're saying where it's like a five minute delay on the CTA cuz our VSSL on that we have multiple on that one but it's like 20 something minutes but even the five minute one it's crazy the difference in cost per call or like the throughput on it but the quality is night and day. So, like I'm super interested to see and maybe we'll, you know, I'm sure we'll talk closer too when we do this with actual supplements and direct to cart because we have no experience with this like zero experience with direct to cart in that way. And like we're trying to look at it like how do you do the product initially because you're not going to sell a protein powder or a pre-workout like in that way like you need to sell like a a niche specific problem style thing and that's how all these big supplement guys do. It's like especially on the ClickBank game. It's like this huge thing. Then it's this unique mechanism supplement and like we got to dance that line cuz like we don't really play in the gray. We definitely don't play in the black. But like where is it that it's like actually unique? It's actually custom. And again our friends are guys that like crushed it in this. Love the product. Makes sense. They just dominated a market with something that was already like male dominant and then made it made it to female. Um but yeah, those different styles are super interesting like and and that's why they have to justify the bundles, right? because they need to try and recoup the cash instead of subscriptions. Uh yeah, for example, I mean it's uh it's a if you think about it, it's pretty similar if you sell them on like a three bottle um front end offer like six bottle front end offer in comparison to putting them on like a one bottle subscription per month and then maybe they churn after 3 4 months, right? Yeah. So, it's it's super super similar, but it's uh happy to send you some fun because we have different brands that do crazy numbers in the US anywhere from like 2 and a half to 10 million with like uh men's skin care, men's hair care, men's supplements, and it's the exact same funnel uh on funnelish uh with like 10 15 questions um around like their pain points, their desires and goals and everything pushed to like one sales page um even without a VSN. It's uh it's super interesting me because it's literally I can uh share them with you afterwards because it's the exact same funnel with different branding, different product, but the funnel mechanism is so uh crushing that uh they just duplicated for like different products basically. Yeah. Is that the tech stack that everyone's using nowadays? So funnelish on top of Shopify. I don't even know how that works. So most of the brands they run all of like the branded high-end stuff on Shopify. Also Shopify front end and Shopify checkout. And then they run a lot of the direct response stuff on funnelish on like third party domain. So it's not necessarily connected to their uh like holy grail brand. Yeah. Yeah. And everything. So yeah, that's typically the text. Cool. Yeah. I uh I'd always get the itch like I think physical ecom is so cool. So I I I've talked about it on here before, but I was like I want to do like a dog brand. Like I got all this free time. The info company was like slow. It was the end of Q4. We didn't know if we wanted to make it a cash flow biz or if we wanted to just crank it, which as we now have decided, we're just going to crank it and just scale the out of it. But, uh, I was like, I'm going to do this dog store product and I'm getting I'm like back in the trenches. I'm like on every Shopify course you can imagine. I'm getting shrine theme. I'm like designing these things until 3 in the morning and and in the end the guy who you you see who wins when you're doing the drop ship game, but like you see who ends up spending the most or who has all that the most ads and these guys were crushing it with an advertorial and after the fact after I turned it all off. I like sent it to a bunch of guys in these direct response community and they're like, "Oh yeah, they're using funnelish for this. They're using this and this." Like if you would have done this, I'm like, "Okay, like it's just so out of my domain." But yeah, it's funny. So, so for you guys, um, some of the funny questions I like to ask on these, like what's the craziest launch, a lot of the time so far it's been info guys, some other guys who have done exits, but like what's the craziest I know you said Kino Body that probably did some size and some numbers, but and you don't have to name names, but like what what's the biggest build or something crazy that you guys have done in in client load? Um, so we have uh this one uh German supplement brand. It's crazy to say, but they do a billion dollars a year in uh D2C um in Germany, which is like a super small market, but they basically crack the game of influencer. So, every single big and small influencer, athlete, fighter, whatever you name it, they they have under contract in Germany. They all almost have like a online monopole and they are not even spending that much on ads, but like the influencer and the organic drive. Uh so with them uh we've done a couple of uh launches and a couple of like um yeah everything from like breakfast Monday to different product launches which were all eight figures because they had such a huge community. Yeah. So, uh, everything we build, everything we launch was, uh, yeah, was just crazy because of the the size that they already at, right? I often times think of certain stuff when when we touch it or when we launch something new or when we run a split test or something and then I'm thinking, um, yeah, it's nice on this brand that's doing 10 million per year, but if we would have done it on the same brand, everything the same, but it's doing a 100 million per year, there would be such a bigger outcome, you know. Yeah. Um but yeah, those were those are definitely some uh some interesting ones. Yeah. Yeah. I I often bring up and I question this in what I do is like how how far can you take it or how far do you want to take it? Like what is the depth in which you choose to go? So for you guys right now you have I don't know the total client load but you know sounds like hundreds or you know 25 a pod and doing that like that sounds pretty aggressive. Is there what's like the the end play? Is it build a big agency that sounds like it's exitable, right? It sounds like it it could be exitable if you want to do that or Yeah. Uh so just to correct it's 25 in total. So not 25 per pot. Every pot has around like Yeah. Five to six brands. Okay. Yeah. Um so 25 in total and then like one to three JVS and then we are at capacity because of like all of the like I was like wow 25. No no that's why I just figured I'm going just jump in there. Yeah. No. So 25 total which is already like for us big and we don't want to go past that because we went to like 30 or 35 in like the last years and that's when we saw like systems break uh in terms of like monthly output that we have to deliver with like tests and landing pages and everything. So we just kind of put it down a bit again because I'm a big believer in in quality and it's uh um exactly what you said right now. So, we a bit thinking about like a merger with the uh one good friend that I mentioned before the podcast and then potential exit because of like the um the agency that we've built. It's a it's not necessarily like a plug and play you can plug like any brand into and it's no work. It's always work but it's a it's like a really thankful business model. So, I'm not in the space where I run a Facebook ads agency and somebody comes to me with like 100k in spend and then I have to have a crazy creative output and maybe it's a home run, maybe it's not. We only have clients that have successful businesses and it's more about like squeezing a couple of percentage points out and beating their current fun by a couple of percentage points, which is not easy of course, but it's a really thingful business because they've cracked everything. Like everything is running. They're spending mid six to seven figures per month. Uh they have a lot of traffic. They have a lot of data, the offer is working, everything is working already. So, um, us coming in and with our like systems and experience just tweaking it a bit and getting a bit more out of the funnel, it's not an easy service to deliver. Um, but it's definitely I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of a ads creative agency or like Facebook agency to compare. So I would say also for because we we've talked to some different M&A firms or PE firms, it's like way easier to to duplicate it or like projected in the future um than businesses where it's like uh every single client they take on every every single case they take on has to be like super crazy growth case otherwise they don't make money, right? Um or they have to crack a way bigger problem than we have to. uh which makes it potentially interesting for us to exit and uh I mean we've been in the game for like 5 years now around so for us the past 5 years has just about been um like kind of pushing the the throttle and see where we can take it and uh yeah it's been pretty interesting so far we've basically ticked every like dream client out of of our list so we at the stage now where we where we more think about like JVS partnerships potential merger potential exit a bit of like what's next now. Um, but yeah, that that would bas definitely be uh an interesting case for us. Yeah. Yeah. You're like the third person I've talked to that had the like foresight to start to talk to private equity or start to talk to some of these guys cuz like you hear things and like me for example like I've heard things and I like kind of know but I've never directly you know we have no idea who or if you know 0.001% 01% probably sell in the info coaching space and I'm like you know dying on the hill that of the people that have tried it's probably a higher hit rate of people who have sold like th those who have actually tried to get to the point where they remove the founder and expert and like build it out to be a real business and scale not just an offer I would argue that those guys who have actually done that have either gotten really close or actually sold. So it's probably a 20 you know there's only a couple guys I know of that have sold but most people don't even try right like most people don't try and build it in a way like you are where it's seuite and it's pods and it's specific like yes at some level they try and productize their deliverable or like their service but they never try to get to a point where they have like full seuite because as you and I both know you're lighting you know not lighting on fire but like you're you're getting you're biting that part of the margin so that you can have lifestyle so that you can have potential exit so you can have these things versus trying to manage all the pods your guyselves but make another million bucks a year or 500, you know what I mean? So that's interesting. So like you think that I feel like that's totally exitable. I mean depending on how you guys go about it. I don't know how much you you said your sales marketing and like the front end, but so the goal is I was about to say like uh I think you would potentially even have it easier than me because you're not your face isn't all over it, right? So that's like the the biggest thing um that we would have to crack over the next couple of years. I mean uh we've talked to some different firms and they all said either way for us running an agency which is like pretty founder driven especially with like the face and the brand because it's so reliant on the personal brand and the network of the founder it's more of like a 3 to 5 year plan whenever like you would never do like a 100% exit where they just say hey here's a couple mill [ __ ] off let me get the agency and you live on the Bahamas or whatever it's more of like they buy like a half of the business and say hey let's build this together over the next 5 years and get you out of the business. Um, but for you guys, I mean, uh, you probably know William Brown, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, uh, he made it pretty smart where his face, he had like an anonymous funnel where his face or his name or brand wasn't really associated with it, making it pretty easy. I think he said something like six week or 8 week like transition period from him getting out of the business and like giving everything to the the new owner, which is crazy to think, right? 6 to 8 weeks. So, um, straight out literally and then just done. Yeah. I mean it's uh I think it would be really interesting for you to talk to some of those M&A or PE firms just also to get their understanding of how do they value a business because you and I we're like really performance marketing background. So we really look at like CPA, COVID, gross profit, yada yada yada and they just think about it like completely differently like keyman risk and like a game plan like new audiences, new markets, whatever. Uh which is also super interesting. Yeah. No, it's it's a different game. I talked to one guy and yeah, for us, so like back to the example of us though, the one of the co-founders is the main brand face and like two years ago, we start to have this conversation. It's like if this thing is ever going to get in that direction, like we have that extreme risk and we had it at at on the uh product side and we had it on the marketing side. So it was like brand face and then also led like the coaching portion or the info group coaching like that part of it. So we phased that entire portion out on the back end. So completely out of fulfillment and then it was just like brand face and all the all that piece and then the next layer is now we have multiple brand faces and she exists as one of the brand faces. So we have two other ones that are more in demo. So we're like like you said like one year, three year, 5 year later we're like slowly getting to this but we have full dedicated BSL funnels being made right now with the other faces that are then going to have full low tickets with the other faces. And you know we own all the IP. They're they're not you know on the cap table per se, right? Like they're just they're just brand faces. Um, but they crush. They absolutely crush. Like we we're only testing their ads right now and sending them to the main funnels that are the the core brand face and they're still working. Nice. So like there, you know what I mean? Like there's not continuity where it's like, "Oh, I'm this person then this." Like it still works. So we're we're pretty excited to try that. But I have a guy that I know that's small right now in info. Like half a million a month maybe. They're trying to press for a million this month and I think last month they were uh at 500. But they have a super interesting perspective where the expert is somebody who has already been through multiple exits. So he like understands the game and then decide to come into basically consulting expert whatever thing and is having the business built around him but they're already like having fractional CFOs that are building everything in a way that PE can just like import it, right? So like they're building their team and their consulting stuff that they have around like a CFO that does this like a fractional COO that builds the things in a way that like they're very attractive to a buyer. So or Yeah. They're very attractive. Yeah. Exactly. To a buyer. So that they are trying to focus on that from the get which is super interesting to me because I'm like oh we didn't even think about that like at all. Like we have you know if these guys looked at how our financials are booked they'd be like what like it's going to take them a month to unwind or try and put it into their models. Same thing with fulfillment data. That's why I'm trying to work on that right now is like they don't they're not going to have enough data and and like ability to model anything unless it's built in a way that they can accept it. So I'm like that's it's an interesting thought. I don't know I don't know how to navigate that other than just pay top dollar for some of these like private equity trained guys to come in and do fractional, you know. No. Yeah. Interesting. Okay, cool. So what is the I guess goal of what I see you on info stuff. I see you up on stages. I see you up on like So what's the play there? Is that the personal brand stuff that then leads to agency clients? Is that you guys also do info? I think that's the your friend you were talking about as well. I see you guys doing a bunch of stuff. Uh so we've done a me like uh the whole reason I built the personal brand, the audience, the YouTube and the the stage stuff and masterminds is like all of that you funnel to agency clients. Um in the past like we've only done done for you. So 100% white love service which is why we always kept at like that 25 clients total. We could only scale with like raising prices um which is fine but now over the past um one year we've basically built like a done with you service. Um so which is I don't know how you want to call it or what it's called officially but some form of like leveraged info service. So they they basically have like a a bit like the Cole Gord model. So they uh it's like a you have uh one C uh customer success manager you have some form of like training and SOPs but this customer success manager um audits your business builds a road map for you gives you the action items and basically tells you what of the SOPs and trainings to do in which order and how to apply it to your business and then basically has like weekly check-ins with you select channel you can access 24/7. So we've literally just launched it in March and just started selling it because for us that's like the the area of the business that's like way more scalable because then one CSM can handle 20 25 accounts. Um yeah which is way more scalable than like one team of six people can handle five or six accounts. Um so yeah uh obviously we we cannot charge the same because it's not like a done for you high-end service. uh but it still is uh makes sense if you look at the KPIs and math in the background. So that's kind of something that we started building because over the past 5 years I've said no to hundreds of people that had a seven figure business for the done for you service because they were too small. So they had the money ready and then uh me and my co-founder we just looked at each other and say like are you dumb? We don't have anything to sell. How can you say no to people then want to buy from you? So that's why we built this like done with you offer which is like cheaper and more accessible to like bigger Tom um but we I never wanted to go into like um a community low ticket MR or whatever because like the reason that I have my face on everything is like I'm I'm kind of putting my reputation on the line and with the done for you service uh that's fine with me because I can control my team who controls the results. With the done with you service, we communicated pretty directly that we can give them everything and we can do the best, but they have to execute. So, the responsibility is on them. Um, but we still like the customer success manager with like the 101 stuff. It's like pretty intense. Um, but I never wanted to go the route of like low ticket MR community or whatever because I didn't want someone to pay me a hundred bucks for like some some form of like video training and then they have to figure everything out. And that's why I just basically put uh the YouTube channel and everything out for free, which is uh I would rather have that funnel into like the done for you clients or now also done with you clients rather than kind of getting that entry level of the market of like five, six uh figure brands. Um yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah. No, I'm in a similarish style. Like I don't sell anything and I have all these different and like people are like, "Oh, you should do this or oh, just do a community. Do one that's 100 a month or do one that's 20k for the like only do a high one." I'm like, I don't want to do any of this. Like, I don't want to think about it. I don't want to worry. Exactly what you're saying, like reputation or someone comes in and they don't like I don't need to I don't need to do that. Like, it's just not even part of it'd be a brand new business. That's just unnecessary. So, like I'm just doing exactly what you're saying, YouTube style. I'm trying to stay away from the 0 to 10k stuff or five six figure, you know, people as much as I can, but some of the stuff overflows down. But, yeah, that's interesting. So, for the done with you, does that do those guys ascend ever to done for you? Um I mean we've just launched it in March but some of the guys that we closed in March um they were like uh let's say like one step be uh before they qualify for the done for you in terms of monthly ref and like monthly volume. So um we basically closed them and said hey listen guys 90day done with you sprint and then you're probably going to be big enough and have all of the foundations handled that you can then ascend and [ __ ] they're done for you. So I would like my hypothesis is that we can probably ascend like 20 30% of those brands over like a like shorter time frame like six monthsish to the done for you. Probably there's still going to be like a big chunk that just stays at the seven figure level. Um but we've seen a lot of cases where they uh scale quickly then. Yeah. Interesting. Cool. We're coming up on 55, but I got to know. So what's the this is like a selfish one because it's something I'm navigating right now. So you do all of the personal brand stuff. you do your, you know, your portion, which is still an insane and like in my opinion like a a higher lever piece of the business, right? Where you're doing consistent acquisition, you have to have your name out there, like you said, reputation, all that stuff. Like how do you balance or like what's the time breakdown like for you? Cuz it's something I'm like massively struggling with where I'm trying to do like these right now like this, you know, first meeting of the day, then I'm rolling into all this operation stuff, then I'm trying to like engage on X and YouTube. Like what's your what's your life look like if you don't mind me asking? No. No. I mean it's a like first of all like your consistency is unmatched. I mean you've you've put out the amount of videos in two months that I put out in like 3 years just to compare. So um it doesn't much necessarily quality sometimes. Yeah. So I've looked at a lot of like those different social medias and like sprints. So for example 2022 2023 I've spent like 20 hours a week on X on building X. Um and then I moved that to YouTube. Um, then I moved that to LinkedIn. Now back now I've been slacking a bit with YouTube. So I want to like pump that out again. Um, but basically the way that I think about it is um, like the first half of my day. So I get up at like 7ish, go to the gym and then start work at 9:30. So 9:30 to 12 is like deep work for me for content like recording, scripting, fe like feedbacking, improving um, for like content or operations. And then I have lunch from 12 to 1. Then probably like 1 2 3 I have another like deep dive slot. And then from 3 to 7, 3 to 8 I just take calls like sales calls, ops calls, teams calls, hiring calls, whatever. And that's basically how I structure the day. So I would say 50/50 between like deep work in the morning and then calls or whatever in in the like afternoon, evening. Um, but I've also hired a content marketing manager who basically um I've trained him now since August to take over like all of the writing for LinkedIn. Um, and now we're going to duplicate that on X and then he also prepares YouTube videos for me, right? So, we just trying to crack that now so that I can only record. I don't know how you manage it right now if you build all of those like my robots yourself. Um do I've been there in the past like building 50 page docs for like 50 hours and then it's like one one hour video and whatever. So it's crazy input for like one video. So I'm trying to crack that now where I've trained him basically so that he can get it to like 80 90% of the content that I want to have. Then I fine tune it and record it and he's doing the editing thumbnails pushing it live and stuff. So that's what I'm trying to crack right now to be have consistent output because uh I mean you've probably seen it too over the past two months. Um this like nichish personal brand and authority just blows up your network opportunities and everything. It's like the has a crazy positive uh ROI and impact on the business both like business and personal life. Um which is why I'm so obsessed with consistent output on all platforms but I've never managed consistent output on like all platforms simultaneously. So that's what I'm working with right now, but that's also why I hired this like full-time person. Um, so I can like the ideal state is that I just record YouTube videos and based on that that translates into repurposed content for like LinkedIn and X. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean it's crushing. I've seen your stuff everywhere. So it definitely works whatever you're doing. But that's interesting cuz I the time blocking is something I'm not good at. Like I do make all those mirror boards and they're so simple. Like some of them the deep ones I have to do them at like 5 in the morning. like I have to do like the big funnel build ones that are connecting to this. Any of the math ones are like the modeling of like cash flow or gross margin calculators like I have to get up at five which is like pretty normal for me. And then I have but I have to like not open Slack, not open email and just like do those record it right right then and then like I'm for the rest of the day it's just talking and decisions and stuff like that. But I'm trying to get into that flow cuz I mean what's the time zones like for you guys? Cuz you're in that bucket like you you guys travel, you do that, right? You're not just like locked at the desk, right? Uh I try to be locked at the desk. So the past three years I did a lot of traveling. Now I just want to be here. So I'm trying to not travel anymore. Yeah. I used to party like crazy, travel like crazy and like I only really was focused on the tech side. So it was like problem solve it, automate it, and then didn't have to worry about it. It was way less like people as it is now. So now it's more meetings, now it's more operations, it's like, you know, actual business building, not just like marketing tech builds. Um, but that massively shifted my life. It's like I I don't know how people can travel like they can. I mean, I know how they can. They just have the right the right teams. They have the right structure, but it's just such a skill that I have not mastered. We're going to go to that Eman event in London, and I'm like I'm like three or four days doing this. I'm like, I haven't been in a different time zone for that amount of time in a in a long time at with this responsibility. I have not. It's been Yeah. So interesting to see how people do it and interesting to see how people like Iman has talked about how he you know shows up in films basically and has the team built around where the scripts and stuff exists and like of course he is like the underlaying of all of this or the foundation is probably a better way to say like of all of this but he can do that. Hormosi says the same thing. He he shows up they shoot you know four hours of things and it's like boom out to go. I'm like sitting there I'm like what should I talk about today? Like let me make a mirror board. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Well cool. Anything uh anything else specific you want to cover or we can we can pop. I know I'm sure you got something. Uh I think we can pop. Uh has been amazing to talk to you. It was also really interesting that I could ask one or two questions to you to get your perspective on it. So I appreciate it and it was nice meeting you. No, it was nice meeting you. You're uh you're absolutely crushing it and I've definitely seen your name around. So it was good to connect through this and just funny the network that has come just from doing YouTube next like I knew who you were but I you know never met. So it's great. Well cool. So people find you on what? What's the main one you want them on? X YouTube. uh everywhere basically, but I'm most active on Instagram to reply to messages. I got to ask now that you opened the kimono. So, that's the one that I have no idea how to use because I sit at my desk all day. So, it's like what do you share on there? You know what I mean? Like every I'm pretty fortunate that I did all of the traveling the past three years and now I just sit on my desk. So, I have like all of the content already done. So, yeah. That's fair. That's fair. I guess I could do that. I do have a lot of old stuff, but it's like I I never know what to do. like the last four things I post on Instagram is like like a picture like this and it's us on a meeting or it's us doing chart or it's someone shared something. I'm like, "Okay." But okay, so we'll get back to that one. But cool. All right, we'll kick it here. Find them everywhere and talk to you guys tomorrow on what's today? Day 75. So tomorrow will be day 76.
