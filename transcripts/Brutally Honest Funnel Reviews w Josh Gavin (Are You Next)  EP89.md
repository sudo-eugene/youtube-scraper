# Brutally Honest Funnel Reviews w/ Josh Gavin (Are You Next?) | EP89
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESx4Dl8it3o

What's up, guys? Today we are back. Episode 89 in a row. We've got Josh Gavin who's returning onto here and we're going to do something fun today. We're going to do some live funnel reviews. So, he queued up some of his followers and had them send in some funnels and submit them. I had a couple on a tweet or expost or whatever you call it nowadays. And we're going to go through it. So, Josh, you want to share first? You want me to share? How do you want to play? Let's pull up yours. We had a guy who shared a funnel. Um I think it was in the photography niche. We'll pull him up. Uh dropped his link. So obviously one thing I'll say is we tried to ask for as much data as possible because obviously finance like the numbers are everything. And so luckily we have some stats on this one. Some of these other ones have some stats. So we're going to make our best guess, Ryan. But uh either way, we're going to beble to give some ideas for potential future split tests and changes that could have some major lifts at scale. So let's uh let's check this one out, though. All right. So, this guy sent his full sales page, upsell one, two, and three, which I assume are where right here. Yeah. Um, dang, he's got so many pages. Yeah. I mean, okay. So, yeah. Purchase to complete. I'm sure that's something else. I don't know. All right. So, 2.78% conversion on cold traffic. Constraint is he can't get his AOV up because he's at $65 AOV. The CPA. He said retargeting CPA is 27 to 42, which I don't know why that matters, but CPA for cold is 70 to 110 first or last click depending. I don't know why that's okay. And they sent me the ad library. We offer photography coaching subscription. Okay, so you might be fine, brother. Uh, if you have a subscription, your LTV might literally be so it doesn't matter about your I mean not gonna say it doesn't matter, but um 2K ascension on the back and 7.5K ascension on the back need a different Yeah. What? Yeah. So, does he have his front what does he liquidate on the front end? Does he share anywhere? I mean, he said right here. I mean, if it's if it's AOV 65 spending and it's costing him basically that 70 to 110 like he's already crushing. Yeah. Okay. So this is a classic uh people get sold the idea from gurus of you get liquidation and spend $1, get one back and it's like yeah there was a time I remember those days and there's some people who still have that. I mean the guy who funnel you know who you're wearing a shirt right now but there's a liquidating amazing and so uh that but that's like rare you know it's rare in some markets but you can do it but I mean I was talking you know me and Blake were chatting about how uh freaking Jeremy miners offer and like what that liquidation was at you know liquidating like 3.4 and doing 2 million plus a month. So uh don't worry too much about point4 was it? You said.3 point4. That's why if I'm remembering it right. Yeah. Yeah. Anik at his event just for some more sauce he says 50% needs to be above 50%. So in this case if you're doing your math and it's you're making 65 you're basically you have to keep your CPA under you know double that right is the simple math that uses and that includes backend stuff which it sounds like you have. So I just I don't know if you don't know your numbers on what your LTV is on the subscription. Uh where the subscription I assume this is where your subscription sits. So if you 12 people coming in at the subscription number I think the subscription stuff monarch is it the where's the front end in the subscription I don't see here no idea master class one time one time master class when I don't know where the subscription says subscription I think is O02 I don't know click on the OTO2 link that way yeah uh today no 197 okay all right so what's your stack right now we got 47 197. Okay, that that OV is not good. Then uh and then $47. Is this downell or is this another upsell to O02? And this one is 67. All right. So, it just seems like you got this kind of all out of whack. Oh, and now all of a sudden I got No, I just got hit with the thank you after I Yeah. Where the freak is your subscription, bro? And then you're getting them into a Kajjabi, which is not really I don't know what just happened. I don't know. All right. So, we got 47 Otto. We got I'm sorry, $47 uh initial offer. We got 197 is Otto1, which everyone is going to see. And then what happens if I say no? Same as this. Hold up. Downell 97. All right. And then ad library. He's running two ads. So that solves a lot of questions, too. In the nicest way possible. All right. So from the top down ad, you need to be testing so many more ads than this. That alone is going to get your CPA down. And you're saying you're trying to have a solve for AOV. And I don't know that that is your problem. Um it is def it is definitely something you can lift. So, quick thing on this. Uh, one, having this as, and Josh is gonna know this better than me, and since why I brought the sensei on here. Um, but this I would make two pages, not one. Uh, you don't have So, you have an order bump on here. Are people even taking it? Yeah, he didn't show us his order bump stats, which is I'm wondering about. He didn't drop it down, but Can you tell that? Where's the No, you just have to drop it down to see. 687. Oh, yeah. I guess you can. 212 $55. So you're getting some take rate. I'm not doing the math on that, but you have some take rate on this. You know, uh 55 bucks, whatever the math is. 55 divide by 47, whatever the lift. Okay. So, uh first things first, yeah, you could probably squeeze this by having a two-step, whether it's on one page or on two pages. And the numbers a lot of people will say is for this one step, which right here you have a 2%. You would have one before this and then one after this. So, you're collecting their name and their email, maybe their phone if you're actually utilizing phone. If you're not, don't do it. And then do name, email to have them start the process. They click next and they actually go to the order form. So you want whatever what's the numbers nowadays? 8 to 10% on the on OT on uh main sales page. Main sales. Yeah. Like people land on the sales page to buy. I'd say 8%'s good. Now, so 8% on step one, then when they go to the order form, and then you want Oh, sorry. That's blended. My bad. Blended. So I'd look at I don't even look at the in between until I see my blended. So, I just look at for people land on the front end to order with a two-step page. Are we at 8%. If not, then I go and I see, okay, what is my optin at? What is my order format? And that's why I see the drop off. Interesting. So, you have a blended 8%. Yeah, like that's why I normally when I'm doing my math, that's how I usually look at it. Yeah, we're lower than that. Um, okay. So, yeah, I mean I mean we've tested ones and whatever. So, 12 15%. Yeah, I think it's better just look at blended is easier. like if especially if he's not spending too much on like there's not a ton of scale on this yet on ads wise. So just look at your blended for now and as you start driving more volume then by blended again I mean number you're already doing it his blended is 2%. He's just looking at people land on his page people that buy but if you go to two step if people running two-step just blended optins and orders just how many people are converting from the front end and buying that product 8%'s really good um that's like really good. It used to be like 12% but now I just look at 8% as it's usually the highest I see it go. Uh and then you look at the drop off. So if you're not at 8% if as blended then you can see okay where's my optin at? Where's my order format? Like are people dropping off before they even get to the order form or are they dropping off at the order form? And then that's how you can start making better tip like ideas for how to CRO those pages. Yeah. So from the top down ads you need way more ads. Um way more. Also, those ads look like they're written by AI. Um, yeah, the ads create emojis. Like, no offense, but yeah. No, a little not offense, but yeah. So, 80% off plus 10 free bonuses. Okay. Like, no one really knows directly what this is. Um, but okay. So, you're getting here. So, on your stats on this, Josh is telling you to 4x your throughput. Uh, I'm saying split it into two to get your 4x throughput so you can see your drop off rate, which he was talking about. So make sure that you can start collecting because then you also have an op by flow that you can run. So you can run automations that are going to go to people that started the process but didn't complete it. That's the that's like the main point of that is the micro commitment of someone doing name email starting the process and you get that win and then you also get the data play people. So, in Josh's numbers, you're going to have 15%, let's say, that complete from sales page to order form and then you're going to have 50% that are going to complete the order form. And that's your blended number of seven and a half, 8%, whatever. So, on that, that's that's step one on this. Sorry, go ahead. Oh, sorry. Do you want I was going to say something about the upsell, but I want to if we're can look at this page up top down. Yeah. This many more of this. This a lot of love. This needs a lot. I mean, that's that No. Okay. So ugly things and not to call this ugly but like simple or whatever not crazy beautiful design work a lot of the time and a lot of time they work more so the very extreme example because it's easier to understand is if you had the ugliest page in the world where the buttons didn't even work but you had the best offer possible and all you had was your address on there people would be mailing you people would be calling you trying to buy your [ __ ] So your page how beautiful it is how well it works how whatever is not as important as what you're actually offering. you give the best offer in the world. Doesn't matter on the tech. With that being said, you still want your tech to be as good as possible. The design, all that kind of stuff. This is not optimized at all. I know what your viewers are, but like whereas look at this like Yeah. So, um, yeah. So, what I do here is go back to the top. So, just looking at this um like practical things that you can change. Again, these are little you're not you're One thing I'll add into you're it's not terrible. Again, you're complaining about your AOV and stuff. It's not terrible if you kept doing what you're doing. Okay, if this is really good on the back end, you'd make your money back. But again, I think the biggest lift, really good ads will just help a ton on the conversions on the front end. But then going to this page here, this trusted uh photographer like stars and stuff, I'd be put by the header like the black part there like at the top uh with a save there like have those proof indications uh there. Then to see how it works and get instant access. Are those two buttons like what the freak are those? Is that a headline or is wait click the Okay. What's it says yanks it straight to the order form on the bottom. Yeah. See, so it's like what the freak. So you're taking to remove that. Either go right to the order form or don't. Um but it'll go to the two-step there. So go back to the top again. So remove that. You're confusing people. Uh they're clicking on these random buttons. I can't tell what it is. And then the VSSL is like hidden further down. So you're not clicking play on that. So your clickthrough rate is probably pretty trash. So that needs to be way higher up. So, like where your proof is and where these buttons are, that's where your VSSL should be. Um, and also you have a button on scrolling down. You see the button right there? Claim special offer. It sticks to the page. So, you don't even need the buttons up top. So, that's just too many. It's all over the place. Um, not mobile friendly. It's taking up too much space on the page. Even if it is sticky, understand kind of what you got going on here, but like you have a CTA already on screen. So, have this one doesn't make sense. And this will like you want. And then and then what happens is you go into it. So, let's go back here. Let's think about the psychology of this. Scroll up a little more. So they see you made this claim, this offer. Here's how it works. The exact blueprint and then you hit stack. So you're just hitting a stack right here. What makes this different? Why do I need it? Who is it for? Like we didn't answer any of these questions. So on a low ticket funnel, that first section, I'm trying to explain what is this product? What is this product? Who is this product? What makes it different? Who is it for? What can you expect from it? Those are the the four things we're trying to hit. and as little copy as possible in the simplest dumb down version. So you didn't hit that. So you're this is not at all how it works. Yeah. So you're asking someone to buy and they know dude in all these creative bundles and templates bro there's so many out here. So in your market you really have to make it clear like why is it pro? Like what makes it better? What makes your like there's so many questions. So again saying this all with love and yeah I know it's whatever but you'll take it well. You're a marketer. You it's not the first time someone's roasted your funnels. Okay. featured in that could be higher up uh on the funnel. So you drag that further up under proof under the VSSL. So you have all these great feature things and like dude this could rip with this is truly the status you have. Then this can crush just little tweaks like that would be great. And then obviously me scroll a little more. Let me see if there's anything more egregious. I don't know. I don't like dark backgrounds. So I would try not to do dark background. I would try to have a different I love dark though. Just saying. But I know it's it's fine. People are it's whatever. Vault secrets. So you have you're just it's kind of just confusing. You're like, "Oh, you have this." So nowhere told me what makes this different, why it's good, why it's so amazing. I'm sure it's in your VSSL. So maybe you just need to pull some copy from your VSSL and put it in this. Are you not happy with your landscape or cityscapes you spent, bro? You need this energy in this page. Yeah. You have all the copy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Seriously, this time you spend all this time in all and you also already have your featured in right here. You just don't say that it's featured in and then you redo it down here which is not Yeah. Little tweaks you make here and there. Yeah. But this Yeah. You just need better. You need to take somebody's Here's a fun one. Show them freaking show them the blackbook funnel. No. Uh and No. Uh but you need to take Yeah, exactly. You need to take a funnel page like that. You need to literally I can find another one. You need to command A, command C, drop in the chat GBT, and command V and literally say, "Now build this around my offer. Ask me a million questions on what you need to know in order to structure this in this format. Give them the VSSL transcript. Do everything to chat GBT." and literally just model it around something like that as V1 of this if you're not going to pay someone to do it cuz either you pay someone this or you know how to do this but I don't not in a rude way but I don't know that you know how to do this in the right like I don't either personally let's be very clear here I'm not the person who's going to do this in the cleanest way. Can I click on this? Yeah, it's So this is just an example of a super stupid Dude, your links don't work on my internet at all. Uh it's probably Click I think Clickones 2.0 get flagged super easy on Wi-Fi. It's by your W. That's what happens on me, too. Yeah. Uh, I'll send a preview link, but there's this really simple frontend page that ripped for a a $47 product. Uh, I'll try to send another link. Let's see if this works. If not, I'll try to leave in the comments. You guys are watching say Josh or just look up this link. Just look offpublisher.comcontract. It's a duplicate so that you guys don't use my original link of a funnel template. Works super well. I can share my screen here. Let me share my screen. What are we What are we doing? Look at us. Okay. So, really fast and then we'll go on to the next one here or I'll talk upsells on his page. But, uh, so what it here, so it's just headline. Can you see? All right. Yep. We didn't use VSSL. This is for a Google Docs like a contract template. $47. Uh, we're at 5% of people landed on this page. And so, what we did is here's the copy. So, what you're missing is this, like the explanation of the problem, introducing the problem, what it does for them, what it makes it different. And so I just hit on painoint. So I made them problem aware. Uh and then I went into the product right away. So really short, really fast, fast on what it does. Click here to download. Then comparison. So you should have a comparison. So without your LUTs or your templates with it. So you have a comparison here. Uh and honestly, I probably would have made this green instead of blue. And then here's everything you get today. So now you can introduce your stack. My stack is so basic. Look how ugly this was. Just stupid little stars. Here's what you get. And then I had you get a bonus here. So this where you have like what's up? This was hitting your metrics. Yeah, dude. I mean I was at 5% $47 front end product and we had upsells and then we had back end. So we were fine. We were profitable on the front end. It's nice. Um cold traffic. No face. It there was a face on the back end. So it was technically a faceless offer. The we did add an like the one thing is we added an about you section. So about the creator. We had like the the person on there too. But uh then we had frequently asked questions and then you just put your testimonials. So again, this is just like a template um of a shorter version. So even something like that would probably do really well for your product because it at least brings it like problem, solution, whatever. So just wanted to share that quick so people have an example of what it looks like in a finished product. Um his upsell take rate is atrocious. Like yes, I mean yeah, let me go back. What was it 2%? Do you have two people that took it? You want to share your screen? Uh yeah, I was clicking around so now I'm lost but here we go. Um this is the atrocious numbers like ohund okay easiest thing you could do is just gate it. So easiest lift on an upsell is go to a gated VSSL meaning they get on the page and it says hey thanks welcome you just purchased it. Watch this quick video while we create your account. The video is a VSSL and then there's a timer saying your accountant details on lock in and there's a timer and then in that VSSL you introduce a new product because it gives you enough time to explain to them why upsell one makes sense. A lot of times people just say you just purchase the front end and boom there's a product right away and it's like freak dude like what did I just buy? Why doesn't it make sense? And especially for your market uh it may help because you're it looks like you're selling more of the same stuff or more templates, more L packs, whatever. And so you kind of have to it might be good to have that gated VSSL to explain what this product is and what makes it better. And so that alone will help with the lift because right now people are clicking off your page. Like you had 200 how many people purchase the front. Was it 212 or is that including the order bump? I forgot what 1.0 does. It's using 147 in my 147 reached it. Some people might be clicking off before then or Clickfunnels 1.0 some doesn't track it. So I can't really trust it. But right now a lot of people are just clicking off or hitting no. They're not hitting no thanks. Like look at the next page. 3% is your quick number and like that's that's that's no what's a good what's a let's just use some What are 20% on this and what about that jump? That's a what 4x jump 47 to 200. Yeah, that's fine. That's totally fine. I I do I've done 11 $1160 to $200 jump at 20%. So, I've done upsell two because this is this page right here is how they're currently hitting. So, it says, "Hold up, hot shot. Your order is not yet complete." However many of this 77% of people who see this offer say yes. Pretty sure that's illegal, brother. Uh, win 3%. But that's not my I think 2%. Um, instantly. We're not [ __ ] We're being kind. Uh, add 20. So, then this doesn't countdown expiration. Wait, why does this say 97 now? Did this because I said no to it, I think. Yeah. Ah, yeah. So, I said no to it and we're actually not [ __ ] on you. I promise. This is actually Yeah, sorry. I know. We kind We're having fun. Ryan and I just like to laugh and joke around. This is not you. Um, yeah. So, the initial one is 197. It's just not enough for one night. If you made that a lower price, like m if you dropped that to if it was a $97 product, maybe you get away with the bulletin. Oh, this is it. Okay. So then it drops into this section. Skybalt Otto. Oh, you should have a lot of these little Otto's. So like you're picking up Yeah. It's a supplement offer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're picking up a lot. Or not a lot, but you're picking up like Interesting. Okay. Yeah. So this needs So starting from the top again, more ads. This piece needs I would split this into two so you get a better uh take on this. Uh I would then you know do everything that Josh was saying both on the technical framing standpoint but the pricing is fine. The offer itself might need some love. Yeah need like what is this different? What like what it doesn't make sense really what it is. I'm sure it's in the VSSL. The funny thing is it's probably in the VSSL. You just need to gate it. Gate the VSSL and then drop the pop down or write it out. Like keep you can literally keep all the same. Just gate it so it doesn't appear until 8 minutes in or seven minutes into the video. just try that first. It looks like what you're doing is basically you're taking all of them. You're you're creating what you're trying to do is say here's your ultimate shortcut. Here's everything in one and I'm going to give you the sky vault. I'm going to give you the fog. I'm going to give you the flare, the rays. I thought the front end was the ultimate. Why do they need the ultimate thing though? I thought, you know, so you kind of have to explain framing through this is because this one is teaching them Adobe Creative Cloud bundle which I also would I don't understand the difference but I'm not in the market. Yeah. This one you're getting camera techniques blueprint. So this is all about shooting. Ah, and editing. How to shoot and that's how to edit which doesn't really make sense for Adobe Creative Cloud bundle if that's the name of it because that's editing. Yeah. Creative Cloud Master Class. You're teaching them how to edit but then your framing is teaching them how to shoot which is different. I understand the value of where you're going is like you got to shoot it and why the settings and all this kind of stuff first. Then once you solve that it's like oh here's how you edit them. Amazing. Even if you do [ __ ] up the shooting and do whatever all templates do it faster and then you're saying when someone says no you're pushing them to the just one of these the sky vault I'm pretty sure but you talk having the sky vault and everything included in here or is your vault and all your secrets yeah there's a lot of confusion he's got to simplify it yeah vault bonus the vault secret vault secret like you're already including that so that's why these take rates aren't in here is the flow doesn't make enough sense where their brains Literally like what you need to sit down is you need to go into notes and you need to type out front end order bump upsell one upsell two and you need to be super clear one sentence the outcome each thing is getting them and then start from there like right now I don't think you know so it should be like either it's how front end how to shoot order bump you know I don't know what the freak next be a micro objection of that like poses or whatever the freak while you're shooting for the people then upsell one is it how to edit is that what you're teaching them how to edit and then is downell just a discount of the same product like you just need to do how to how to and then you can add in all the bonuses to make it really clear because I feel like some people confuse that or some people here you could do the front end where it's like teaching a model so here's how to do everything and then the upsells are here's how to do steps and the everything faster. So those are like the two different ways you can do it with there's actually three ways to low offer. There's models which teach them the whole model. There's milestones. So milestone to get your first client or your first photography gig or you know whatever your first portfolio book and then there's tools. So that tools will be lots templates whatever. So you can mix it up on the front end there. But I think I think that's good for this. That's a lot for him to work on that. That's a like Yeah. And I'm still confused on where this recurring is because your math actually might be crushing if somehow you're doing uh photography coaching the same price recurring because if you have Oops. if you have x amount of time that you know already data on this that the average person stays for three or four or five months. If it's you know four months you're making $200 on them and it's costing you $100. Like don't get me wrong that's not great but you're not losing money. Um and the real goal I would assume is to ascend them into these. So we're we're going to move on to the next one. But the last thing on this is this portion right here. Your live workshopping. I mean if you nail this then everything else is gravy. So, but these you could build this out to not focus on AOV and confusion and hard to do and whatever. And you could focus it on ascension. That's what we do. I have videos where we talk about this. But instead of on these OO pages, you can book them in with a setter and then have a setter talk to them, qualify them, push them to a closer, and you could sell this $7,500 thing depending on how this targeting is and what quality of people are coming into here. But same thing, it doesn't matter if it's a direct to cart or if it's a over the phone or whatever. the logic and framing of the offers have to make sense. If you're scaling, if you're getting a bunch of people into here to learn how to change their camera settings and have plug-and-play systems and then over here it's like, "Hey, I'm going to teach you how to shoot and have plug-and-play systems for $7,500." Now, like that doesn't make sense. They thought they already got that. They already paid for that. So, like I don't know the natural logical ascension, but assuming that your 7.5K thing offers this, which is a live workshop, so it's an inerson version. Let's say one back, this 2K one, Institute of Photography. I don't know how that's different or how that logically would make sense, but you can sell that then and know that 5% of your people, let's do some math for you. Let's say 5% of your people come through here right now. You're losing, let's call it 40 bucks for easy math. If you have 40 bucks and you have 5% of them ascending, it's going to it's going to cost you $800 to acquire a $2,000 customer and then you pick up another 2x on the back. And if you get this and dial this in, then you're going to be profitable in the front end and have no cost on the back. So you're gonna get 2K for every single one of these. So that's the initial play in my mind. Let's move on to these next ones. Um yeah, I can share my screen. All right. I have his ones, too. Oh, sure. Yeah, hit that first, then I have mine after. Low code app developer. Price point 5 to 15 pay. Ship fat. He's sending it to this 6x rorowaz. But he can't scale his ad budget because he has too many unqualified. First of all, brother, yes, you can scale your ad budget if you have a six. Wait, he's six. He's six. What's gone? What does he means? I think this might just be one of those, hey, high ticket. Look at my stuff and get other people on here. Um, respect game. Respect game. Um, 6x rorowaz. So, you have too much unqualified and what is this? Any closed widget? Yes. So, uh, this is why you have too many unqualified because you're not asking them anything. You need to qualify them. Also, he's not call Wait, is he calling his ideal app? Like, what do you mean qualify? Aren't speaking to them? I see. I don't know how the ads look and I don't really want to go through ad manager and try and find them. But yeah, also he's not speaking to it's like, well, if you want to qualify people, you need to draw them and speak to them. Or like you're most likely an entrepreneur in mind. You're most likely. So, it's a business. He's trying to target entrepreneurs that want to start a software and he's going to basically teach them either how to do it or do it for them. He's gonna He should have told us what is qualified or not because we can actually point out what's attracting and qualified, but he didn't really say that. Yeah. So, that's all you need to do. That is very simple. First of all, 6x, you're fine. Uh, and you probably have backend money and recurring stuff. I think he's flexing. Just kidding. I respect it. Honestly, I respected. Yeah. Honestly, that's how you do it on X, dude. Shout out to your winning, bro. Keep crushing it. Keep spend more. What's going on? Like, is your sales team capping you out? is like what's like he's probably ramping because I was talking to Josh Troy yesterday and there's so many other things we want to track and he's talking about how like activity models too like you ramp you're ramping expense you hire more closers but then for the next first 30 to 60 days your new closers and setters are going to perform lower than the other new the current people and it's like there could be so many things so many things he's Josh Troy tracks things so well and that's why yeah shout Josh Troy I'm excited to post that interview all right so this is a threeminute video so that also helps you on you have no consumption that can that can possibly occur. Not to say you need it, but like if you feel like people are not cons are not your ideal client, you have unqualified people and they don't feel like you don't feel like they're warm enough, it's because you have you don't call them out, you don't put it in the VSSL that is 3 minutes long and you have no questions on your booking widget in order to do so. I don't know what this is. Oh, it's cal.com. So, there's other ones like this, but I would I mean, all these are going to offer the same thing. I closed is kind of cool because it makes them answer the questions before so you get the people who drop off who don't end up booking but start the process if you're looking for like a one in allin-one tool that's easier. Um this is yeah you need to just frame this better. Well I don't know what qualify by but like do they over 10k a month or 100k a month or whatever number like ask them that then. And like what is their target size? What is their current client load if you're trying to build it for in-house software? or if this is a standalone like I don't know what you're trying to build but this one's pretty easy also you could test you're doing he's kind of doing direct application here but he's not gating it so I don't know you might want to gate it you know speak to your people make sure that people actually watch it they know who it's for they they might just land lay on the page and I believe book they haven't consumed anything they want to get it over with it's like I do the same thing where I go to certain sites or send me information like fill it out I'm going to wait for a call and I forget what I was even on and it's like force it. So yeah, and then have all your stuff warm. This guy has all his too many qualified leads. What if it's 6S Roz and it's only like one sale. I know. That's the other thing. What? I don't know how much traffic. I don't know. No idea. I know. And I didn't ask questions. So that's on me. That's all good. Thanks for sharing, brother. Best of luck. Get your VSSL. Do what we said. Let us know how it goes. Drop another thread on this or comment on this so we down to do these again. I I want to start doing these. I just need like I need to standardize what data and maybe you already have it on your form but like what you collect. Yeah, I have um I rush the form but I have a better one. Like ideally we'll ask people for the whole funnel and like we can just my consults I have like a six third I think it's like 35 60 when I do oneoff I have so many questions super long tight forms. So if you really want they can answer a bunch of questions but all right this one's a fun one and then we can drop into your forms. We got 24 minutes. Um, offer building infrastructure and development of digital robots that test applications autonomously for large B2B companies. Wait, digital robots. Yeah, like AI agents I see. Yeah, it's like Wait, wait, wait. Hey, it's all Don't you Hey, you don't need to use unique mechanism for us. We know what it is. Magnet redirecting to sales page. Oh, shoot, bro. I can't got you got translate. There's an English button. Okay. Oh, interesting. Very like just website. Where's the sales page? This is the sales page. Oh, whoa. Oh. Oh, gosh. Okay. Um, and then is there English? What is this? And then this is their onboarding ROI calculation. No, these are not then in English. My little overlay thing is not working. So, yeah. Where's it? Um, it's an orc. I don't know. I don't know. I don't speak this is I got that one. Maybe just skipped. I don't know. Savings of this. What's number two? Superior. Okay, now I I read that. Trying to get to the end. 50%. I want it, dude. So, you can download the report or you can do this, which is what what does it mean? I just circulated. I don't know. This is probably not helpful for anybody for drop us let us know in the comment. Yeah, it's not helpful. All right. predicting a AO ob for my business is 80,000 and cost to acquire a customer is 4,000. I I spent funnel has been running for 3 weeks and results are low. We only have one booked call. Okay. Uh I know the design and flow could be better. Correct. I'm still testing and trying to understand but though I said how many customers have you acquired at 4K because if you're getting a 20x rorowaz I don't understand the problem. And it said three customers were before the funnel and CAC was almost non-existent as it was just word of mouth. Oh, is my benchmark that I'm paying on LinkedIn ads for the funnel stack. Oh, my LinkedIn goblin respect. Okay. So, yeah. No, you just need to make this more I mean depending on what game or direct respons I guess. I don't know. Exactly. Literally exactly gonna say I was like this is just not like if that's what your goal is is to just like have know your numbers dialed like that. You can do that through a lot of things but direct response if that's what you're trying to do here. ROI calculator is what that is at the end. Uh, I clicked around and like again I don't speak the language in here, but like I don't even see where I can book a call. I just clicked this and it brought me back to this. So like can they even book a call in your calculator? Like look at this. I just continue through. Continued through. Yes. Where's where do I book my call? Where's my calendar? Yeah. And again, I'm not literally can't speak the language, but like what does this one do? That one brings you back to so I can download a report and then do that. But yeah, you want to you just need to position this. I mean I like it, right? He probably custom built this and I bet this works. I bet people run through this and you can see all your stats on this. But yeah, I mean you want to you want to dial that in. But you have a lot of room depending on how much you want to test and burn some cash to test because you have a lot of room. So yeah, I don't have a ton of advice for you. I mean LinkedIn ads if they work cool but LinkedIn ads are just another traffic source. Same as meta, same as partnerships, same just have to expect different based on the warmth and the XYZ. Um, so yeah. So I would respond to this a little bit more and then you ready? Thanks for sharing. Thanks for sharing whoever that was. Thanks for sharing. Thanks for sharing with us. Okay, let me share my right screen. Um, okay. So what do we know about this offer? Not a ton of data. One thing I didn't ask for is a screenshot of our page, but um, right now, wait, which link would I click on? Communication for only $448 spent. So, right away I'm like, not enough money to to tell too much, but we did get um 489 link clicks. So, decent. We can guess make some suggestions how to improve it. Cost per result was $23, which I'm assuming that's your CPA. Um, which is what I asked for. So, uh, but he spent $448 and made back $23.60. Okay, so he Never mind. That's not a CPA. That was how much money he made back. Um, cost per click is super low. Really low. I'm wondering you're you're right away. I mean, let me see your ads. Yeah, I was going to say even running. Super curiositydriven like Okay, here's his here's his copy. So, I guess it's not terrible. Okay, so it's marriage niche. Yep. Yeah. Sorry, I should have shown you. I don't know either. So marriage niche. So it's direct sale which your cost per click I don't know if you're running it to like what the Latin market or freaking like those are it's really cheap cost per click and these aren't like these are direct offer. So that makes me a little a little more happy because some people be running ads are super curiosity and there's no like people are just clicking because they think it's like a blog post but this is direct to sale which is great. So, I mean, hey, I'll take that. Um, I wouldn't change much there. It's just your page then. That's freaked up because you can see his CT all is 10%. CPM. So, that's what we know about this. What's the Can you scroll on that page a little bit on his page? On this one. Yeah. Yeah. So in here, I already know a few things, but I would say okay, just going down start to finish. I don't This is I know what the template this is from. Shout out to Legend Allen. Great template. It's amazing. Uh this is also a mini AC template, which is a made up of my version of the AC, which is a mini one. So great template. Nothing against it. But the headline, this was like worked really well back then and a lot of people do it. But I wouldn't say like a new book reveals a counterintuitive way to like you spent so much time just teeing it up. Like get to the outcome like get to here like some of my best things like see how I or see how we did this or learn how to do this and get this outcome. Keep it very simple. I would just take out this and at least go to like new way to deepen your connection. And like even just that is better than just all this stuff in between here. So I would change that. Um this is fine. I guess logo I can't read that's tiny things and this new way creating unbreakable bond with your partner has nothing to do with I would just go into without class direct response without therapy. Unrealistic advice is what is the unrealistic advice like yeah where what is what's the advice? Get specific. Therapy is a good one. So you knock that um because that's expensive. It takes a lot of time. What? Think about what are all the other things people hate doing to try to get the outcome and just do without without without. Did you get any funnel stats on this? Nope. Well, not funnel stats. We Well, he got one. I think he said he had one purchase. He spent $400 and got one purchase or sorry, not one purchase. He got I don't know what the order bumps were, but he made $23 after spending. So again, like I said at the start, it's not a lot of sub page and go to the thing to the actual buy box or whatever. Oh yeah, let's see what his freaking order bump is. Oh man, this is what we were talking about on the first one is having a two-step like this. Colors are all over the place. You make your color scheme. Okay, so he's got an order bump, which is how much money is this? $15. Why isn't it popping up when I clicked it? Oh, here it is. Okay. $15. So, what did he get? Two. If you got 20, what? Maybe max three sales. Yeah, exactly. So, order. This is good though. Like, you did it right. Like, this is fine. I think your colors make it a little more congruent. Um, bring this up here. Like I bring this up to the top usually. Get into access mockup, then order form, and then the rest of it. Have some testimonials on the bottom here if you want. But yeah, not a ton of data, dude. We're just giving you like as you scale and improve, these are things you can come back to later. Um, what do you think about that plug your ebook language? What's up? What do you think about the download your ebook is the CTA? Yeah, me too. Don't do that. Again, it's a template starting place and that's why templates evolve on them. So, just say like uh rekindle your marriage or get like whatever today arrows pointing to the right. Yeah. And in that headline like test these, right? Like test this. But like I didn't know that this was relationship even after looking at it like narrative like communication. I thought it was business that like I took it like when I saw even like the domain I was like is this business and then this needs to be centered on the page. What is the six week? Okay. Too long, bro. Too long. Six weeks. I need it like obviously there's milestones in this six week that you should sell. So, I'm not saying lie and be like get your intimacy back in a week. You can't do that. But is there a milestone in this that's 14 days or 28 days and lead with that. It should be like a protocol. If you go to strategic parenting.com, uh they do the best at this. This is where I get like my idea for like protocols and lifestyle changes. Um they do this thing where all their courses are like 28 day to no yelling parenting challenge. 18-day break your like it's so clear. Like Ryan, when you look at this, it's like what's going to happen in 18 days? Yeah, if you follow it, you're going to freaking break your kids screen addiction. Screaming. Yeah, these are very specific. Who? You know who this is? strategic parenting.com. And yeah, I do. Like you know the actual people and they run all these indiv. Someone published them. I'm pretty sure I know I know people on the team because they've hired big corporate like there's a whole team now, CMOS and it's one of the biggest parenting offers going to say and they run all those individually as direct response. Yeah. Catalog model and have upsells, downells. Yeah. So this should be like a 28 day or 18 day thing. So you need to change that because six week dude you get the page six weeks bro I'm out too long. Get them in like bring them into the funnel. So the six week communication is a fix. Like what and then counter to again we're stuck in the template. Got to break free. Um space this out. This needs to be space in between each of these. Only a few days left. Not true. That's not compliant. Just say download now and get instant access or rekindle your relationship in 14 days, whatever. Um, only $5. Remove these two zeros with a dot. This needs to be deleted. Just make it five. And then it's fine. Down here where it says for 67, add the dot and the two zeros so it looks bigger. Make remove the two dots here. Remove this arrow. Remove this. It just looks janky on the go high level form. Change this from goes to step two to, you know, download now and get instant access or get rekindle your marriage. Add a refund badge. [Music] I tried everything I could. See, I love the template still, right? Like the template stands true. Yeah, but it's like what's in it? It's that's it. Like look at the six week communication the easy way. Study for six weeks. Just kidding. Study six weeks and nah, bro. That's not the easy way. I'm going to a counselor. I'm just going to tell them to tell me what to do. Like your way looks way harder. So this is a lot of your narrative, your framing, your messaging. It's just off and we need to come back have a protocol 14 days, 28 days to just like rekindling like something like there's milestones in those six weeks. How can you sell them on that first milestone just to get things going because these people are like dude in their marriage things are going they're bad. They're made on the brink of divorce. They're it's really tough like they're at the wits end. Usually it's people who are buying. So and then also it's like your communication sucks. for someone to buy this, they are having to agree that their communication sucks, which it admits that like they're wrong. And so you need to scapegoat something else. You need to scapegoat. Like your product should not be named this. I didn't see that. That's like the biggest red flag. Um I'm Dude, you you want this book sitting on my freaking like I'm saying let's say a physical book. You want me to buy this at Barnes & Noble, go to the counter and just purchase this in front of somebody? I'm clearly admitting the world my communication sucks. like they got to think about these kind of things too. Um, and so you got to make it an attractive uh I I came with this offer today, Ryan, on our our call inside of Offer Publisher. Someone was like, "Josh, you should do an offer for marriage and like being two years married." I'm like, "Dude, if I did it, I call it like the never- ending honeymoon or something." Or it's like people say the honeymoon only lasts six months to a year. I aim for the Yeah. the good. How do you extend it? Right. So, you got to make it like super cool, like a positive outcome, not your communication sucks. So, someone's going to steal it off or never-endingh honeymoon.com or like I thought when I was a kid called How to Date Your Wife or Your Spouse. It's like most times like people forget they don't know how to date their wife. So, it's like 14 days like like that be like a bunch of dates you can do. How to bring back the intimacy, the spice, whatever. So, see how that's way more attractive than your communication sucks. Yeah. No, I feel like that's some actionable stuff right there on that one. Yeah, we're done there. That one's good. We're done. Okay, let's see this next one. Yeah, go ahead. Um, CEO cleaning accelerator. So, it's a cleaning bizop CPA on live workshop $15. Biggest bottleneck is essentially the group coaching. Oh, let's go. Let me see it. I wish I had Do we have stats? CPA $30. CPA live workshop. Okay, sounds like it's fine. Let me try. I don't want to like show the links if I can. people will find either way. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Public companies don't hide it. Think bigger. Yeah. What the That's a Thank you. Try this link. Oops. Okay. That's a cool little tool, by the way. What's that called? That you look at the uh mobile simulator. That's very cool. I was wondering how you're doing that. Okay. Um Okay. Oh, wow. Um logo make it transparent. Yeah, unless it's survive recording session recorded. I don't know if I'd really need to say that, but yes, I want immediate access. What is it? Page is not the most beautiful FI, but uh full name, email, phone, $27 for the recording of a master class. I would change how you're wording that to recording, but you're making you're from 97 to $124 and you have a CPA of 30 bucks. Is that right? Yeah. Or CPA on Evergreen workshop $30. Okay. So, we're not going to touch this uh or this part of it. So, this works for you. Um this that's good. And what you're saying your issue is is your ascension. So, you're making on the front end. We know somebody that does this very well that makes 3x on the front. um and then is also trying to build you know info coaching on the back which is more so the coaching piece. So there there it is. Is this I think this comes after they purchase. I'm pretty sure bottom of that page. What's that demo call button? Oh yeah. Um schedule demo call. This goes to another page. Yeah demo. First of all big difference in my mind immediately is you're talking about what was it? $650 a day was the initial. Oh, yeah. Let me see. Yeah. So then then you jump to let's do 20k months. Like how are those different? I don't even like off the top of my head I'm like okay what is the first one? 15 grand or 20 grand and then you're talking about I think it's like we need to get to the out like $650 a day faster. Like my in bisop it's always like templates done for you stuff like that. The outcome are we normally selling because Yeah. And and what you can do with that framing is instead of trying to ascend them directly, you don't have to frame it as ascension. You don't have to say, "Oh, cool. Now that you just bought the thing to get to $650 days, hey, do you want to get to 20K days?" They don't even know how to get to 650 yet. So, what you do want to do or what you can do is instead of trying to sell the next thing is just help them implement. And that is so people will do a quick start call. They'll do an implementation call. Just change the framing of this page to say you've been upgraded to the whatever version of this which comes with a call, a quick start call. And then book them in a call that's not with you. It's not with the closer ideally. I mean it can be if you guys are small. I don't know how where you're at, but like a hybrid closer or a setter and have them talk to the person and guide it and be like, "Oh, cool. Amazing. Yep. You got your access. You got your login. Okay, cool. Here's what's included. and by the way, why didn't you apply for our remote cleaning accelerator? And they're like, "Oh, what do you mean? Like I just saw an ad for this and I just bought this." And it's like, "Oh, no. Well, like all the success stories you're seeing on the site, that's where they come from." And all of our best case studies are from that because they get one-on-one personalization and they get, "You're sharing your screen." Okay. I know. I didn't know. I didn't know. And I'm not an editor. So, uh, but they go, "Yeah." So they basically the ascension is from that is from getting them on the phone talking about how you have this other program this better program that's for them because of this because of this and going from there. What is this? Trying to find an example of one of these bookall pages I thought was good. My swipes Oh yeah this this one. Yep. So book your on. So these guys call an onboarding call. I was talking about as an implementation, a quick start or whatever. And all you're going to do is frame like this. So it is yeah your login access are right there. Although the information is valuable. We found it's helpful to have you know that people have issues implementing it. So being like ah it can kind of can be hard. So like you just booked this call in. We'll walk you right through it. Our experts will walk through it and they'll give you some other personalized this and this. And the personalization is like oh I do think you're a good fit actually for our backend thing. If they are that's the other thing. If your ascension rates ass, it may be because you're selling some low ticket thing that's not in alignment with your back end, which is so common. Or someone sells something that's how to do XYZ, think extremes, and you know, selling them something on dog training and then your backend on the back is teaching them how to get fit. It's like that doesn't make sense. But that can happen within your niche and in your micro, too. So, I don't know that that's the easiest way to collapse your ascension timeline is to build it into the funnel. The other way is to do it through um activation points inside your community program, whatever that after they do x amount of days or x amount of actions or are inside the community and whatever they're, you know, raising their hand basically to CTAs, you can pull them out, get them on the phone with a set of closer that way. So that's my thought on that. But your CPA is solid and your return. Yeah, I think long term if you scale into colder markets, your front end's not if you're selling on Bistops 0 to one, become a cleaning business. There's a lot more lift you need to do to convince someone that they believe they can do it. It's easy, it's simple, there's no startup cost. Like there's a lot more lift you're going to have to do than just this little page. But um Facebook's definitely giving you like it'll give you the best people at the start. I know this person has organic audience and all that. So just know eventually you'll have to build a funnel for the people in the problem state but right now it's obviously hitting on people who are already convinced on cleaning or whatever because you don't really get them problem aware solution aware mechanism. So just know that's in your near future but I'm always down to start with MVP to validate stuff and make it different later on. Yeah. Do you have any other ones on four minutes? What's up? Do you have any other ones? Yeah. Yeah. We got uh Okay, I got one. Structure these better into the future because I like these. I think these are helpful and I already got some ideas too for our stuff which is interesting. Yes sir. Easy. Okay, so we have product type. Okay, this is Zach. We met Zach at the event in Dallas. Shout out Zach. Um bottleneck probably too much text. Here is stats 1.5 link CTR. Uh current cost per lead is purchase about $2 or after. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. Okay, so he has 3.5%. Oh, sorry. up here. 24% optin. Let's just see what this is. Those stats look good. Oh, hey. I know this guy. Yeah. Sean, Zach. Oh my gosh. Make that page prettier. Did he say too much text? Yeah. 24% optin rate. Cool. And then Oh, he's talking about the sales page. Can you go to sales page? Oh, yeah. Oh, that could be an issue. I've been there, brother. Let me see if I popped with this. If it goes to Hey, here we go. Okay, he sent us wrong link. He's big on keeping things simple and I know like ugly. Yeah. All right. So, what's his issue on this? He said, let's double check. Um, probably way too much. Not having enough authority backed into it. So, but what are the other stats? So, if you go back to the second column, current costs. Yeah. One more over. He was saying 3.5% of sales page on That's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Oh, no. That's the blended number. or I get what he's saying. Yeah. So, his lead cost is 2%. Or I'm sorry, it's $2. Mhm. And then divided by 00357. So, it's costing him $56 to get a purchase on that page. Is that my understanding? If it cost $2 to land someone on that page, right? Current cost after purchase. I don't understand what you're saying to be honest. Yeah. I don't that's from that page. What's the offer on the bottom of that page? This one. Yeah. $47. Or it's $23.50 a month. So, it's half off if you decide to do a monthly recurring. Yeah. That's framed kind of funky. Yeah. I mean, simple stuff that we said on the other ones, but yeah, there's no CTAs throughout that, which is you need way more probably or at least images, too. Like big TSLs, you definitely need images. I get it. And he's trying to be a 50% new member, which is for the monthly, but I got to pop off this in 40 seconds. But, um, yeah, you need more stats around these. This is fun. Don't use go hell basic text, too. It's ugly. More images. Uh, timer's broken. Um, and give us your other stats and we'll review it again and see see what else we can do. Good stuff. Rock on, bro. There. We'll do this again someday. Send us your funnels. I like the hoodie, by the way. This hoodie. Yeah. Swagged up. Appreciate it, dog. Shout out my wife. Shout out Mark. Yeah, Mark. Where's mine? Exactly. Exactly. Gotta be jacked. She All right, guys. That is day 88. I'll upload this one today, I think. thinking I'm doing another phase two. Phase two is coming. Phase two of 12 days. I'm ready. I'm excited, dude. Keep crushing. Keep cooking. I got to tell you some sauce. I got something good. Good. Good. All right. Talk to you soon. Peace.
