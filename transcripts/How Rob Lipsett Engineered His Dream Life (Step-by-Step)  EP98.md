## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PJfDF1yRjU

What's up, guys? We've got a banger today. We've got Rob Lip Set. We're on day 98 in a row of doing these. Rob, kick it off. Who are you? Everyone knows who you are, but just tell the people. Maybe in the fitness industry, but in this uh in your space, probably not. So, it's tough to describe myself. Uh I guess at this stage, I'm an online fitness entrepreneur. I'm a YouTuber as well. I say that proudly because YouTube we're going to go in on today. It's this magical platform and everything I do really revolves around fitness. So that's my expertise. But now at this stage of my life, it's gone into, you know, business, doing events, a little bit of everything. Some e-commerce, some physical products. I do it all. But it all comes back to building bigger biceps. So that that is Yeah, that's pretty much what I do. I've been uploading to YouTube 10 for 10 years. I was Ireland's first ever Yeah. 10 years. Ireland's first ever fitness YouTuber and so I can I can say that proudly. So I saw other guys in like America doing this, UK doing it and I'm like no one in Ireland is doing this so I'm going to be first to market. And it was the best decision I've ever made in my entire life. That's why like out of everything I do like you know every business and income and every every project that I do I always say I'm a YouTuber because that without that without that initial thing that I did I I'd be nothing. So I owe it all to that moment that I decided to pick up a camera and start documenting my fitness journey talking about myths and kind of things that like people get wrong online. shown myself doing bicep curls in the gym, which I got a slagging for at the beginning, but that was like the most important decision I ever made in my life. So, when I saw you on Twitter putting in all this effort on YouTube, I was like, "Yes, I was love to see it." So, thank you so much for having me on, Ryan. And that's a little little brief intro on what I do. Yeah. No, it's so funny. So, I probably I'm trying to think the initial I had like 80 people maybe on X and when I started doing YouTube and I was like I talked to Iman in the beginning and he was like, "Yeah, just get to 3 to 5K on X. Get to 3 to 5K on YouTube within your like honeypot of people who basically make at least like 3 to 500K a month online in some capacity. Um, mainly info coaching." And so I just kind of leaned in that direction. I tried to do stuff on X and it was just I'm talking like two impressions, like four impressions on anything I would post. And I was like, "Dude, like, [ __ ] this." I literally was like, "Fuck this." Like, "I'm not doing this." I'm like posting like we're doing like 90k a day and I'm like posted a screenshot. It's getting like three engagements. I'm like, "Dude, I did something wrong." So, but your stuff kept popping up on my like recommended whatever that the main feed is. So, I followed you and then you were posting like what car you're going to get and all this stuff. And you have like a lot of the aesthetic like cool stuff that does, you know, there's like money Twitter version of that. There's like fitness Twitter that does that and your stuff would always pop up. So, I was like, you know, one of 60 people I followed at the time. uh was you and it's so funny. Um girlfriend I'm like talking. She's like, "Oh my god, like how do you know who that is?" I'm like, "I don't know. Just follow him on X." And like when you started responding to stuff in some of my first videos, she's like, "Oh my god, I used to watch him like 10 years ago." I was like world like how everything all connects into this. But seriously, OG, dude. She's a major OG. But yeah, you go back and and and Zoom 10 years like what was that what was that evolution like? I mean, usually these, just FYI, so it I mean, yes, it gets kind of like the broad scope, but like the main target of this is people doing a couple hundred grand a month, generally speaking, info coaching. It's kind of like finding little nuggets of pieces that are over here in this part of the online space. There's like agency, SAS, info coaching, like all these different pieces and like we just try and kind of pull from all of them and like see what are people crushing in YouTube organic that goes to like you said, info coaching, supplements, what? So, like what was the 10-year like grind or like monetization grind? Oh, for sure. So, my my first few videos got like a couple hundred views. And so, my biggest piece of advice for someone starting out on YouTube or X or whatever, put your blinkers on and don't look around you. Don't look at the people doing one million views or like tens of thousands of views. You're going to get discouraged and it's going to ruin the whole enjoyment for it. It's going to like ruin the whole It's going to take the fun out of it if you start comparing yourself to other people. And I think I actually made this quote. It's it's people people have put my name beside this quote anyways. Okay? I don't know if I if I've like trademarked it, but don't compare your chapter one to someone else's chapter 10. And that applies to the gym. If you're in your first year lifting and you're looking at someone who's been there for 10 years and you get discouraged about the numbers you're putting up or your physique, it's going to ruin the whole thing for you. If you're looking at year one in business and you're looking at these people who are in year 10, you're just going to be like, "What am I doing?" It applies to social media. It applies to everything. And that is one thing I didn't do. I didn't compare myself to anyone at the beginning. I got my my 500 views on her first video and I was like, "Yes, what the hell?" I was like, "Let's go. I cannot believe this." And that like gave me the motivation to always keep going. And I swear on my life. So, I'm about to hit like 500K on YouTube. And my first one when I got my first thousand subs, I I'm h I was happier. I'm going to be happier than when I hit the 500K because for me, it was such a big deal. And I recommend anyone who's just starting on on their journey. Never lose that that curiosity and and that humility. You know, it's going to make the journey so much more fun if every step of the way you're just like, "Fuck yeah." Yeah, you know, when you're hitting these little milestones, be it like, you know, numbers in business or or views, whatever, just keep that childlike that childlike fun towards life, and you're going to go a long way. And that's how I don't I don't get burnt out, you know? And that's how I stay consistent. I'm the most consistent [ __ ] in the game. 10 years, I'm still here, still going. The reason I do that is I keep that humility and I keep that that fun in me. Yeah. No, I love that. So like, so 10 years ago, you're in Ireland, right? You're working a job and then YouTube starts to do its thing and YouTube, you know, 500 views, you're making 12 cents and like pick up and I was like, see a boss, I'm out of Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Yeah. No. Um, so like what So what was the what was the plan? It was just keep doing that. You're probably doing Were you working in fitness and then Okay. So So th this is where it started for me. I was working at a desk job 9 to5. It was actually 9 to6 which was like killer. Like that extra hour. Oh man, man. I was like that last hour dragged on. And then I get out of work in Dublin traffic, get home and like settled at about 700 p.m. you know, say hi to my family, make my way to the gym for 8:00 p.m. And it's it's pitch black in Ireland at 4 p.m. Like it's pitch black. And so I wouldn't see sunlight. I'd have this shitty gym session. Couldn't even take pre-workout or I wouldn't sleep that night. Oh yeah. Finish up in the gym at like 9:30 and then from 9:30 to 2:30 or 9 to 2 in the morning, I'd be working on online coaching. I'd be planning YouTube videos. I'd be recording YouTube videos. I had a [ __ ] box light. So, so you couldn't tell. It was pitch black. I'd be planning them, scheduling them, everything. Just I was trying to be an online fitness coach, online fitness YouTuber. I'd be doing that till 2 a.m. And then I get a shitty 4hour sleep up at 6:00 a.m. to get ready for work. following day doing it. And I did that for over well over six months. Uh and that was like that was a grind, man. Like that was I was like there has to be more to life. I can't be doing this 9 to5 [ __ ] I need to figure out a way that I can make my passion which is fitness. I can make that a living and that I can run my own schedule. And that's what I always go back to is freedom and just being able to do my own schedule. After you get to a certain point, you've probably seen this before, a certain point in how much money you make, h your lifestyle or your day-to-day schedule doesn't really change that much. So, like if I can wake up, you know, wake up whenever, wake up in the morning, I'll do like fulfilling work, focused work, creative work that I'm really excited to do. I'll do that for about four or five hours. Then I'll go hit the gym and then I'll go jump in the sea in Marba. You know, me and my wife, we'll get a nice lunch. Then I'll do some halfass work that doesn't require much brain power. and I'll clock off at like, you know, five or six. As long as I can do that every day, I'm a rich rich man. So, I just wanted to get to that point uh with my my lifestyle. So, that's what I always anchored back to. But, so within about six months of doing the whole online thing, I was able to quit my job and it wasn't a big like [ __ ] you to the boss. I I was 22. I was 22 at the time. And so, I went in and I was like, "Hey boss, look, I'm doing this fitness coaching thing on the side. Uh, I've made three grand this month month, which at minimum wage in Ireland at the time was like two grand. So I was like, I've done that consecutively for for three months, so I'm going to like go all in on this. And he was totally cool down. And he was like, Rob, you're doing [ __ ] nothing in the office anyways. He was like, get get the hell out of here. And so I did that. And once you put 100% into something, it just just skyrockets. like I had all this energy and all this time in the day to finally go all in on what I wanted to do. And like so that was the first six months and then the next six months were like I'm I'm re I'm close to living my dream life. So I'll never forget that year. I was 22 at the time and that was the year I believe my life started. Like I feel like just everything up until then I was just figuring things out and you see all these these kids nowadays and they're like they're 17 18 and they're like running these cra they're making crazy numbers online and they think they're late. I'm like fellas I only figured things out. I only got started at 22. So that's the that's the day the the date and age that I feel my life began. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. I mean I just restarted a new season and I say that right now about you know last year 27 and I like turned a corner and I was like all right like everything's going to change like personal life change shift in business how we're looking at things we were going to run this as like a cash flow business now we're going to run it as like a massive business like all that shifted and then however many months ago started the YouTube stuff but that's crazy the lifestyle by design is is real you me and Mike so me and Mike yeah Mike thirst's like one of my best friends and he's probably my oldest friend in the fitness industry, him and like Joe Delaney. So me and Mike in 2018, we actually got put on a trip together in Dubai and it was like we were fitness coaches on a retreat and it was like the first retreat ever. And oh man, we we caused chaos like you know we me and Mike meeting for the first time in Dubai. We were like on like an all expenses paid trip. We were like let's [ __ ] go. So we got really close from then on and me and Mike always kind of had this thing where like we we wanted to lifestyle by design like what you said we wanted uh to build our business around the lifestyle that we wanted wanted to build and so that's one thing I always say like me Mike and Louis Armstrong is another another guy that we're friends with. Uh we have the most fun in the YouTube scene for sure. Yeah. I just met him uh Mike last weekend at Eman's event in London and uh we ended up just smoking like hanging out cigars and this and that and like it's hilarious like no one drinks nowadays. No one I mean there was like one or two people at the table but he's like there was a time boys like there was a time like trust me too there was a time but like it is it has passed. He's like all like stoic and like we're having these like deeper conversations about life, love, and happiness and all this stuff. But like he'll turn a corner and he'll be like, "Yeah, but back in the day." It's like back in the day. Oh man, me and Mike have gone to IA with each other for like three weeks at a time. Like some people go to IBA for like three days. Actually, that's what most people do. Me and Mike like we camped out there for three weeks. I lost like 10 pounds. 10 pounds of pure lean mass coming back coming back a skeleton. Uh but we we the most fun ever. But now like cuz uh Mike I think he's like a year or two older than me. I'm not too sure. You know I'm 33 now and like you have your you have your crazy times and then the older you get you just you've done it all. You know you just done it all and you you kind of get it all out of your system and yeah I find now times are getting more chilled which I like and less crazy drinking a lot a lot less. I think I've drank like four or five times this year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was like I'll do it every once in a while. I'll pick like a wedding or something, but I kind of keep it keep it chill. I'm like, "Yeah." Yeah. He was at my wedding nine months ago and he he was having a good few. He did not have one glass of champagne. No, he I was I was looking at him countless. Are we going to a after this? Are we going to Marbet is close enough? It's close enough. Yeah, that's hilarious. Well, cool. So, all right. So, it starts with online coaching. So, you're doing remote coaching online or you're doing in person at some level as well. So it's all remote. Then it turns into YouTube and like you said six months a year it's like this. So like what is the because we usually talk like info coaching in here and how you monetize and how you distribution like you obviously have acquisition through organic which is like amazing. Uh we always joke like it's a 30 40% difference in the P&L when you do that because you don't spend like you know I spend a dollar to get three on the front and there's all the other ways to make money but like spend 10k make 30 my P&L is like versus an organic guy you have higher show rates higher close rates more quality people and it doesn't cost you cost you dollars like every day it cost you obviously all the time and the and the content production and all the stuff but like so you're doing that and then you're making YouTube ad rev kind of right you're doing remote coaching and then you said stuff around supplements. You said stuff around like how did that and brand partnerships? You're going on these trips like what does that arc look like? I'm not super familiar with Okay. influence. So, so at the beginning like when my page wasn't big enough to take to start like working with companies and brand deals and supplement sponsors and all that. It was all just fitness coaching. So, I guess I guess you can just call that info coaching. You're just giving the information of fitness. So, maybe your viewers can like relate to that a little bit more. And so there's a funny like there's a funny way it started like so this is this is quite some time ago and I find especially in the last three years with the mainstream birth of AI is just so different now. So like 10 years or nine years ago I was doing it via email PDF and it was the only word I can use to describe it was archaic. It was it was barbaric. It was prehistoric. Like I would have to like write I would someone would sign up via my roboblips.com website some [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] on WordPress that always crashed and I would like my coaching program. My god it was like €240 for like six weeks or 12 weeks. I can't I can't remember. It was it was cheap though. And I would just be like doing these emails back and forth. Like if I had like 30 or 40 clients, every Sunday I'd have like 30 40 if not more emails and I'd have to like save PDF and be updating everyone's files and it was so stressful and there was like zero scale to it. Like it was just like I'm literally using like Gmail like that that is it. And then in 20 I did that did that for years and I you know kept increasing my prices and everything. Then in 2018, I built my own app. So I partnered with an app developer who I'm actually still with today. H they're called Macroactive. They're they're really good. There would actually there's a few good guys like the founder especially who uh I I should link you with like you'd have a great chat with them. Like these guys crazy, you know, big big company. And so they built me my own custom app and they kind of assigned me a team. And so that app to build me build I think was it was about 12 or 15k and which was a big which was like a big investment for me at the time but because I had the personal brand and the organic audience built up I made that back in on launch like upon launch and I was just like oh my god and so like people would put in their details programs would be updating automatically I was giving like I think it was like 10% or 15% to for them to do the customer service and I was like Oh, like I I finally felt like I'm scaling. I I I kind of hate that word. It's like if people say about anything, they're like I'm like a lizard scales. So anyways, that was the first time I felt like a real entrepreneur running an actual scalable business and that was the first time I technically had staff and I was able to take a step back and start enjoying myself a little bit. And that's when I started enjoying myself a little bit too much. But but I still always kept things going. But yeah, 2008 MR hits different. Yeah. Oh man, it goes I'm like what is this? What is this? A salary? I haven't had one of these in a few years. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. For sure. So great feeling. And that was like the first time I I felt like, oh, I've I've got this consistent income. I'm completely like location depend independent. I can go anywhere. I can truly run my business from my phone. And so that was in 2018. And so that was like, you know, the way I said like 22, I like, you know, felt my life started. That was another real road step in my life. A real like uh a real, you know, stepping stone, I guess you could say, when I was like I took things to the next level. my lifestyle went to the next level. And so I still do that to this day. Uh it's the app was originally called Lipid Fitness and I re like maybe two years ago I rebranded to Game Plan. I got the username on Instagram, Game Plan. Just pure words. Hacked the hell out of that account. So so clean. And uh so then uh yeah, I rebranded to Game Plan and and that's still going. That's still doing its thing. And there's like over, you know, a thousand users on it and depending on when you get in, but on average it's like 97 per month. So that's doing like phenomenally well and uh very very profitable. And then if you want to talk about info a little bit more, literally two days I launched my first two days ago, I launched my first like business coaching offer. And now so hear me out, right? There's so much frauds in the info product space that will do the thing for one year and then start teaching people how to do the thing. And I'm like, the absolute guff, like the absolute gall, the balls for you to be able to think you're an expert in that field after doing it for a year. I'm like, have you like no morals or no just like humility? Like it's just oh, it's it's like a pyramid scheme. And so I did I did my thing for a decade. Like actually have the receipts. You can go back. I'm living in a hostel and working that shitty job I hated. Like my car is piece of [ __ ] that breaks down constantly. And this one thing I love about Eman and I've actually never said it to him and I I've said it I need to say it to him. He gets like [ __ ] for people saying like oh you didn't come from where you came from all this. He has the receipts. He's got the uploads. He he's got Do you think if he came from this like turbo wealth family like he's just uploading to YouTube for the [ __ ] fun of it? Like if you're actually a billionaire or a millionaire, you're not doing YouTube. Like you're not you don't even have social media because you're so rich. Like and and so that's what I respect so much about him and that's what I relate to. He he has the receipts and so I have the receipts as well. And those OG YouTube videos, I never deleted one of them. They're so valuable to me. I ke they're my most keep the watch the car whatever the keep the Marba villa well maybe not the Marba Villa yeah maybe not that yeah that keep whatever you want but my old YouTube videos showing the beginning of my journey is are so important to me so two days ago anyways I launched my first kind of uh program on how to monetize your social media how to coach people how to make content that converts just just the Rob Lipid starter pack something that I would give to myself when I was 22 and the respon responds. Insane. I mean, I've only done stories promoting it and like there's already over 100 people in the group and I'm just like, whoa. I'm It's so motivated right now. Like, oh, I feel like it feel like Christmas or something. It's It's crazy. And the here's here's the takeaway point from all that. The longer you wait, the better the prize will be. The longer you hold off on cashing in and coming out come asking your hands up the better the punch will be. So have patience and I love this I love the saying right acrew goodwill build up that goodwill provide value for years first and then when you launch that offer sorry before you launch that offer people will be begging you to launch the offer and you'll know exactly what you're meant to do and then you launch that offer and it just it just clicks. So if anyone's watching this, build up that goodwill, provide value for as long as you possibly can. Yeah, I was talking. Yeah, literally Iman, I agree completely. Like the receipts, I probably followed him for eight, 10 years, right? You know, however long he's been doing it. I I remember like starting agency days following his stuff. Never bought anything, never whatever, but like like you said, the goodwill that's built up. He was talking to me about it and he was like, "Dude, the what what was the word? The pent up." He's like, "Keep it pent up." And he's like, "You just have it right now." And I have like hundreds of inbound that are like consulting for this or this or this. And I'm like, hold hold. Like I want to go complete upstream as possible. Like none of this owe five grand for an hour or this or that. I'm like, uhuh. Like I want like something strategic. So make them be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're cooking something fun. But I'm like, yeah. Like it it's uh it's cool. It's cool to see like when you have the receipts like that. So what's the new offer? So like it is it specific for people to start in fitness? So like you said to do like all the pieces of the puzzle for online fitness like a business an online fitness business. Exactly. But um when I kind of you know went live on my stories and from YouTube and this is the power of YouTube actually. So if you watched like if you go into my last vlog I'll send you the clip. It's like in the middle of the vlog and it's like a 20 minute video. I speak about the offer that I'm doing you know and I say like it's for fitness coaches starting out and just simply it's something I would give to 22-year-old Rob. And I I was like, "If you're interested that you want to be my test subject, h go over onto Instagram and just DM me about it." And all of a sudden, like I post the video and then like maybe an hour or so later, all these DMs start coming in. Like I mean hundreds. And I'm like, "What the fuck?" I'm like, "Oh yeah, I mentioned in the YouTube video." And the fact that like people watched halfway to the vlog, picked up on this 30 second thing that I said like on the fly and left YouTube, went on to Instagram, which is a lot of a lot of friction, you know, compared to like someone just sees the story and, you know, tap link clicks. So, someone did all this and I was like, whoa, like the response was crazy. And then I did some Instagram stories off that and got loads of people into the group. So, it was originally just for like fitness coaches, people who wanted to uh get better at social media and enter the fitness industry, but there's people from all industries in it, which it was awesome, which I I'm really happy with, you know, because you don't want to It's good to niche down, but it's cool if someone else wants to jump in. I'm not going to say no. Yeah. No, it's like And it's a lifestyle by design. It's an offer by design. It's like a how do you want it? Yeah. You you create a game plan. Again, it's called the digital game plan. And you create a game plan. you picture your how you want your day to go and then you you build you reverse engineer from that and you make a game plan on how you're going to get there and people's dream life it's a lot closer than they think like when you actually start talking to people like what makes them really happy and how their dream day would look there's no private jets there's no overpriced yachts or watches maybe sometimes but like your typical sprinkle yeah a little bit here and there I did I did just buy a Porsche like two days ago. I went for the KN. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I went for the Cayenne. I went a dad wagon. Yeah. Say dad wagon baby on the way. That fits. That fits. Exactly. But so people's dream life when you actually chalk it down, it's probably a lot closer than you think. Yeah. Yeah. We've uh we've worked backwards. There was a lot of um it's in a lot of the make money online whatever courses. A lot there are some really really good ones. Like I learned everything from that, right? But it's it's a dime a dozen or whatever. It's a 0.1% of the whatever one of every thousand. Tell me some good ones. Tell you some good ones. Yeah. Yeah. So, some of the OG ones are like the the original ones that I got into when we launched this was going to be Becker ovens. So, none of these exist anymore, right? So, like Becker used his as like a Trojan horse to get people into Hyros and it was like packed. It was small group. I think it was only like five grand at the time. Um, but that was his while he was building Hyro. So, he got all those people in there. Taught him YouTube ads, VSSLs. But then the section I'm talking about is like this mindset whatever portion that's like mind, body, soul, like the alignment, focus. Um, uh, Ovenans at the time was on the way out kind of of doing his because he did the same thing, right? He moved into school. So the these both these guys went from info coaching to software. Yeah. So Ovenans was like deep about that which then Iman just bought all the IP and now owns the content and is like releasing it um to all of his community and bonuses which is just his own level of savagery. Um he did what was the selfie upload that he did on consulting.com or something. So he bought so that was the the story around it is he he there was three layers in those. So a lot of these and I want to I want to talk to you about this about your offer but like essentially what's very very common is to have like an ascension ladder or like different offer stack right so for consulting it was a 2K entry product. So as a marketer you're selling you're using webinar funnels whatever and it's a direct toart 2k offer. They used to call it the auto uh the auto 2K web or whatever. I think it was auto 2K but it was auto because people could purchase it without talking on the phone which is like huge leverage in our world because as soon as you get above back then it was two it's probably still close to two but you get to 5k 10k offers you can't sell that with the same conversion rates that you like direct to cart that you can over the phone. So he found the 2k zone and he would automatically sell these and sell like thousands and thousands of them. people get into this group and all it was teaching was essentially acquisition. So it was how to become a consultant right consulting.com how to become a consultant which was basically how to acquire customers for your specific niche how to be the I help XYZ niche do XYZ problem solve and so he taught everybody how to do that and then Ovens very system thinking very like strategic would then take people from that to the next layer which was called uplevel consulting which was 5500 and by the end I think it was like 10 G's but it was how to productize your service so now you have so many clients you're doing what you're saying you're sending them PDF FS in Gmail and like you you can't scale. Terrible word. Uh but you can't like there's no system around fulfillment. So it was then teaching people how to go from here to here which was then productizing your service. So group coaching calls create an info product and like basically do it in that way. So instead of doing onetoone over here, which is like the hardest to fulfill on at scale, you then go to group coaching where you're still the coach though. And then at then at the next scale, you have group you have coaches that are doing the group coaching and like there's all these tanches and I kind of get into that. But like with a personal brand, it's hard to it's hard to remove yourself from that thing. Like so they'll do a weekly call. I actually I like doing them. I always get [ __ ] pumped up on them. But I I have had like I've hired assistant coaches for fitness and everything and so but I want you to go on there. But it's so important the way you market it. If you market it as like hey join my coaching program and then you get an you throw an assistant coach in there. They're kind of people people get pissed off. They're like I want Rob. But if you market it as work with me and my team and you just sell the result uh people are usually pretty chill about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. And it's like so so like those tanches of then the delivery going down and then the top tier of it was like 30k I think uh a year and it was the mastermind and it was you're the category king you own whatever domain. So Iman purchased that. So Iman was in that was like his first and I think only mastermind he purchased and he went in that room and at the time Ovenans was doing the aggressive scale mode had the office did all the stuff and did like you know and this is no [ __ ] on anyone. was like the king of it for a minute, but he was doing like 30 something million and he did like a million in profit on 30 and Iman was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa because his model Iman's like the 80 90% profit margin guy the guy that'll run five million and make three to four like he's that he's that zone right for a long time. So wait's 30 million on one male profit. Yeah, because of the so much team, all that stuff, dude. I mean, we ours wasn't ours wasn't that bad, but we went from 10 million where we were selling info. So, delivery was that group coaching. So, we had like group coaches that were on two weekly calls and then an info product. And it was a,000 up to,500. We sold it over the phone. So, you're paying for ads, you're paying for a sales rep, but your fulfillment is like this. Like, you have like two community managers that lead the calls or whatever. Um, and that was us doing 10 million a year. So, great margins. And then we're like, how do we scale this thing? And we changed the offer. Lizards failed. Yeah. How do we go lizard mode? Lizards ate my profit. Lizards ate my profit up and it we changed it to coaching that was onetoone coaching with a coach. So we already had like brand face experts. So the rob of our brand um and they had already had a team of coaches. So it we already had that pass off that like hard part of like oh they want to work specifically with this person. She does whatever a monthly coaching call or every other but like it was with a coach and that was like 7K or 6K I think when we started selling it. Next thing you know, we go from 10 million to 30 million last year and everything broke. Now I have 70 coaches. We're moving everyone W2. There's 130 employees across this and this. Like it was insanity. And so our margin like went like this. Cash technically we made more profit on dollars. But like very similar to the oven's experiment uh of you go up to these huge numbers and you don't know how to do it and margin just goes in and would just like you know backhand you and be like dude what are you doing? like I would rather run something that makes five million uh in top line and does three million in bottom line than something that does 30 million and does five million in profit. He's like I I would rather you know I mean for the complexity that occurs for the rest of it like it's just not a thing. So because Iman's like me and Mike he likes the good life. Dude, I I get it. I get it. I like the good life too. I just didn't know what I signed up for. I didn't know what I signed up for. Um come on. Yeah, dude. I will. I honestly I might have to. Um, but yeah. So, one thing as well, one thing for you as well. You there's something I watched a video of yours and I need you to remind me about it and talk me through it. So, what caught what caught me with you? You were doing you're doing 70 million on a fitness offer. Yeah. Yeah. You said Yeah. 70 million. And so then and then what were like you did a video and it was I watched to the very end and you're like this is how much I actually take home from that. Yeah. You know, it was very very interesting, you know, like crazy how you go from 70 to this. It was still unreal. But if that was a very my favorite video you've done, I think I would search way back for it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what this is. That's what whatever. Right. So we were playing this info game, but then turned into info coaching and that's like the the brand name or the the high keyword of it right now. But when we moved to coaching, that was like a ton of the revenue, but the profit like took this dive. So we did Yeah. So we're at 76 77 million in total cash on that. Um, but yeah, so I lived in tax-free zone for a minute, which is like the very bottom of the tunch on that video, right? So it's like it goes from topline, topline revenue that people talk about. It's like then it's like what's actual cash collected, then it's all your team, all your things, all your whatever, and it spits out some number that's cash flow, profit, whatever you want to call it, right? And it's like that number. Now, we have partners. I am a co-owner, not a co-founder. So the two of them, the very common business model now is you have a marketer and you have an and an expert. So the expert being the fitness pro and then you have the marketer who just like sells the [ __ ] out of it, right? And packages it. And then when you get to scale, you have an operator because you need to like a lot of these guys go two, three, 500k a month and then kind of just hang out there because they can't do the next layer which is like or they don't want to or whatever. Not to say they can't, but like it it turns into an operation, right? It turns into scaling in these ways and team structure and all this stuff. So we did that and I was like number four or five on the team. um got ownership when they were trying to run like a monthly app kind of situation but we were doing paid ads so the math didn't work right because we like even though the MR was there there was there was paid so like again margin was so we moved over to a call funnel I was talking to the other owners and they were like yeah like yeah you know you're on the cap stack now like you're an owner and but I still you know there's three of us right so do all the math do all the stuff you got 70 million you got the whole team you got all this stuff you got all your paid ads you got all your craziness spits out x number then gets distributed between U3 and however much you take out of it and leave in there because you have future costs because it's an operation. It's a real business now. It's not an offer, right? There's offers. What offer are you on? Or it's like what business are you running? And then yeah, wherever you live, tax zone and then however your lifestyle is and you add all those up and it's like oops like you know it's not the it's not the glamorous vanity numbers that's like oh cool you you three split up 70 million. It's like no. Yeah. So it's like Ryan 70 million tank. That's what it is, right? So, I get messages on X and I'm like, "Oh my goodness." Like, you know, it's it's, you know, it's millions. There's no doubt. But is it like, is it whatever number? And then you add that lifestyle or you decide to be a crazy degenerate person or you live in a high tax zone that's 50% tax and it's like, you know, quick math, right? You take home a million bucks, it's like it's 500 and then you live however way and it's like you're zero on the end of it depending on a certain type of way. Yeah. Exactly. So, yeah. So that was um yeah that was that was a big shift for us and like coming into this year was a big change we made was like we're going to optimize for like we wanted to hit 30 so bad last year and we hit 30.5 um and it was like yeah but we didn't pair it with a profit number and we're like oh so like this year we're like building into this I'm like I refuse to scale I refuse to lean into this thing unless we are at X margin on the way up but dude our team is huge now we're we're like so there did you meet because I I think I know the the girls that run that own the offer. Like I I did some research. I found it cuz I know you don't always say it because like Yeah. I talked about a lot kind of in the beginning and then I was like this is not doing me a service. Like I I needed it kind of as like a crutch to get up there to be like, "Hey, we got something going here." But I was like sharing pages and stuff and then now I just talk like structure and name and like numbers and stuff. But And so how did you meet them in the first place? Like how did you I found the marketer. I found the marketer. So he he met her in a gym and literally started by helping like run paid ads to get her local clients. Like it we're talking like this was eight seven years ago probably now when they like originally originally did this. So it started there and then it moved into the online portion and then he was in consulting.com's middle program and I bought it and he bought it and he had the wherewithal and the understanding to be like, "Oh, I'm going to build this around another expert as the consultant and I didn't at the time." So I bought this thing and I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to be a consultant. I don't want to be in front of anything and I like living in my little shadow. And uh he was like posted something in that group. I clicked on his profile and literally two minutes prior he had posted a thing that was like looking to bring someone on is like my right hand. Teach him this this this about marketing, sales, funnels, all this stuff. And like I knew some of my stuff but I was like this is interesting. Booked a call with him. Next thing you know I'm like building sales pages making a thousand bucks every six weeks basically. And like we're bleeding cash and just trying to figure it out and five grand profit and then two grand and then six grand. And like I flew to Bali to meet them in person after working with them for probably four months. Uh and then flew to Bali and met them in person. Hung out in a v in like a villa we had there for a month. And then COVID hit. Left Bali because we had to like run out of there basically because everything was shutting down and no one knew it was happening. And then a month into that he called me and he was like, "So how are we going to take this thing to 10 million?" And I was like, "Callunnel." And he's like, "All right, ownership check like this." And I was like, "Let's run it." And we built it in like three days using ovens program, using Becker's program. And then I bought one other one that like did the CRM configurations and like the call flows because I didn't I don't know how to do that. So we spent probably 15 grand on courses. I bought two of them by myself. So I'm 10 in like personally and then the business bought one of them for five grand. And uh yeah, we just leaned into it. So I I literally met him inside. I talk about that all the time. It's like where do you meet people that are in this? It's like meet people who bought a program or a thing to get XYZ result and is still in the trenches with you. And it's like side by side. You guys are both trying to achieve the same. like you already have so many similarities in what your goals are and like what you're trying to do or what business model you're trying to run or whatever. So yeah, I met him in there. Nice. That and I love love what you said there. Right. So I um I do an event in Marba every single year. Another word that I hate mastermind, but I don't know what else to call it. I'm like workshop workshop seminar scaling mastermind. That's the master lizard. Just a big [ __ ] lizard comes out and just starts breathing fire. But yeah, so I do I do a Marba mastermind every year and I literally the the last one was 10 days ago, a week ago. Yeah. Yeah. Every year. And for the last like three years since I since I moved there. And so the last one it just went I'm I'm actually putting together the YouTube video like the recap of it. It's [ __ ] sick video. It's like a movie. It's like 40 minutes long. But it it's always like my favorite weekend of the year. I just bring like oh I should put you in touch with some of the speakers like the found the founder of founderly and everything like um Neil Schneider like he'd be so good for you to meet like some real top dog killers 10 speakers just drop game for the day h Friday we all meet in my villa we go out to dinner Saturday is the is the main day of the seminars and then villa turns into a villa party Sunday 5k run and a lifting session with myself and then a beach club for the day and like it's that's that's the idea itinerary and it's it's an amazing weekend. But going back to what you said about meeting people in the group like I always check in on all the attendees and they're all starting businesses together and they're all like doing these side quests together and it's it's the best feeling ever seeing that when they're like, "Oh, we met at your event." And there was actually I did like I've been doing these events in Dublin before that since like god would have it been like 2018 or 19 just before co and there's been like two or three guys who've met at the event and they make like multi-million dollar companies like they've made like one of Irish Ireland's biggest street wear brands from like going to these events. I'm like can I get some can I get some shares in that? It's a crazy feeling and it's always a nice feeling but that's so bang on what you said. join a program, meet people that way as that's how you're going to meet the right crowd. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. It's monetization model. Instead of charging your 10K to go, you got to just charge percents of anything they start. Um equity deal. Everyone must sign the agreement. 10 year 10-year contract. Anything you start, I'm on the cap table. Yeah. Uh that's amazing. So like, so what's your what's all of that right now? So like you still have the app, right? So you said you you continue that going. You have the new offer which is like literally brand new. Um, and that's more like biz op of fitness, which those crush by the way. I gotta connect to you or like point you to some directions of if you're interested. But so what's like the the design of that? So people come in for a monthly thing. Is there like ascension? Is there And then there's a mastermind and then you said something about supplements earlier. Sorry, I'm kind of bouncing off but like Yeah. No. So my various sources of income, I think there's like six or seven or something when you break it down. So it's like game plan fitness game plan business YouTube then ghost ghost like supplements. So I'm like I've heard three things about that. Y they are the they just like sold to Dr. Pepper for 1.7 billion and I'm like am I getting a raise then? Yeah. You bump it on my salary and they're like yeah. So you know I've got that and then also I'm a athlete ambassador for Alflelet as well. Christian Guzman, uh, like one of my best friends now, but one of my original inspirations to start out in the fitness industry. You know, you I'm I'm sure you know who who he is. Like he's just know who he is. I don't know him, but I know who he is. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So, I've got Alfleet as well. And then just all things that kind of come with it. So, yeah, you know, everything just goes back to kind of fitness and YouTube, but the most new thing that I'm doing is is the business uh coaching offer. And I'm just having so much fun with that. at the moment I like just did an annual membership which is like 1K and you know signups were amazing on that like so good like and I didn't have to jump on a single call. Something that you said uh you said it at the start with the the 2K call thing I I [ __ ] hate calls. I I hate I'm like I have to like I miss them most of the time and I'm like I have to interrupt my day for this. So usually I I have a sales team Yo, are we back? That would happen. Are we back? That would happen to us. Yeah, we're back. Somehow it's still going. Somehow it's still going. Oh my god, it's still going. 43 minutes. Still going. I'm so raw with these. I know. I may I honestly I may clip it. I might not clip it. Sometimes I'm literally so raw with these. Like I was on with William Brown and he's like, "Dude, I have to take a wee." And I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "We?" I'm like, "What are you He's like, "I have to go to the bathroom." He's like, "I have to delete." I'm like I'm like, "Dude, I'm not pausing this." So, anyone who's here, like, say whatever. 2.5. And I do my comments are all like 2.5 2.5 2.5. I'm just sitting there alone while he's peeing. Bro, that's so Well, look, I've got I've got a little backup going here. Let's go. I know. You get away. But the fact that it's it still says 45, then I'll handle it. I'll figure it out. Thanks. Like, surely you can afford an editor at this stage, right? I still won't do it, but yes, I can. I like doing though. But I was just going on about how much I I the pricing off my business offer, which is a grand for the year, and I love that because it's just people will sign up without like you needing to talk them off the ledge, so to speak. Um, and then I'm going to So, oh, by the way, as well, I I'm hosting it on [ __ ] Are you? Which is like Yeah. Which is Eman's thing. Get this. Okay. Okay, so go back to quickly finish up the pricing about a grand annual membership. Going to maybe do 95 per month and then as soon as I have enough social proof and that people actually like the program, then you can increase the pricing, of course, but you you can go up, but you can't go down. The worst is when you start off too high and then you put your tail between your legs. 12 people in the group. It's just a ghost town. It's just a ghost town. No one's talking. Everyone's just like, "Yeah, what is this?" So, I increased it over time if people get good results. But, so I started hosting it on [ __ ] And get this right, not sure if you know Dan Tells, he's like head of partnership um at WAP. So, some mutuals put us in touch. I saw the Eman announcement and I was actually I had the course the long like ready to go on school and they were like, you know, I was just signing up to it like they didn't know who I was. Then WAP and the team Dan like reached out to me individually and were like we would love to host you on [ __ ] if you will have like a direct contact if anything goes wrong with payments if you need any adjustments you just WhatsApp us and hit us up and I was like that is invaluable. They logged into my school and like handpicked all my content and put it on W. So that's how ambitious they are. And I was like they're savages. They're all over it. like they reply they reply to a text in in seconds. any anytime any whatever someone at the event so Cam one of the founders flew from San yeah flew from uh San Francisco to uh London landed got in an Uber whatever came to the event literally walked in the door was there for like 10 minutes then had to give his talk like he did a Q&A basically at the event and then he's talking and he's like and it's like 2:30 probably and uh in the morning no 2:30 p.m. and like whatever. But no, no, get this. So then Ari is sitting next to me and I was like, "Yeah, when do you guys leave?" And he's like, "Oh yeah, me and Cam have a flight at 4:30." He flew from San Francisco to London, got in a car, came, spoke for an hour, and then literally they both got in a car as soon as they were done, and they went back to the airport to leave two hours later. No way. Not even like have a look around London or difference, dude. He rolls up and he's in like a four seasons like 2XL like polo that has like whatever and he's like sorry about my outfit. I haven't been home in like two and a half months and like they're just boopping from place to place and he's just grabbing a shirt at whatever place they're staying and like doing his thing and like dude they are they are unbelievable. They flew me out like over the summer probably. So they were definitely already in it in info coaching but like every freaking week is like a new for them. Um, and then obviously all the Eman stuff, but what they've built is is really cool. And then for fitness, I really like it. For fitness, I'll be interested to see because you're I guess you're doing your bisop version of that on there. But they were they were trying to talk to me about putting our stuff on there and I'm like, there's no way like it's just not built for our demo is 40 to 60 year old women. I'm like, there's just no way they're going on wop.com to do anything. They won't be able to work it. Yeah, they won't be able to work it. I thought the software was kind of complicated and like initially like even like the kind of UI the interface and everything I was like a bit it looked a bit trade in crypto but it's actually really simple like once you get on it and I just have like you can have all these apps on it like all these features or you can have it really minimal like I just have calls live streaming uh various forums like so I have content review forums uh personal brand audit forums and like now all the members are like answering for me. So, I don't even have to do anything. I'm just like chilling. I have that at the calls and then I have the actual all the video modules and everything. And that's it for now. Like I'm like live streaming as well. But it's re really simple if you set it up simply. They're beast. They're good. They're beasts. Yeah. They're uh one of the big things they were announcing. So, first off, you just got in when they have new UI, which is hilarious because it was way worse, right? So, they just changed the UI. So that that may and it's still a little complicated, but um they have they're basically doing like a become Shopify for info. So they have a new that app marketplace thing is crazy and he was talking about at the event, but they'll have like uh someone can make an app like let's say leaderboard like it's however many YouTube videos you upload and everyone submits them and you're trying to like rank them amongst the members. You decide to build this thing and you pay two grand, five grand, whatever for a developer to build it. Once it's inside your [ __ ] you can then white label it essentially and like have it on the marketplace. So anybody else who wants to use that leaderboard app or widget can use it for 10 bucks a month. And like you build like MR off apps that you built that you might want to custom build for your thing and then people can do their own like layovers and design and change things on it or like have different calculations but because you built the framework it's there. So they're going like they're going there which is so the example they use is like a macro app like if you want to have a macro tracker which I know you're not doing the the the fitness in there but you're doing like that is everyone on it. Yeah it's super cool. So okay so then people are coming in so a thousand that's hilarious and then I mean that's that's very affordable uh in our world of like how you do things but then what a lot of people will do is like you said mastermind as an example but like the tanches being info coaching course is like down here it's like what you can charge and generally where it sits and then it's like with the group coaching calls right which is where kind of you're at and then group coaching and then it goes to like having a uh having coaching calls with a coach either in a group setting or then onetoone with a coach coach and then it goes into group coaching with you and then it goes into onetoone with you and like and masterminds and that whole thing. So like the trunch generally is how people do that. So do you have like any plans to do like if someone was like yeah cool or if you if you spun up an offer that was like 10k and you'll do the customization and some people are like not into that. They're like whatever I just want my MR and I just want my squat like I don't want to do calls. I don't know I don't want to do it. But like Mike for example Mike was like absolutely not. He's like I know I'm very me and Mike are very similar. So, I do have like 10k fitness offers that I've h ran before and even even a little bit higher than that actually, you know, um people who want to work with me for a long term longer longer term and I the one of the best offers I've ever dropped is I got to say this is pretty sick. Okay, so it was like you know a high it was like 10 15k offer and all my like audience are mainly like uh US, Irish and English. So you can all get to Marbaya fairly easy, especially Ireland, England. It's like two-hour flight. So you the opportunity to come and train with me in Marba whenever you wanted. And like obviously people aren't going to like they're not going to take the piss and do [ __ ] show up every week. You know, most people just did it did it once. But that was like a really cool offer. You know, we come train together. Obviously, there's constant support from me and my team, but then everyone would come out to Marbaya at one stage and I'd be co like coach them in person, you know, which reminds me of my like very very early days, but I wasn't charging 12K back then. Then I'd be set I'd be set for life back then. But so that that's probably the highest offer that I've ran. But it again, it is it is very fullon. Like I like the more hands-off approach, you know, the Mike Thirsten approach is we're calling it. So that's that's mainly what I do. But, you know, I definitely I've dabbled in the in the higher higher ticket stuff before. Yeah. And then so Okay, then let's talk partnerships. So, you said uh so appar basically apparel and supplements. So, like in this industry, right? It's it's quite funny. Everyone has like their two things. It's always like supplements and clothing. And so, the ones that I'm with, I personally I think it's the dream team. I think it's the best brands in the industry, which is Alfleet and Ghost. you know, they're like and a lot of the athletes who are with Alfleet will also be with Ghost. So, it's kind of like a little mini click. It's like a little niche. Uh, but they're just two amazing brands to work with. Like the only brand actually bigger than Alfleetle is Gym Shark and then who Christian the owner used to be sponsored by by Gym Shark. So, it's a little bit bit of a story there. But, Ben Francis, you know, I was actually just talking to him yesterday. You know, he's a great guy. I've got another event um in Marba in November. Trying to get him to speak at it. He's a he's a billionaire, so it might be might be hard. Might be a little busy. Uh yeah, might be a little busy, but I'm like, "Come on, Mark. Come on, leave the family. Let's go." He's got a crazy arc, too. I' I've followed his stuff for a long time. Like I, you know, I I see the recap ones of him like, you know, holding up the t-shirt, printing in the garage. Like, I don't think I was that early, but like definitely definitely earlier than, you know, billions and where they are today and all that. Yeah. I followed him in the t-shirt printing era like I remember that I was like why didn't I start that but so going back to it I'm with Alfleet and Ghost and so I don't want to give the figures that they would pay me per month because like other athletes would be like hey I'm getting ripped off but it but it's a a sizable amount. It's a more than a doctor or a lawyer would be getting anyway. So which I always feel like I'm like this is absolutely [ __ ] nuts. Like I'm getting paid more than like a doctor and a lawyer and all these professions for for products and stuff that I would do for free. Like that's why I have well I've got an insane imposter syndrome, but I think imposter syndrome's a great thing. I think we should all have a bit of imposter syndrome because well first of all the real imposters don't get it. They're all sociopaths. They're all nuts. But I think imposttor syndrome it shows that you're you're leveling up constantly and you're always in a place and you're like whoa like how am I here? I think imposter syndrome is just being grateful you know and I'm one of the most grateful guys that that you can ever meet. So I've got plenty of imposttor syndrome and I think it's a good thing. Yeah. I I get it like crazy with some of this stuff. Like we're just talking like the numbers that spit out on the bottom of this and like you know I'll talk to some people that right now are cash flowing like more than we are just on like the because we we exploded and came down to like this little middle ground and now we're back to like on pack for whatever record months but like it's crazy. I'm like I talk all about the systems and the business and the structure and the whatever not like oh look at me or like look at my car and look at my stuff. So like I kind of feel a little more in alignment with like no this is real. This is what we build. But like there's definitely the trickle effect of like what's hitting the checking account every you know every other week or month or whatever. And it's like that's a little out of alignment when we're like in the [ __ ] of it and trying to like rebuild. It's like nothing's coming out of it. We're leaving it and letting it like shore everything out. But that's Do you have do you have your own like personal offer or is that something that you're going towards? I think that I think that's what you're going towards with the YouTube channel. No. No. It's like so I I'm bouncing around on that because I like literally say in my videos I'm like I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. Nor do I want to take someone's 10K, 50K, whatever, which like is in which is very realistic. Like the the amount of people that are asking for consulting, whether it's as a percentage or a dollar value or an hour or a monthly or whatever, is like it's I have hundreds and I'm like like you you come across very genuine and professional and like I'm like this guy is you're showing you're showing everything. You're show proof of work. Like you come across very genuine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My version of receipts, right? I don't have years of videos, but I have years of what we actually did. But I didn't upload it, right? And it's like, so I can go back and I I have, you know, literal receipts. Uh I have literal, you know, cash collected receipts, but like Yeah. So I don't know. Um I I have some very interesting offers that are very large and uh I kind of want to do a cool like partnership play. I would be I would be down to do stuff as a percentage. So a three to 500k a month company that's doing mainly organic or whatever in in my world of info coaching is right here. and I could take them to a million a month and it's like get a percentage of kind of growth. Like I don't feel like that's selling stuff and the fulfillment would be through calls. Uh maybe like a lean team that I have deployed. I have tons of partnerships that would be like in actual businesses not helping just like an offer would be like oh cool now I own half or 20% or whatever in between those ranges and we're going to scale it in lead genen and affiliate in paper call in info coaching like in all these places. So I just have to figure out like what the plan is. Like I have no EA still. I have no whatever. Like my entire personal life like lit on fire when I started doing this. Like I was so manic. Like I have this business that we're, you know, is in the [ __ ] of it. I'm hiring a CMO. We're hiring a CSO. We're like chief of all this stuff. We're ramping them. So that's this much of the day. We're onboarding like doing all that. I have now I like, hey, cool. I'm going to make a video a day and make a mirror board or an interview or something. And for the first 60 days, it was all miro boards. I'm like, I have no idea what to talk about today. I'm like building these things out, trying to fit in the schedule. Something's on fire. where I'm like sitting at this desk like 16 hours a day because I can't manage my time and figure out how to structure it and then like oh hey also I have this personal life I'm trying to like maintain and like I was dropping the ball left and right left and right like I was it was like it was like embarrassing. I was like my skill set is not evolved to where I can handle all of this and I signed up for it and I did this to myself like fully did this to myself. So I'm kind of back in that like lifestyle by design phase. I have I'm like crippled by opportunity right now. Like I literally have That's amazing. Like I love I love that crippled by opportunity. I am crippled by opportunity and it's like and I and you know I look at your stuff I look at a lot of these guys and it's like not even like comparison game or whatever but it's like how is someone else doing it and what pieces and parts do I like love about it? Like I and even talking to you or talking to um Mike is like the lifestyle by design you guys have chosen is you know I don't want to go look at the waterfalls. I don't like to bounce around and travel too much, but like I do want the freedom aspect of it completely. And like sometimes I have golden handcuffed myself to the desk where yeah, the income's there. Yeah, we're crushing. Yeah, we have the notability or whatever. But like I don't have as simple as like, oh cool, I'll stack days or weeks with calls that are all over the board to like run things and and and lean in scale. I was going to say scale, but uh to like go into there's no other word for it. I can't stop it. But like I I'll get into these modes where that's going to happen and then I love it and I'm in it for like 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, whatever. And then all of a sudden I'm like I want to do something else and I can't because I did this to myself. So like I've I've it's taken time and I've gotten better at it where I've wound down to where like I have like four hours of meetings a week like on my actual calendar that are to like run the whole thing, but we're talking here and there's an 8mm Slack conversation about this or you know nine different random vendor research. So I'm getting better at it. But all loop around to say the lifestyle by design. I'm trying to I'm trying to work on that. I'm trying to decide what it is before I pick one of these opportunities. that's like what's important to me because I have a deal right now that's essentially you know four or five million bucks a year call it let's say that's like right here but is like is it this much work and I'm going to have to be in these other locations and I'm like is that worth it versus or like you know some of them have like let's just say um a lot more social clout in with them because of how the partnership would be and it's like is that valuable and not dollars but like in all these other ways but like I already have all this opportunity and that's just more opportunity inside our world of info coaching online whatever you call And it's like, do I want to just make a bunch of cash and then kind of exit that and go into like this fun other world of like we all play in this like little puddle over here and there's like real business, big business that lives over here. Like do I want that challenge? I don't know. So I don't know. The personal life, I'm 28 now. So the party days are over. Like I I hit that hard. I did these kind of things and I'm like, you know, girlfriend life, family, friend, all that stuff. Did the Puerto Rico Where you living actually? Where where tax? I was in I did Puerto Rico for the last three years, which is like I guess when you said taxree tax version of it and I was like super isolated. I was in like party mode. Like I just like making a bunch of money, spending a ton of money, bouncing around like crazy. Like just it wasn't that serious. Like is the easiest way to say it. Like life just wasn't that serious. And then ended up uh girlfriend life changes all the stuff. And I was like this like I'm doing this for money. I can make double the amount of money and just do it from the States. And like it net nets the same. But like who cares? Like I'm fine on cash. like life's fine. And so I moved back to where essentially like close to where I'm from um initially and it's like hometown friends that I've been friends with like the boys for 15 years all crushing their own domain but like no one online uh same that that's what all my school friends as well they're all doing so well super successful but you know all very different and that's great because like when we link up like I'm in Dublin now and we're all linking up there's always so much to talk about and like it's nice to be around like not fitness industry Yeah, dude. But I will say like it's nice until like I love the like love those guys. Like so it literally was like family, friends, girlfriend all lived in like this, you know, call it 30 minute zone and I was like cool, I'll just pop back there. Very easy to do. I did it and it's like winter. I've lived in all these beautiful like, you know, sky like just beautiful like glass boxes all over in Chicago and Puerto Rico and over in Scottsdale and like these nice places and now I'm in like what am I doing? Like what am I doing? and it's cold and I don't want to go outside and all the blinds are I'm like what am I doing with my existence? So then it's like all right should I go back to PR? Should I go over to Scottsdale because that's kind of like a little hub for that. And then I love the guys and the family and the friends. But it used to be really fun when I flew in every month and we all everyone met and we had these big dinners and we all like kind of caught up. You know the boys chat has 400 new messages a day so we're definitely already privy on what's happening. But I don't know it turned into it turned into not what I expected um due to me not due to them. But like I'm cool with not hanging out with everyone three times a week. I'm cool with seeing them once every few weeks or month. Um and then yeah like the girlfriend stuff and like just trying to navigate that and then I just took on so much like immense work pressure that I like [ __ ] crippled like I like was like I have to be at this desk 16 hours a day until I get this right and do a 100 days in a row on YouTube today day 98. Um, and then I can like take a breath, relook at the scene, be like, "Okay, I'm no longer a cog in the machine that I created." But I had to prove it to myself that I could do it. I had to get that like confidence under the thing that's like I can do a 100 days of this in a row. I can meet all these people. I mean, [ __ ] I'm on with you. I'm on with these like crazy people that like I've seen online and get kind of like that authority in the space. And then now it's like, okay, now what do I want to do with this literal crippling amount of opportunity? Like, how do I want it? Do I want to just make 100 grand a month from these like little things over here? Do I want to like do this big boy thing that's like three 500k a month? Do I want to do none of them and start my own thing that becomes massive? Like I don't I don't know yet. So well, all while growing the golden goose that ideally is going to go to 10 in a month plus and that'll take care of everything and more, right? Oh man, for sure. Like that I think I think you can afford the groceries with that. Yeah. No, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. But that's like that's our big goal. We have friends that do that. Like I I would I mean I don't like to docks and say company names and stuff on here, but like we have a couple I know of three guys. One is all ecom, one is info and ecom, and one is info. And all three of them do over 10 million a month with at least 25% margins. Crazy, right? Two and a half million bucks a month hitting the bottom line. And one of them has partners, one of them is like a family. Actually, they all do. They all have at least two partners. So two partners, like probably five, and then two. But like [ __ ] you're talking about a million a month basically per partner at those levels and then you start to get into like enterprise. Yeah, it's crazy. And then the only other people that like really like in info coaching land, it's like, you know, Iman is the extremely lean version of that. He he posted his numbers, he said something along the lines of like, you know, 10 million from an event and theirs is like all profit basically what they do. So, it's like they did that, but theirs is like this launch model. And then there's a lot of guys that run them that are evergreen organic that just come in and have these big It's just crazy. It's just crazy this space for the lifestyle to cash flow. Like what am I what am I getting myself into? That's I was asking you like what the offer stack is because it's like people come in on your annual or monthly, but like what's the next tier up? What's the next That's how everyone makes like the big money. Yeah. Yeah. I I need to come to you for some advice on that. Yeah, I don't know about that, but Well, cool. So, what are I mean, what are next plans play? What are So, where do you want to take this thing? Where are we on? We're almost at an hour or we might even be in over who knows what's happening with our Riverside connection. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But, so yeah, I mean, you have family stuff, you have Yeah. What's What's hot? Yeah. So the next thing and the only thing that I can rethink about and this is more important than any numbers any lizard scales more important than anything is that I've got fam I've got my firstborn child coming in two days so it's June 18th today June 20th is the due date we're going to guess we're like feeling it's going to be like maybe around June 25th or something and you know that's that's the best thing you can really do in life like it's meant to be a high like no other and even up until now finding an amazing partner. Me and my wife, we've been together six, six, seven years. We got married just nine months ago. Um, just feels the exact same though, you know, because we were with each other constantly. Like the best thing I've ever done is just you have a beautiful girl that's in love with you and you just you just travel. You're just going about your day-to-day life. She supports you 100%. It's like having a cheerleader with you 247. And that's just that's just the best, you know, and that's what what I'm really excited for next. And this like this past nine months since I like knew that I'd be bringing a child into this world just being so motivated like just and obviously I've barely been drinking, barely be going out. So focused, motivated on business and everything. And it's been an amazing nine months. I'll probably be sleepd deprived now. This is like the last podcast I'm doing beforehand. I'll be sleepd deprived and dead to the world for a few weeks. But yeah, that that's the next focus. Um but I'm I'm not going to drop the ball on this. um this this uh program that I just dropped that I just launched. I'm very excited for that. And you know, we've got a good good dynamic. She she doesn't she works for me pretty much. So, it's not like she has to go into a 9 to5 and answer to some other dude, which I I find kind of weird, but you know, you not go there, you know, we can just chill there. We could go there. I'm hoping by Exactly. She can just chill and look after our baby girl. So, uh, I'll I'll still be able to focus on business. Yeah. No, it's amazing. Yeah. The I watch back some of your like old stuff and like you're just it's just it's cool to see the arc, right? It's cool to see the growth arc. Yeah. Yeah. To get into that mode, right? And it's like um I don't know. It comes different for everyone. Some people I know they're I don't I don't know if they'll ever get there, right? Like they still live the party zone, the party life, and they just, you know, they say they're interested in it, but they don't. And it's cool to see like you in practice and in action literally doing it, right? and actually making the changes and actually talking about it in the way and like Yeah, it'll be funny to see Yeah. how much how much uh sleep comes from it when you have now those two existing. Yeah. I'm I'm just going to take off my whoop. I'm just take that thing off. Yeah. I'm gonna pop this bad boy off. Just just throw throw it in the bin. But Ben talks about his on he's got what multiple like they're kind of like low-key about it. But he talk about another guy who's crushing it. Uh uh Gym Shark, right? like he's got his little family situation and his like it's amazing, right? He's got the honestly if you work hard enough all your problems disappear. Like that's one thing my mother taught me growing up and like to to be a little bit like crass. She's like you know if you make enough money you your life there's no stress in your life. Like I hate to say that like it's but you don't have to make like ridiculous amounts but the more money you make and the more freedom you have the less stress and the the way a lot smoother your life is going to go. Yeah. And so I'm sure Ben like has everything covered in terms of that. But I'm sure he still has some challenges as well. Stress, different things for sure. But but as as a man, as a man, like the harder you work, the easier your life is going to be. Hard work equals hard choices, easy life. And that's something that, you know, my mother and my father as well, he was an army officer. We just met for coffee there. Actually, he all they always instilled in me. Yeah. No, that's amazing. Yeah. My dad did landscape and still does landscape snow since he was like 16 years old and like would bring me to all these business things when I was 10 and like definitely like cemented that in me or like kind of foundationally built that. But I yeah, I'm I'm navigating. I again I I I like to watch you and like peace and part and these other people that do this, but the personal plus business stack like you're saying like oh if you just work and work I'm like I'm doing the work part but like trying to be able to be good at the other parts like it's just not innate to me to be able to do all the things really well. So yeah, I don't know when the time will come or or how I need to navigate and change the behaviors and whatever to like be the best at all those things because like right it seems like you are doing a good job of that. You know, I'm not gonna I'm not going to give you the the best of the best unless you want it. But, uh, yeah, I think it's I think it's hard to do for it's very hard to do. Have your cake and eat it, too. Well, cool, man. Um, any other things on here? I mean, obviously, everyone's got to go and find your uh your your new offer. I think I might have to go get your new offer. Maybe I'll have a fitness arc. Um, but do Yeah, DM DM me on Instagram founder and and you'll get an autoresponse. Do you get a link to it?
