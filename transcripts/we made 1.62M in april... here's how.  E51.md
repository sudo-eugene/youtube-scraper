In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we did 1.62 million in cash collected last month and why that blows. I'm going to do a quick recap of where we were in years prior and then we're going to break down what went right and what went wrong last month and where we are changing things. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected and we've done 72 million 73 I think now uh million in cash collected in this business in total. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on this channel is sharing what did work, what didn't work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. all the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. So let's get into it. So in 2022 we were at 690K 23 695. Last year we did 2.75 and again that was the year we did 30 million and this month last month was 1.62. All right. So not good. Not in the right direction based on where the team size is. Not good, right? Um, so as you can see on this, like the slight down tick here, we've been trending at around that rate for the first few months of this year. All since around Q4 of last year, so acquisition broke. And if you watch other videos on the channel, I talk about how acquisition broke. And now we're in a situation where sales is there, marketing is there, and sales is not. So as you can see here on this chart, we have 110k days, 105, 100, 105, 10 whatever, and then like 30 or 50. It's like the most inconsistent thing you've ever seen. But that's good to know that when they are doing good, it's the same lead quality, it's the same volume uh and they are backing out to over 100 which is on pace for that three million. We just need consistency. So what went right marketing? So what we are currently w uh running inside the marketing team is this. We have a VSSL funnel is going to be along this top here. So optin page name, email running to a VSSL page. We have splits of these going on of different VSSLs as well as different opt-in pages going to an application page which we splited our way out and then changed routers that go through to qualified bookings and disqualified bookings that land in different buckets of closers based on their um close rates and like that where they're tiered. They land on success pages and then go to a sales call with a closer where then they are sold and go to terms. Okay, so that's going to be your VSSL funnel. The DTA is essentially a direct to application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL, but you're it's headline VSSL app button under it pop up and you apply right there. So, you don't have to it's non-gated, so you don't need uh the opt-in to get there. I have other videos talking about where the pros and cons of these different funnels. This one gets higher throughput um but sometimes does not get as high as quality depending on how well you do with framing and it just doesn't push as much consumption or add as much friction. Okay, so we're running this one right now testing. We have three of these going. one is like a clear winner amongst those three. Um, so we actually just toggled to just run that one. And then we have other variations coming out that may push more consumption like button uh delays, stuff like that. And that runs here and then runs through that same routing process. And then the low ticket, we have a low ticket funnel that is a two-step. So first page is a sales page. They begin the checkout with name, email, go to the checkout page, you get an opt as a lead. Then they check out, they then book direct in. I have other videos talk about this again but I talk uh pretty extensively about this where it's an ascensionbased funnel not a uh front-end profitable focused funnel. So it is not optimized for AOV like you always yes want to get AOV higher but the more important thing is ascension through the next steps which is booking with a setter setter booking to a closer closer closing them okay and I have other stats where I talk about stats of these uh I'm sorry other videos talking about all the stats of these and those are the three funnels that we're currently running in the value vortex okay so those are the three setters are grabbing auto sets self sets and confirm sets so this is all new to us um last month I believe was the first we started maybe it was end of the month prior. Um, but they are officially now claiming all marketing bookings directly. So, doing call confirmations. We took off the call center that was doing uh 20our day, 7-day a week calls uh for us to confirm bookings. They are doing self-set, meaning the classic run through the CRM, find them um dial 100, get five, your pick up five, you know, one set. And then auto set are those implementation quick start calls that happen post uh low ticket booking. Okay, so we're running all three of those. We scaled the team to like 15 or whatever it is right now already. Uh, and that is cranking along. Now, we're hearing stats on what they should be, what they shouldn't be, more outbound dials, all these things. I don't know. All I know is it's getting us 40, 50 sets a day. Um, which is high, right? And it just drives down that cost per booking uh as like a blended number. Okay. Booking volume has been steady on the tail end of this month over like over half the end of this month. it's uh you know whatever quick number 100 150 200 whatever the numbers um of booking volume that's steady day over day reviews push we had like one lower review come through and we were like let's just try and flood it out and we did our process that I have another video on that talks about how we do review collection we pushed that and got hundreds of reviews and we hit like a new tier for us on all that which is great across all of the socials backend buildout this is huge I will do another video on this once it's live or kind of the plan for it when it is But we're at this Anik uh Singal Expert Summit event right now. And this was like kind of one of the main pieces of what he talked about, which is essentially you're doing acquisition that liquidates a little bit. So call it 50% of that. Then they're selling they're moving through the funnel to a higher like core main program, a 5K, a 10K, a 30K, whatever your main offering is. So you liquidate a portion, cash trough until you get to there where you actually make some profit. And then on the tail end of that is where you have your recurring, your mastermind, your low ticket. Just something that is recurring. It's built in that is membership that is very sticky. Um some people do it with software. It's like a Trojan horse style thing. Um but either way, that is where the profit comes from. That is where the baseline comes from that can cover all of your operating expenses. So quick math, let's say it's $300 a month. You get 3,000 of them. You're making 900 to whatever a million depending on pay plans or things you decide to roll out. And that is covering a million bucks a month in overhead that you would have depending on your gross margin on that which generally speaking is like 99% because it is a one too many if anything cost to fulfill on that back end ideally if you build it correctly. So we are building one of these out. We've never had one. The only thing we've ever had on the back end is just buy more of the same stay for another year do that. So I think this going to be huge for us. It's also a piece of the puzzle that is goes into the enterprise value where you have recurring, you have community, you have growth there when right now ours is like single termed where it's a year. This one is continuous. It is recurring. It is there is year options and pay plans but it is continuous. So that SEO we did some fun stuff here. We got some scores up to like 100. We have a bunch more traffic that we're getting on the pages that we want to be getting traffic. So, it's actually not that much more in terms of like actual clicks and open or I'm sorry, clicks and sessions um that we're getting, but it is the higher intent and for the keywords we want, which we've never ever focused on. So, this is cool. Show rates those climbed. I did videos on this, but we have hammer them strat going. We have now with the setters. Setters have the craziest show rates I've ever seen. Like on certain stuff, it's like 80s and 20 plus percent live call, which is like double for us, which I know is bad. I'll get there. Um 100k days. I talked about that brief, but again we are these are 100k 100k 100k I think that was like 95 I don't even remember but I think that was 95 but this is terri this part's bad and I'll go into that in the what went wrong but back into 100k days we had a bit there where we were not and it was just sweaty not cool um because again for those of you who are new here why this really blows is because this is basically like break even at these numbers just because team is so big and the team is built to be doing three plus a month three to five a month um on the operational side There's some stuff that would scale up in terms of fulfillment, but all those costs are pretty lock. It's just the overall arching team. Everyone's W2, not 1099. We're built like a real business on an offer and it's still when we have these low dips, it's not good. So, hiring and sourcing using everything that we view you that is happening here on YouTube with my stuff as well as just the company being so branded, so well done and like known in the space, we attracting top talent for everything. So, I made posts. We're trying to hire a sales manager. we got the top top top people. Um, and we have been filtering through those. And it's just cool to see that what we're doing here, what I'm doing here with the YouTube stuff and X and whatever is paying off for that. And then also, like I've made in other videos, our chief of people is like a rockstar when it comes to this. So, we already get good talent in that way. This was just kind of like gasoline on it and more specific to our industry for the marketing, acquisition, sales side of things, which is like kind of the pocket that we live in. Um, so that's been really good networking event. We're at an event right now in Dallas. Met a ton of cool people. I've always been like in the cave and the quiet one and it's nice to go to these and meet people and go to the dinners and have fun. Learned a ton of stuff. Um, a ton of stuff and the little things at certain levels can be two, you know, the two, five, 10% lifts can be millions of dollars when done correctly. Um, and then splits on splits. This is just kind of a joke, but we're constantly running new splits. We launched two new ones this morning. We launched three last week. We're constantly crowning things or finding them. And then also trying to make sure I say that in the same breath as like there's such thing as splitting your way to zero where you just continuously try and split test split test until at some level there's like non continuity or like congruency across things and it breaks things. So we're trying to be cognizant of that but for us with the three different funnels it's pretty easy to segment what is being tested and what's not and make sure that there is continuity across them. So splits on splits what went wrong sales for booking CPA consistency financing numbers more things went wrong than this. I am absolutely sure of it. I have to get on a plane so I'm being quick. Uh but that is basically all sales. So for us for a long time it was marketing marketing marketing marketing marketing. You know we kind of are more of the people who believe in like one thing being the issue at a time like focus on one core thing. There's a million things going out of business very core departments that are constantly running and like achieving their things. But at some level there's always a bottleneck that is just like physics or something. It's it's there's always a bottleneck somewhere even if it's a little. And for us right now, it was marketing for a long time. Marketing is now in, CMO is now in. They're cranking. Um, setters now are in. Like the booking volume is there. The quality is there. And they are not backing out. So we have days like we lit a fire today and we're at I don't even know 12 something 13 14 unit like we're crushing today because we like lit a fire kind of thing. And that's not how it should have to be. It should just naturally be like that. So sales per booking CPA is a direct correlate to that because if you have a 15% versus a 30% live call close rate, it legitimately, you know, cuts your CPA in half. Um, so marketing is kind of waiting on being able to scale into bigger pockets. Um, because they don't have the feedback and the signals back on purchases. So even probably quality bookings that should theoretically close are not being closed at a consistent basis. So it is hard for us to know where in marketing that's happening. And then financing percentage. I just want to throw this on here. We went from we had like a a I think we Yeah, it was a firm setup we were using. Um and we went from a very high percentage, not very high, but like sub 50, but in that range of how many people were financing and we changed up terms and some things on it and it dropped to like 5%. And that one definitely hurt even a couple units a day. So I am working to figure that out and change that because even if we get it dialed in the goal should be around 25% is kind of like what we hear. I actually don't know but like so comment if you can tell me what your percentage should be for the best LTV because I'm trying to solve for what is the best percentage amount on first on front end like high ticket purchases not front end as in like AOV but like your core product which is technically your back end I guess but like we're talking about back end back end um what percentage of that should be financed to where you get the best LTV so obviously you're going to match terms so you know a 12-month plan to a 12-month plan or this or that but what is the best percentage that you would be allowed to do to maximize front-end cash while also planning out for who actually turns into higher LTV. So, that's something we're like thinking through and how we can do that, what offerings we should do, how much we should pay in fees in order to get people the line, all that. Um, so yeah, so that's where we're at. Um, biggest thing in sales right now, hiring sales manager. We have three core ones that we're talking to right now. I think we just found one that's a rockar. We were trying to just figure out, you know, math and comp and get where it where it needs to be. But the second we get that dialed in, then these become the norm. So if these already days can just happen more or less, and then these days happen, it's like if we can just stabilize around these, which is easy with the current volume, or even less. Like some of these days are 20% less in bookings and still close out the same. We do that. We're at three. And then it's just pushing more volume swapping, making sure that the sales team is where it needs to be and that the marketing can the marketing will then get the signals to know to be able to scale into the right pockets, which is then from three to five pretty easy. And that's just an arbitrary number. It could be five or six. And then all at the same time launching everything on the back end which will change this global number. But usually what we've been talking is about 90% new cache. And this will change that that this new launch will change that math. So we will have likely a higher portion of like active or non-new um cash. That will be great because it'll be higher margin or gross margin. And yeah, so that's where we're at. There's my daily update. made a doc on here. Made a funny video yesterday of all of us just talking in the room, all sitting there in black t-shirts for some reason on accident from dinner. So, sorry if that was douchy or egoey or something. I didn't mean for it to be. I was just we were just trying to have fun. We all sit in the lobby. We're like, "Oh, we might as well just do this in the room next to us." So, www.rycl.comdoc has every video. I'm on day 49 or 50 or something in a row of doing these. I'm trying to find top talent that want to come work with us and build cool And yeah, just kind of want to be able to look back on these and say, "Oh, wow. We were at 1.6 and now we're at 10. So yeah, that's where we're at. And hit me on IG or X and watch some of the other fun videos. Talk soon. But
