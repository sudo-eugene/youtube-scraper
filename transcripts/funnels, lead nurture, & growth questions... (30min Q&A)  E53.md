# funnels, lead nurture, & growth questions... (30min Q&A) | E53
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfNKrhcwC34

In today's video, I'm going through all the questions you guys have submitted to the request box. I've not even reviewed these, so we're going to realtime answer. How to grow your coaching business. This doozy long one, live webinars, tracking show rates, video nurture funnels, a player closers, email stacks, all the things. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done 72 millionish. Uh now, I will update this on the next video. And I'm not selling anything. Everything is just showing in this channel what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. First one we have here, we run a coaching and agency business, dual focus. Uh, we're making 350K a month and the agency is 80% of the business. Cool. And we built a software in house. Okay. We also have a software triple split of focus uh to support the agency and to continue working with coaching clients after the first three or six months of training. Cool. We do not sell the software as a service. Okay. So maybe not as focus. And we have no intention to do so as that is our business mo. Cool. So use it on deliverable. Got it. It's on the fulfillment side, not on the sales side. Uh we get all of our clients from referrals and YouTube. Also great. Helps grow profit for the unit. And we never run any paid ads even if even if we're an advertising company. Okay. Well, kind of like the whole PRA practice what you preach, but is what it is. Uh, we can afford a CAC of 2K to achieve a lifetime gross profit, LTGP, uh, to CAC ratio of 15. Okay, so you're making 30-ish is what I'm going to get by that. So, you're making 30 in LTGP. The coaching business is more profitable and scalable, and we've seen lots of clients going from the coaching to the agency. And the coaching business is different from anything else in the market since they're all agencies. You're selling two agencies, built it off $100 million offer book, great book. Agency's AOV is 45,500 a month. Solid agency churn is sub4% which is great. The coaching's 20k for three months. That's solid. And 2.5 after that ascension rate 75% from coaching LTV. So from the 20k to the monthly, which is also good. And for the LTV for both is 45K. So quick math on that. 2K for CAC ratio to L to LTGP. So they're making 30G. So it's costing them 50 15K of the 45K to fulfill on the service and they're keeping 30 of it. If that math is quick and correct on my end or their end. Um bottleneck right now, here we go. Question is that we don't have enough booked qualified booked calls. If you would buy this business today, how would you 10x it? Who do you think we need to hire to fix this bottleneck? and how can I find talents talents like you? Um, all right. So, I'm I'm frankly I'm confused, but the bottleneck right now is that we don't have enough book calls. So, I think you're a marketing you're an advertising company, so you should be able to get qualified calls, I would think. Um, but let's say you don't know how to do that. Uh, so if you buy the business today, I will take 25% of this business, drop in my DMs, and I will do twice a month co coaching calls and steer you clear. Just kidding. But, uh, how would you 10x this because of that? And who would you hire to fix this bottleneck? I would hire a growth marketer to just take over that portion of the business and give them a percentage of the new stuff that comes in and just leave it as that. So you'd front ad spend. I mean you could even do without the percentage honestly and just time to row. I mean you already know your numbers. So keeping the CAC under 2K so set it at 1K 1.5 and 2K and give them bonuses and or performance fees to do that. But if you just need to generate enough book qualified calls, which makes me think that you also might not have the booked calls that you just in it sounds like you might have booked calls but not qualified ones. Uh which is then just basically how you're running them through the funnel. So if the framing is correct to get the qualifying. So simple simple example, but like don't click on this if you don't have over 200k or if you don't make over 200 grand. Aggressive but like an example. So that's an extreme but you could do that same thing with like if you're a landscaper click on this. If you're an agency owner that does over 100K a month, click on this. If you are not, do not click this. Do not click this. Have it in the headline. Have it in the VSSL. Have it in the application. That literally DQS them and does not allow them to complete the form unless it does. And then you just need to run volume increase ad spend. Again, right now it looks like you only do organic. So, make sure it's in all your organic and you're not just pumping out stuff to get views and you're actually doing it for your target audience. Um, but yeah, that's how I'd focus on that. So, who would you hire? I would just do that. And how can you find talent like me? Uh I am I have no idea. I don't know what to say about that. You you just find like I was I built through this. I was not found like this. I was found building random sales pages and then learned this on the job doing it. So it was more so a risk in the other direction of where my skill set was here and it became here over time and iteration, practice, implementation. So yeah, that's what I would do. But I would just hire a growth marketer. And if you're an agency, you already know agencies. So, I would literally just hire someone to do qualified book calls and directly tie the compensation to your CAC if you know your numbers. So simple. Um, how do you grow a coaching business? Very vague. I do not have an answer for you. Uh, I would need to submit another one that has more information on where you're at, where you're stuck, what the current situation is, and I can answer it similar to this one. Um, yeah, I have tons of videos on this channel that are all about growing it, that are about scaling it, that are about the cost behind it, that are about the team behind it, everything. So, I'll do that. Live webinars. So, this is actually interesting because in the video where we all were just at the event, the one we're all wearing black t-shirts. I don't know why, but we just are. It's a digital marketing thing, I think. Um, they talked about how they do live webinars and then they use aevent.com to do basically like uh what webinar jam or some of those other ones used to do to like basically make a live webinar pre-recorded and then auto webinar. A lot of people back in the day and still to this day uh would sell products up to 2K. They used to call it like the auto 2K webinar. Um because that's basically like statistically supposedly how high you could sell something automated through a webinar versus having to use a call funnel. Anything above 2K back in the day at least. I don't know. I'm not super privy to the direct toart game on the mid to high ticket. So live webinars, we don't do them anymore. Um we do them internal, but when those guys were talking about it, they were saying they do it post-purchase of a low ticket. And when they do that, it is basically like they buy a low ticket and it's like, oh, and you also get this bonus of this free master class. They push them through the master class, which is really just a VSSL pushing them, you know, selling them on the next thing in the ascension. Um, and they do that both included in the low ticket and then push throughout the product in the community. Other people do it directly in the front. There are big boy companies that do it in make money online space that do live webinars that sell a 2K product. Once they sell the 2K product, after that they will book them in with a setter and then uh as like an onboarding call, go through the full presentation, quick start guide, the whole thing. And then they will push them over to a closer if they're a good fit, qualified, and looking for more uh you know, higher likelihood of result, which is personalization, onetoone coaching, like all that kind of side. And that's the higher ticket. So you go from 2K to 9K or 10K or whatever. Um, and then we have actually run them in-house, but the only time we've or I'm sorry, not in-house, um, we've run them well, I guess, yes, in-house, but also we have run them to our communities before when we do launches. So, when we've done supplement launches, we've done them, uh, where we did a partnership. I made a video on that. We lost our ass. It was [ __ ] terrible. Um, but that was on us cuz I didn't do the math right. Now, I know math better. But, we do stuff like that when we do launches. We do stuff like that when we do like swag drops, which are not made meant to make money for us, but we don't have never done that to like directly sell something inside the community. Um, but yeah, so that's kind of our take on it. Uh, a lot of people love them, a lot of people use them. We likely will use them. A lot of people do them for live events, a lot of people do them for challenges. Uh, we just have not used those because of the complexity around them behind them. And for us, the model and the math works on our current setup. There's just been breaks in the chain of the funnel. It's not the actual like offer structure model that's broken. It's like pieces of them. So whether it's marketing is broken, not getting enough qualified calls, solve for it. Now you get enough calls that are qualified like clearly there. It's a closing issue. It's a sales issue, right? So, like there's different parts of just one simple funnel that can break. It's not necessarily the whole model or acquisition method like you're saying here live webinars that needs to happen or change. So, that's my opinion. Um, can you make a video going over tracking show rates? Know it sounds simple, but I find it super easy to track row CPL cost per call. What is the best way you found to track actual showing calls? I'm currently using pipeline stages. Yep, me too. Um, that if someone puts notes to show, it fires an automation and does it. Can you go over system? Okay, so this one I feel you on this. I know what you mean by this. So it is extremely common for this number to be a little gray area. So it's all data in data out. Now a no-show or a cancel generally speaking is it is required that you have a more or less manual input that occurs from the sales rep because that is the only person who knows if they no showed or canceled like directly. Now, they can send it through email or text or something and there could be like a timer trigger and like all these things, but to be honest with you, the absolute best way is a sales rep is marking it. Same way that a sales rep is marking in your deal stages if someone is a no-show. So, it's good inputs. You need good inputs, good data to have good outputs, which is that number and that uh that number you're looking for on a tracker. So, I actually track this in two ways. I have a manual tracker and I have an automated tracker that comes from the CRM. So, the manual tracker is like the classic like look at Cole Gordon's videos like he crushes they they're closers so all they do is sales. Um, not all they do. They do a million things and they're great. But I just mean like they're very focused on sales reps. That's their entire business. Um, so they have manual trackers that are basically like calls booked on day, calls taken, no show cancel, offer closed, and then like cash collected and whatever and like all these other things once that and then you have percents across. So imagine this, you have 100 calls on day. Those calls all come through as whatever your default deal stage. So for us that is call scheduled. You have 100 that come in on call scheduled. Okay? Now anything can happen to them. They can then become a no-show. They can become a cancel. They can become like all these other things. A hot listing, a long-term nurture, a deposit, a closed one or a closed loss, like disqualified, okay? Or a closed loss or a disqualified because they're kind of different because like one is you could have won, one is they they were not qualified. All you're going to do in the automated version is you're just going to take the no-show and cancel and you're going to get 30 on there or whatever the number is. Most more realistically, you're going to get 55 or something on there. And uh you are going to have that number that's going to automatically either be in a viewer that looks at your CRM database and can pull that uh on day so you know that there was a 100 calls that were booked for day. Then you're going to have by end of day there's going to be reschedules. So you're going to actually only have you know whatever it is. You're going to have 40 that were live call. You're going to have 40 that were in no show and cancel buckets and then you're going to have like 20 that were rescheduled call it. So you're going to have 80 and 40 and you're going to have a 50% show rate. Okay. So once they land in those buckets, you're able to tell like where they went from there and you want to take basically and then on the manual one it's the exact same thing. It's how many calls were on day and then how many were no show cancel. So you sub those out 100 you sub those out. So there was 60 calls that were actually taken of the initial 100 that were booked and that is like the inverse of that essentially is your show. So I do it like you know minus basically and then divided across and I have it on both and they're like very very similar like there's small fluctuations. One will say 56, one will say 55.2. who and again both of them are reliant on a sales rep manually adjusting either the deal stage or the tracker for their daily tracker. Um some are easier for some teams, some are not. Uh we always just like to always have a uh sheet as well as the CRM because it's helpful in there, but it sounds like you're already doing it correct. Like it fires an automation. Only thing with firing an automation is a lot of times if you fire an automation into like a sheet, it just logs it one time and it's like oh this person no showed. but it's like the person could accidentally click it and then change it right after and it wouldn't adjust in your sheet. So that's why databases and like CRM are cool because they're real time. So like your chart would realtime change. It could go back and forth versus if you're logging them into a sheet, which it sounds kind of like you are. Um Oh yeah, because you literally said it. Um then yeah, it it likely you want like a live viewer. You don't want a logger that you are manually doing because every time something changes it doesn't update there. CRUD is what it's called. So, can you do a breakdown of a video nurture funnel? What is a video nurture funnel? The idea uh being you build the funnel within Facebook. So, you have top of funnel videos that capture 95% of the watchers first, calls out your niche offer. Middle of funnel videos, I assume still on Facebook, nurtures and builds trust. And then bottom of funnel is a VSSL to book a call funnel. I find that my product specifically needs a ton of trust. And I've had a hard time getting people to book a call and just pay a high price. Okay. So, you're talking about instead of having any pages, you're talking about having basically three buckets of people. Top of funnel, middle of funnel, bottom of funnel, bottom of funnel. I don't know if any of those words made sense, but you know what I mean. Uh, all on Facebook, which is very interesting because you never own the data. All you have is pixel data on that or or even like that. It's all you have is audiences that you can build from the pixel uh from the video view data and you're never sending them to your site by how it sounds like you're doing, which I don't do. We don't do. So, I understand the theory. I know people who run 10-minute VSSLs on Facebook on platform, like natively on platform, send them to a low ticket, convert like crazy. Josh was talking about that in the video where he has a friend that does, you know, 50K a day profitally on the front end doing that style of model. Um, we do not do that really. Like we have tested and done longer form videos. We definitely do it with testimonials or like kind of like compilation videos. um we have never at scale ran we've tried actually I know we've tried but like we've never run the full VSSL on platform uh for an extended amount of time so I don't know why you would want to do that and not own the data I mean I assume you're trying to go for a cost because you're trying to go for like video views and you're trying to just ramp it there so you can decrease the cost but like the economics work sending them off platform so I don't know why you wouldn't um I mean sure try it but all you would do is you would run a bunch of those on the top and then you'd have exclusion audiences. So like once someone does that, they only see the other videos and then like down the funnel. So that's like the same way that Jeremy Haynes puts in his videos, the hammer them strategy or like they were talking about that roundt video I uploaded about how you can do it for content on the front end prele, I'm sorry, pre- booked call, just do it with leads and they're just video view campaigns with no links. And the idea is once someone watches has a through play of one, you exclude them from that so they don't see the same video. So they're basically just seeing different videos of you over and over and over with like a 20, you know, 20x frequency across the campaign. That's like the general gist. So you're basically talking about doing that. And he talks about this actually. Go watch Jeremy Haynes's videos. He's so much better at this. And like he runs the actual ads. I don't run the ads. I just understand the concepts kind of. Um, but he talks about one, I'm totally blanking. It's like the fly trap, like the Venus fly trap method. And it's like this. It's like step one, then step two, then step three, and you walk them through the videos on platform. So he actually does do this. and then pushes them there. If your issue is a ton of trust, um trust is basically that their belief in you to get them the result. So that's case studies, that's testimonials, that's authority, like positioning, that's all of that. Um there are people that run ads direct and then also consumption once you get them. So getting their emails and then being able to remarket to them both through email and ads and continue to help them and continue to offer value to them builds trust. Uh so if you can do that through lead magnets and then just continue to market to them through those platforms with just more content, more value, do it through free courses, free stuff, things you normally, you know, sell, just giving to them. Like that's how you build trust, not just make them watch a bunch of stuff over and over on platform. Like that just kind of like gets them in front of you. I would, you know, I mean, I guess it's both, especially if we're providing value in the videos, but yeah, I would do that. Um, and then same with us, you know, we do an opt-in on a lot of our stuff and the ones we go direct to app on have a lower show rate and a lower close rate. Math, economics are like better, so like it makes it so it can it can get close to working. But we do the volume game for that specifically. So, we can do nurture, we can push them back to the site, we have tons of content on site, we offer them free courses, free stuff, and then when they're ready, they basically upgrade themselves. So, hope that answers. Go check about go check out har Jeremy Haynes I cannot speak Sunday night. Uh what makes an a player closer and how are you I able to identify that in the hiring process. It's the hungry one. I mean in the hiring process I mean that's a little tougher like you can kind of tell who's got it at some level and I haven't done direct hiring for this in like three years. So we used to hire we used to be the sales team and then we hired the sales team and then we managed the sales team and then we hired in managers for the sales team and then I have not been on the process of hiring or managing a sales rep since. So this is old news. Um these are yeah this is old. So but how I hear about it in operations teams and meetings and stuff is like you can just tell right you can tell and then once they're in everyone's running the same gambit. Everyone has the same like access to resources and tools. So the ones that stand out are the ones who identify themselves, who who stick out on their own and then putting resources behind them, identifying stuff and being identifying pieces that they can work on, making sure they have all the things that they need to do their job the best. And you can just tell they're just the hungry ones. They're the ones who aren't saying, "Oh, do I have a, you know, what's my minimum amount of calls I should have?" It's the ones who are pushing for the maximum. It's the ones who are opening the slots who see the opportunity and just absolutely grab it and just run. So I hope that answers. Um, again, not my super sweet spot, but for that, I would go to Cole Gordon. He's got a ton of videos on page that are all about that on YouTube. What does your email text stack look like in the back end for your opt-in application submissions between call reminders, nurturing, etc. What platform do you use to trigger emails based on different pipeline stages? Um, I've made an entire video on this. I think the thumbnail is where it's like lead to app to booking to close. And I basically talk about the different automations and what occur between them. Uh, for what platform do we use? is we use HubSpot for everything. So, HubSpot is our CRM on the sales, marketing, and a little bit of fulfillment side. Um, not super yet, but and like all of our data management. So, the email stack is that and then it's basically when they hit these different events and triggers, they get uh different properties at the contact level. So, in CRM, I have so many videos about these and you can look on the if you go to this uh www.rronclug.comdoc actually it's down here. this I have these broken down and in these I put like you'll be able to see which ones are which because this one is just these are the like you know clickbaity titles and this is what they actually are. Um so you'll be able to find one there like communication flow for the VSSL funnel like this one shows that. So basically you're you're putting a property in that says like when they achieved each event. So like an opt-in, an application, a booking uh um booked, what date did they book, what did they book for, and then when they purchased. And then you can identify like when they have this but not this. send them these emails. As soon as they have an application but not a booking, send them these emails. When they have a booking but not a purchase, send them these emails. And like you can pull them from list and add them to other automations easily um from that. So that's not really on pipeline stages. It's like a lead stage or like a lead where they're currently at in the funnel. Um hopefully that answers that. But what event do you optimize for? A lead or a schedule? Uh we don't do anything on lead. So Blake talked about this a little bit, but basically when you're launching one, you're optimizing for whatever you can get 50 conversions on in a week. So you can start to train the pixel. Uh, and that's from like scratch scratch. Uh, we optimize. So we have native events. So it's lead, submit application, schedule, and then purchase. Um, submit application and schedule only fire on the quality ones. So even though if they come through, the application routes them to different pages. And we only pushed back to Facebook the quality ones for submit application and schedule and then purchase. all of them are quality. Um, and then we don't know enough on a lead level, so all the leads come through. We optimize for schedule and we optimize for purchase and we do a mix of that. We keep a majority of ours purchase, but we have had major issues with our pixel and Facebook. That's why our acquisition exploded back when it did um because of this because we were unable to consistently generate bookings for the sales team. Um, and when we optimized for schedule, it was a way lower rate. It was a way lower quality, way lower close rate. Um and then when we optimize for purchase, they were getting capped and they were not fully spending and then you don't get enough purchases. It doesn't feed back signals. So then it continues to happen in like a vicious spiral down. Uh so yeah, so we had a lot of issues with this but in current state we run about call it 80% purchase 20% schedule. We want to run more on schedule. It is cheaper but it directly is like a correlate to cheaper is also lower show also lower quality. Um, so we're trying to play like a a we're trying to dance the line here on like how to keep enough volume while also just optimizing for quality people. So we're trying to retrain our schedule to make it so it's the highest tier quality people. So get the economics of a schedule but get the rorowaz of a purchase. So we're constantly playing this game and dancing with that. But hope that answers. And then same thing with low ticket. We optimize for a purchase. If you want a purchaser, optimize for a purchaser. and then just hope and pray you can get your volume and your cost in the correct thing and that the attribution comes back within the window because that's a big thing with call funnels. Um, and yeah, so also my video is skipping. I never backed up my Mac, so I still haven't moved to my new one, but sorry about it. Um, how to lead your team effectively and how do you keep your sales reps motivated after the first six months? How do you keep your entire team on the growth mindset and hungry? Now, I notice excitement can fade. Correct. Excitement can fade for you. Excitement can fade for your team. Excitement fades. completely. So the vision does not the cast out and the growth and progression does not. So that is a direct measurable that is easy to see that is easy to feel. Um so for the sales rep portion at least how do you keep them motivated after the first six months? It is known that there's like a lull that happens for sales reps and again this is not my zone of expertise. Please go watch like a Cole Gordon or some of these guys that like absolutely crush with this. Um Josh Joshua Troy talks about this. Um, it's a known thing that sales reps hit this pe like basically start to get, you know, they're human beings, right? They're not just like production machines and they have waves that they hit and when they hit a certain point or have been doing something for a long enough of time, it is very common for them to have troughs and how do you navigate that in the emotions. Go watch those guys videos. They're going to help you way more than I'm going to help you with that. But it is natural and it's going to happen everywhere. It's going to happen in your fulfillment. It is going to happen in your HR. It is going to happen in your finance team. maybe lesser because it's less uh banging your head against a wall that it might happen with a sales rep. Um but they're emotional. They're emotional beings and that's how they can navigate these conversations in a good way and also have these laws. So how do you keep the entire team on a growth mindset and hungry? Um I think aligning incentives is big. So I think them knowing that when the entire team helps each other and they dominate in their scope, so call it marketing or call it sales, right? they dominate in their role. They know they're going to get paid. And then also knowing that the rest of the team is in some relation way getting paid the same or getting paid in the same way when these other departments succeed is big. So you don't have to do that through a profit share pool, but there are ways to incentivize comp or tie the incentives to one another. Quick example of this marketing. So right now I'm talking basically how you keep the growth and hunger for the ops team. So like a marketing a lead of marketing can make x amount of dollars as base and then they can make a performance percentage that is based on call it net CPA. Now net CPA is all good and dandy. You can be the best marketer in the world but if you're running a sales team or a sales call funnel and the sales team isn't closing the net CPA will never be in alignment. So they have you know a horse in that race uh to make sure that the sales team is doing well. So it's tying the comps together right in that way. Same thing that sales has a rate has a horse in the race of marketing because if they don't have enough bookings they can't hit the volumes and they can't hit their incentive pace because they get paid as a percentage of net new rev. Um the fulfillment side of things is based on volume that comes from the sales team which comes from the marketing team and then also managing costs within there but if they need to pay their team XYZ to keep afloat they have to pay more per client because they don't have the new inflow. So they're also in the sales and marketing thing. So, it's basically making making sure everyone's comp and stuff is tied together so you always have that team um and everyone's driving towards the same thing. So, that's both the vision thing and then also just like a straight up financial thing um that you can drive behavior with. But every time they do studies, it's like, you know, the third or fourth most important thing is finances and the rest is like to feel valued, to feel like what they're doing is contributing, to make sure that what they're doing feels like progression. Like that's my goal of everything I do is just progression. Um just to feel the progression and feel like you're winning in that way. So hopefully that helps. But yes, excitement can fade, but habits do not. So how do you gain connections and contacts at the very beginning when you have nothing? Do I am the worst person to ask this question. Literally the worst person ever. Uh I have no connections and contacts or I had none until I started doing this. So I literally lived in a cave, didn't talk to anyone. I didn't I couldn't name I mean I could name because I knew who they were, but like they had no idea who I was uh in info and coaching space or really any space. Um I have never been one to really do that. uh in the last at least like 10 years I haven't or more. Um so how do you gain you are valuable? You put out stuff. You show that you're working on things. You do it raw. You are who you you are you to your core. You're not faking [ __ ] and people can tell that in two seconds. Uh so yeah I mean I think just being that I think buying courses and being communities I've bought you know simplest example. This is actually funny but like before I even started doing these I seriously had like zero. I had like the people I worked with and like original family, friends, girlfriends, stuff like that. And that was about it. And now I have hundreds of people that I can talk to that are in this like sector of online business. Uh the info coaching world and a little bit of lead genen affiliate and even those, you know, they're not there's not too much depth to them yet, but like I do have the contacts, I do have the connections and it's working. So, you know, me looking for talent opportunities and network is directly working from this. So me just sharing like where we're at in the trenches. And it has nothing to do I mean like it doesn't matter what the number is, doesn't matter if it's 100 million, doesn't matter if it's a million, doesn't matter if it's 10,000. Like there are literally groups on Twitter called build in public of everyone who's at zero dollars in cash collected and they have a band of people around them that are all supporting each other. It's like it's just a shared vision. Back to even like the last question and shared values on what you're doing um and just being a real person and doing that. So yeah, I think uh I think it's easy to do when you have nothing. I think it's actually maybe easier to do depending just by finding people who are in your space and then picking out the couple people that are maybe above that are willing above. I even [ __ ] hate saying that but above in terms of what your goal is or closer to the goal that you are trying to achieve. So, and then I've also met people in communities and groups. So, where I was going with that story and then I [ __ ] yapped uh is I bought a like memecoin trading whatever telegram thing and I just got in there and on and just started throwing Nate like talking about this and this and this and I had like 10 people I would talk to like all day every day when we were just like in the trenches for 18 hours a day just like making tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars like back and forth doing this and like it was just funny and fun. Is that real life and like real world connections? No. But like great example of like if you buy these courses and communities, you already now have a shared align vision. You're trying to start an AI agency. you're trying to become an online coach, consultant, you're trying to do marketing for landscapers, like any of those things, you already have that shared vision if you buy into something. Same way that if you're on a sports team, you have a shared vision, you have a shared interest already. Same way that if you are in XYZ place and town or whatever, you have shared something already. So, it's basically just choosing what type of things are important to you and then getting around people that have the same things that are important to them um that what they're going for. So, what do you last one? What do you look for when hiring an a when hiring a copywriter? Thought that was a grade a uh copywriter. And what would you say copyriters who what would you say to copyrighters? You think AI would replace them? All right, let's start there. I would think that copyriters already have been a large portion replaced. I was just at that event and there was a guy who owned a large copyrightiting company and basically said he's just like shutting it down and pivoting portions of it because they already got taken by AI. I didn't really know if I believe that or not and we'll see. Um, but it's basically who can use the AI. So, if copyriters can use it, there are guys who are crushing this right now, like Mario something, uh, Stephan Georgie, like those guys were on AI the second it was right there to use it in copyrightiting and just like essentially used it if you watch any my other videos to like decrease their fulfillment time and costs um, and just still charge the same thing. So, to my understanding, so you can fact check that, but the idea being that they just made them more efficient at their job, but they're still the best in the world. They still know what is the best in the world. they still know what works and AI got them 80% of the way there. So then they could do five times the amount of project load for the same amount of dollars assuming maybe a little bit less but you still did five times the amount of [ __ ] for the same cost or yeah now for the same cost to you. So um what do I look for in a copywriter results? I'm at the point now where I look for like experience. So if people are doing it or have done it, I want to see that they have. I like to know they've done it in the industry. I like to know they've done it in the space where they're already selling to that market. They know it's important. Um, there are people who go really, really deep in this and I think those have proven time and time again to be the best. You know, there's a ton in the Alen Sultanic Nothing Held Back group. Those guys are like so good. Um, I'm not a copywriter at all. When AI came out, it like saved my life because I could get 80% of the way there and post something live and a copyriter could come in and clean it. Before that, I had to come up with words or just funnel hack someone and copy paste and change [ __ ] and that was not ideal. Um, so yeah, I'm basically looking for a copywriter uh who has the experience, who has the results, who does it in a fair compensation way and who is smart to be efficient but not do it in a way that they charge XYZ mass amount, not based on results and then take 12 minutes to do it via AI. It's like that arbitrage is not there. The arbitrage is between the results and the time or money it cost the person to do it. Um, so hopefully that makes sense. I was going to take notes while I did that, but that ended up being 30 minutes. Apologies kind of. Um, so here is where you can submit more of these. I'll do these like every weekish. Um, I want to keep these kind of like high level if possible. Not high level. I want to go deep into them, but I don't really want like beginner e and these didn't feel like beginner ones. So, I feel good about that. Daily update. All these are in the dock. I just hit 51, I think, in a row. So, today should be 52, I believe. But that's what I got. Hit me on X. Hit me on IG and we will talk soon. Have a good week.
