what's up everybody all right so today we're going to go into the quarterly meeting agenda that we use at our company that did 30 million in cash collected last year whole point of this channel is me just sharing what we're doing what we have done before and how we are operating to scale to 100 million a year in cash collected so let's get into it um all right so first things first attendees so I we actually operate this entire thing out of a clickup board um that's like the different meetings then they can all get uh queued into there and connect to each other and have like shared but for this I'm just going to use a Google doc so first things first attendees all right so for us it's going to be our CEO chief of people customer success sales director senior Tech lead Chief technology operating this is technically me we don't have a defined one for this yet which is kind of funny but uh Chief marketing and outbound director all right so I'm going to facilitate it and let me just show you on the org chart that I made I made this specifically for these again this is our active one but so essentially CMO who's going to lead all of this Chief Tech is currently me and I kind of sit more right here but that's its own thing uh senior Tech lead because he is a rockstar and is going to lead all of Tech into the future sales director is currently our closure manager as well like acts as both so this outbound director is actually this Setter manager same thing um and outbound director uh they're basically both like sitting here so they're both in operational decisions and customer success manager and chief of people they are too so the goal being that these right here that are kind of like in an or chart sense uh like a second layer down actually are going to more or less be operating their own Department okay so this currently does report to here but because it has such a standalone um like division same with Setter has their whole own Standalone closer their own Standalone and then Tech eventually these will fully R run their own department and for us the whole point of Ops is like that's why I kind of joke that this is like my current role is basically just facilitating them because we have such strong leaders that they fully run their own department so to have like a COO title or whatever ever I mean we can put whatever we want on it but basically as long as us as a team are deciding at the operational level what we need to get done the kpis the quarterly goals like backing into all that stuff and are reporting essentially to each other in that meeting they do have a direct report right we do still all go up to CEO in some capacity like on one to ones um but for the sake of actually making decisions and then executing on them these are all extremely strong leaders that can do that that can already do that within their division and don't need like too much handholding so that's a general gist of who is going to be on it and again I will facilitate it so this is a blend of a few things like mainly this is on the EOS framework um it's kind of like a hybrid is of that not because I think we can do it better just because how we're currently operating necessarily isn't ready for full EOS um and then another person who has a really good video what's his name um Ravi avula made a really good video about this and his is actually super similar to ours uh and we I I just uh put this in here from him because we used to have this up higher on ours um but we've always done this and then the org chart one is new to us already and then we've always used these so here's the general agenda um but go check out his channel his stuff fantastic so personal wins and setting expectations um so we already do this and uh all of our other meetings so we have an operations meeting that's already on weekly Cadence and what we do is right now it's March 24th 2025 so this meeting is tomorrow on our normal Tuesday Ops meeting except we make it an hour and a half or two hours depending and then it's for the coming quarter so this is for starting in April the Q2 okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do the personal wins basically just break the ice everyone talk about what amazing things happened in their life and then I will set the expectations of the meeting okay so I've already set this out and I'll send you the pre I'll I'll put the pre in here and we can go over that but I've sent this out to the team so these two have never been in operations yet on our operations meeting in terms of our actual like the channel um or in obviously any of the quarterly stuff so what we're going to do or on any of the meetings so tomorrow will be their first meeting then from then will include them in uh in our operations Channel which is where all like bigger decisions are made and conversation is um and then they will also now be on the weekly Cadence for all operations meetings going forward so thus far it's just been this and if you scale way back it was like you know basically two of us three of us and then it has scaled to this but now we're adding these two okay and both of them are just like unbelievable at their jobs in their role and come with experience which is amazing so personal wins and setting expectations um once we're there we're going to go into this kind of because of the these guys are new on the team so Luke's going to do uh or CEO is going to do where we've been and where we're going so we were doing 10 million two years ago last year we did 30 million 3x we broke everything here's what happened and our next goal is direct response heavy low ticket fully optimized sales system and over 100 million right like that type of gist but for 10 minutes going through all of that and I have this whole thing slotted out with like how much time and my job is to facilitate and make sure that stays on that okay review values and Mission um Ravi on his video had a good point of updating these and uh in this meeting for us with kind of who's on the team right now and the current state like these are pretty solid for us they're already relatively freshly updated um so we're going to keep these as is for now so this is just going to be reviews make sure that everyone again is up to speed knows where we stand know what is important to us and where we're going in the mission uh q1 data this is all me so this is I have live dashboards that I wish I could show you but I just again too much like privacy information on them but the q1 data is going to be for us specific too we have like an overall company one that goes all the way down to profit um that we'll be sharing so like where we at this month where we at quarter to date uh in comparison to last year in compar like across all these ranges um and then same thing with sales and marketing data because those are kind of like the big pillar ones uh we do use a weekly scorecard and I can go into the weekly Cadence we have later but we use a weekly scorecard that has important metrics for every basically Department of this so like for tech for example it's like how many custo or uh support tickets occurred like internal support tickets so where things could could be automated where there opportunities what was the percentage error rate of our AI system that we use for SMS um on sales it'll be like units bookings all that CS how many escalations like uh you know almost refunds or like requested refunds and then how many actually turned into refunds or not uh or cancellations so stuff like that um but for this one it's a little bit broader stroke like entire company q1 data and really focus on like cash right cash in cash out and then the metrics across uh not as much the operational data all right then review and update the or chart I just kind of showed you a v probably 13 of this but this one and I'll have an update on that um because we're kind of basically trying to determine some of the sales piece uh me honestly and then kind of where this flows and then what else the CMO will need and what the timeline is for that um this Department's already pretty good it just Grows by units so that is that and then Rock review and creation so for us what we do again this is eos model you can look I think it's a Gino Wickman traction um but essentially Rocks Our quarterly goals simply put so we already have our q1's so we're going to review these pretty quick but again because these two weren't here they don't have anything for that yet so they're just listening and just getting up to date and getting to where we are um and then creation of them so this like basically the biggest portion of the meeting for us um a lot of people do this section but for us in this specific meeting we're going to do a big portion here so I already have numbers in mind and already have them pre-written for what I think our targets are in terms of like cash collected Target for Q2 uh in terms of row as Target on new row as uh retention metric like these different pieces I already have slotted so I want to come together with a team and have them come to those understanding and pick the numbers together that what they think is realistic and then back into it so let's say it's 3 million a month right so if our unit is XYZ like let's just say so for 3 million back into it how many new units is that that's 400 new units a month okay so 400 new units if you're selling a 10% sales per booking is 4,000 book calls if you have 4,000 book calls marketing needs what $200 a booking so you're going to spend 800 Grand in ads but like backing into all of those and then making it so it's realistic for them across the quarter so that was a monthly example um but we'll break those down and then same things with the actual projects that occur so the goal being we come to with the actual metrics more so already in mind and then it's one of the actual projects and one of the pieces that need to get done and then assigned out to to divisions which are essentially people um and departments on what they will handle so um I'll break that down in the pre-meeting section but so that is the biggest piece of this and then IDs this is like a rolling never ending list it's like a parking lot thing a lot of people overuse that but it's uh I guess I'll included but it is just like constant idea generation that goes into a massive list things that need to be uh they've already been identified we're then going to discuss them and solve and assign out so they sit in this just like bucket of open on clickup is what we use um then we talk about them and they get moved into to-do with who submitted it uh who is like the champion of it and then any other details get included in the clickup uh task and then uh get assigned out like a due date essentially so they'll pop into to-do then then go to in progress and complete so everything from let's run a new internal review campaign because that'll feed this and the whole goal whole goal is it is a waterfall so you're going to have your annuals which we already have but like because of how we're shifting things it's kind of like we're already kind of adjusting our annual goals just after q1 and the changes we had and who we're deciding to hire and how we're deciding to transition the company so this is like a really key meeting for us because of everything that's going to change in Q2 three and four so for Q2 we will then look and say okay what else needs to happen in here um so like I said the reviews one for example um let's say for Setters it's 30% of Revenue we want to come from Setters like what needs to happen there where can we Implement AI in Tech um so pieces there now pre- meeting and we're kind of talking about what already happens here so I just want to jump to this so for pre-meeting this is what we sent out oops so prepare to talk about updates from your rocks for q1 this is what they basically need to come with and they saw this whole thing already um so it's prepare to talk about updates on your rocks from q1 so essentially just this part of the team already has their rocks and each one has three to five maybe of their quarterly goals so were they complete were they not we talk about this every week in the monthly update so we already kind of know them so this part's pretty quick and then it's which one of them either need to get carried forward or canceled so if something didn't get it's either it's completed it needs to get carried forward into Q2 because it didn't and why didn't it because it should have been right most of the time unless there's some sort of block and then um uh completely canceled in some way right so different things change we don't need a whatever new accounting system or something right now because it's just not priority and we're just going to cancel it for now and revisit later and then this is the big piece so having everyone ready everyone including all the new team uh to go through Rock review and creation and I just gave some examples so we want everyone to come with two to five specific Department specific goals for Q2 so for marketing let's say it's a blended net CPA of 1500 right because now we're running low ticket so there's like a net aspect where we can offset it with uh liquidation uh using low ticket items uh like I said earlier 30% new rev from Setter claimed okay what needs to happen there and these are already going to be talked about at the broader scope and then broken down into the different individuals but this is more so the non-broken down Parts I guess is an easy way to say it so like this for example source of Truth data migrated for Tech we want to move all of our Tech stack completely inside one source of Truth uh right now we're planning on using HubSpot to where we use all the custom tables and databases and things inside there because it exists in a multitude of places everything works great and is like scalable but like you have to go too many places to look for things you can't query things against each other without combining them in other places so where is this really going to fall in we want to do 3 million a month and we want to do this we want to do this and like in calls and rowes it's not but like it's still important for the company and in a different way right so hopefully that's the goal of Tomorrow is to come up with all these and then same thing with this like 10 reviews weekly Evergreen okay so like how do we get 10 reviews a week how do we do that in through an evergreen system we'll just throw this on here and then customer success can back into okay where are the places I can get it I can get it from uh email signatures I can get it from uh client requests I can get it from MPS score or MPS requests like all these different places and then they can handle that outside of the meeting okay but as a team we're going to decide these so this is a general gist it'll about an hour and a half um and I can report back kind of how it goes this is our first one with this crew um the last one we did was an annual planning meeting where it was a full day where everybody here uh basically came with like a their strengths their weaknesses the company because of them like what parts of them are thriving the company and not what their goals are at an annual basis and we did that in person and that was really good but for these quarterly ones we just do them over Zoom so I will update you on how this goes and again I got a ton of uh inspiration on this from EOS initially and then I added a couple pieces from Ravi that was on there um this is basically the format that we've always ran them and that's it so drop any comments comment um or DM on Instagram if you have any questions or want any topics specific and we'll talk soon soon
