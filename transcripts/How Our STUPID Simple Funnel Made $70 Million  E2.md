# How Our STUPID Simple Funnel Made $70 Million | E2
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuYX_Ag4Px0

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the vssl call funnel overview so all the links and funnel pages and how they flow together um that we used to do $70 million in cash collected so whole goal of this uh is basically just to document and show what's working for us now uh we're constantly breaking things constantly room for improvement but this is what we have used um to do these numbers and kind of what we're adjusting and changing as these videos go on um and where we're optimizing so current state right now uh majority of our traffic comes from Facebook it's 85% or so of our spend on a daily basis um so you can see kind of all the ads here but a lot of video ads um with multiple brand faces now which is a new thing that we are testing um because for the longest time it was just uh One Singular brand face who's one of the co-founders of the company um and is in all the marketing assets so testing out right now different brand phases but essentially mainly Facebook traffic all going to an opt-in page okay so the vssl flow that we use is just first name email on opt then going to a vssl page I'll show you what this is in the bonus uh bonus and training replay so optin name email video sales letter application that's like 16 1 questions I'll show you booking page get on a zoom call all right so this is where they're opt in right now we just click name email then all the workflows behind them they'll then go to the actual vssl page these are constantly being split test so this is like a variation one for example or the control um so here's going to be the desktop version and then mobile is a vitic version so one's on wish we're actually changing that over right now because we heard that uh it has way higher clicks and better um better results when you use desktop so or I'm sorry when you use vitic on desktop uh so for that looping video but only about 10% of the traffic currently uh shows up on desktop and a majority of it is mobile so we're already pretty optimized there so I watch this There's a sticky CTA here or a cookie CTA that'll basically um pop up when they get to the uh CTA level of the video so it's like basically like 80 90% of the way through the video it'll pop up here and say click here to apply now x amount of limited spots they will end up on this page right here to apply this is also the main CTA that's all over our actual site so if you pop on to the actual site you'll see these apply Nows everywhere so this is the main call to action on the public side of the site we actually don't route them to the free training in current state we might change that up in the future um but currently every single apply now is going to bring you also to this page so so people can essentially enter here or here right so come through opt which is all of our traffic almost um all the paid traffic and then uh they can enter through here through organic through um just consumption based on the site so you're going to click through here I'm not going to go through the whole app but essentially the framing uh we got from alen sultanic which is taking them from like current state and then bringing them basically into state of pain so like state of like to get them in the frame that by the time they book a call they're realizing that they need help and they they can't do this on their own um so we collect a lot of good information through this um and then we also added newly somewhere in here we added a financial qualifier this is new to us so this probably only the last 5,000 or so applications we have where we're we're testing this based on routing um so this will say basically they say less than 1K depending on how much calendar availability it'll either allow them to book but not pixel Facebook um or send it back to the Facebook pixel or if they are um less than 1K depending and our calendars are full booked or like limited space uh it'll route them to a low ticket and just DQ them um but either way this does not cook the Facebook pixel which is an issue in thing that we Tred started probably two months ago uh that we've never had before so we've done like close to 400,000 applications through this and a variation of this form um so from there once they apply they then land on a booking page right here uh we're constantly split testing this with copy and the big thing we're testing here is not only the booking conversion rate so the app to booking percentage but we're also testing the uh actual backed out like r Revenue per booking that comes from each page because if you think if you have this zero friction then you're going to get more calls theoretically that are going to come through so you're going to have a higher conversion but maybe it's more Tire kickers just people who aren't as um uh who aren't as committed to this so all the micro commitments that we try and get throughout this process and like actually stop people um and add some friction so we do this on purpose um and then they come in they book a call and then once they're done booking a call they land on the success page and and we basically say hey we're going to call you from a 610 number we have a call confirmation team that's like 20 217 so they literally don't work three hours a day across the entire ever um so they call them and confirm them uh during working hours and then let them know to zoom make sure they're on uh that we're going to email and text them about it make sure that they're on a computer prior video check out these Transformations and then watch these reviews right and then all the email followup is constantly pushing them back to this so going back to this that's like the general direct flow right so someone could opt in they watch the vsl they apply they book a call and then there's the thank you page of the booking okay so the ones that are in between these are essentially used in uh both ads as well as an email followup we have a ton of email followup so like between this and this we'll have un applied I'm sorry an oped an opt no app workflow and then between this and this we'll have an app notbook workflow and then between booking and uh actual call we'll have a booking nurture workflow right so this is obviously going to be the biggest volume these are going to be contextual because now we have we can do SMS as well because we collect phone number for the first time in application um and then booking before the actual call nurture them with pre block just more consumption getting them to watch reviews um getting them to watch videos that are not directly saying XYZ objection but basically like getting it out of the way so um trying and get ahead of that versus it happening on the 30- minute Zoom call um but then yeah so these two pages right here says boning training replay page where did I click these there we go oops no I didn't let's just click on so this one so this is going to be what they get sent in email that um so basically if they watch the vssl it says hey if you stay until the end of the vsl we're going to give you all these free bonuses um then you have to claim in through your email so they open the email so you get higher s email goes up um because they open those and then they're linked over here to this bonus page where it's just says bonus at the bottom you push again the BSL that's right here so it like forces consumption especially on mobile um which again is like 85% of our traffic so this page is actually ugly I got to change that see constantly learning uh we just moved over to web flow so didn't see this but um coming down here they have to go through all these reviews basically see them before they get down here to see these different bonuses yeah like this is so ugly I didn't even know this but now we know um so in here they can then these are our main four buyer personas so the bonuses are in alignment with that so basically uh menopause uh hormonal style uh busy mom basically I don't have enough time stop over training the people who just try and like work out like crazy cardio bunny um and or just like overtrain in general and then back which is like the core one um a lot of the time that we use in our assets and also is like the most highly claimed so we push them here through email and then it's basically just like a retar is you could call it page that we are putting them back into so they claim their bonuses get more consumption all the bonuses are filled with you know apply here apply here Pages um or CT more so and then same with these pages right here um to always just constantly try and get them to apply okay so again this is going to exist in this opt no app workflow so as soon as they watch the vsl and opt in it waits the 25 30 minutes and it sends them this we'll actually instantly we send them an email and I'll go through another video actually on this that goes through all the different workflows but they will get the instant like hey you opted in here's your free training link and then after the 30 minutes or so we send it to everyone even not just the people who got to the end of the vsl because you can track that and it's we do track that but we just figure it's better to send to everyone so we send it to everyone that's watched uh or opted in for the vssl after the end time in the vssl we say oh hey here all your free bonuses thanks for watching blah blah blah and we send them this page right here um so that's there and then the other page I want to show you was the one that we used for retarget and we actually were using for a lot of the Google stuff for a while um we've never fully cracked Google working on that right now but the max we've ever spent there is like two to 4K a day maybe like even scaled up um and a lot of it's branded search branded camps stuff like that um we've never hit it on cold and never hit it on YouTube at scale so we're trying to do that now but we will use this page right here on retarget and then also sometimes so retarget on ads retarget in um or retarget whatever you want to call it nurture and emails and then we've been using that in Google a little bit um but again mainly for retarget and not so much cold so this is more of like a Al sultanic kind of vibe where um for the automatic clients like low ticket thing except for us it's just push into an application um so this is the longer form prettier page as you can see these are the newer pages are looking way better cuz we're constantly finding things like I need to change this now this is terrible so um but yeah so getting closer and closer to just a full branded nice design that goes through there so I'll go through other videos um that go deeper into the workflows and everything like that but again these videos are just to like show what we're doing um I found a video going back that was showing what we did when we were only doing 10ish million I think we'd only done like whatever 8 to 12 million in cash collected on this funnel and it's me going through and the platform Evolution and all that stuff and it's just like I wish I would have shared it cuz then we did 60 million through the updated version that I never up like shared so yeah um all things Tech tracking um systems automations team everything that's evolved since then I'm going to try and figure out a clean way to write it out and share it as here and then as we evolve because like right now one of the big things we're changing and we're pushing towards is like uh Setters we've never had Setters um low ticket and those two go in in uh in tandem kind of of like because you're going to have Setters uh take basically the implementation calls free otos that is on the back end of the load ticket so you're routing people through so then increase show rates increase quality um as well as obviously quality because they're a low ticket so they've already become a purchaser versus a lead so we've never done stuff like this a scale um and we keep hearing that this is crazy M crazy uh math to have gotten to at these rates without doing all these things that we didn't even know really were a thing uh for our maret market so or didn't really think to do and want to change Focus so yeah that's kind of the goal is uh just document what we're doing uh as of date currently today in March of 2025 we are only running this vssl funnel still um and then we're like a week or two out from having Setters having um low ticket that we're going to start testing and then some other kind of fun stuff so um yeah that is just the general gist and letm know if you have any questions and I'll just keep making these videos document what we're doing for me me and forever else for anyone else thanks
