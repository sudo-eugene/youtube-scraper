# what's actually working in our "vv system" right now... | E54

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the VVS effect and what is working. Now, we currently are running three funnels. A VSSL opt-in funnel, a DTA funnel, and a low ticket ascension funnel. I'm going to be talking about which one of these is printing cash but not scalable. Which one of these is burning cash, but how altogether they are working now that we have over a month of data. Last year, we did 30 million cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done now over 72 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on this channel is to share what did work, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of cool people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. First off, I am tired. My eyes are bloodshot. I'm on hour 14 staring at this screen. I did go to the gym, so that doesn't count. And we are running on nicotine, caffeine, and I'm a content creator now. So, let's go. All right, first funnel, we have the VSSL opt-in funnel, which is quick overview for everyone. A name, email, opted in to watch a free training. VSSL goes to an application after the CTA comes in the video. So, it is not you can't just apply immediately. You have to wait until the CTA, which is like call it 24 minutes. Some are shorter, some are longer. Land on an application. When they fill that out, they are routed if they're either quality or a DQ. Depending on how full the calendars are, the DQ will either send them to low ticket as a bridge or it will put them on a lower quality calendar, round robin, two different round robins, high quality, low quality. They will land there and then they will get on a sales call with a closer and they will be closed. Okay. The DTA is this, which is this right here. And that is just sending them direct to a page that is headline VSSL application that is right there. So they can literally apply the second they land on page that then runs through the same router. different application, different questions to qualify them more and then routes them to those same three options. If my video is lagging, I bought a new laptop and I literally haven't set it up yet because I have been on this one for too long and I don't have time. So, I'm sorry. And a load ticket. The load ticket is a two-step. So, first one is name and email. Then that is when they begin the checkout process, takes them to a checkout page. So, we get them as a lead as well as we can remarket to them via email. Then they check out on here, move over, and on the Otto is actually instead of getting more money and offering more things through upsells and downells, which we're going to talk about, it pushes them to a booking page where they book in with a setter, talk to the setter over here, and then they get qualified, disqualified, and pushed over to a closer call through set and then to a close. Okay? And then quick little thing, once they're done booking the call, we ask them to fill out an application. There is a direct correlate to the people who fill out more information inside the app on the end. Basically like an onboarding questionnaire that purchase. All right. So what are we doing here now? I have data on this for over a month. It's like 40ome days of these now where they've all been running in tandem, but we've been splitting like crazy. So I'm going to be looking at data over here because I don't want to put it on screen because it would take too long and I don't have that much time today. So I'm going to be looking at data over here and I'm going to be talking over here on these. So VSSL optin we are running two different opt-in splits. We have tried short or yes two different opt-in splits. We have tried short form. We have tried page copy changes. We've tried all this. The control still wins. So technically this is like a split that won a while ago. So it really is the like the control was a split from the one that we did like 70 million through. Um so one is actually winning of that. But now we are just running one of these and we are running one VSSL that won and the VSSL won by the split not winning. That makes sense, right? Our CMO came in and was like literally this you like if you run a split test and it is inconclusive like kill it. Go back to the control. We were not doing that for like eight months. We had two different VSSLs on and we had them all over the funnel in different places for retargeting and for other positions. So going through here, this is still directly our most profitable funnel. Okay, directly. Now VVS effect if you watch the roundt video it's kind of the joke it's the value vortex system which is what my CMO talks about and he talks about running all three of these in one. Now for our DTA you are we are getting dramatically lower cost per call dramat like aggressively lower but if you can understand why sending traffic direct they do not have to consume anything they don't have to opt in they don't have to do anything to apply right so you just have faster quicker throughput I know many people doing high millions uh a month with this model ours has not fully cracked or backed out okay so this is the one that if I was to say what would you turn offer is bleeding cash. It's that now interesting things I found. So I track and over here I'm looking at my data. I track when they come into the different funnels and then I track what happens basically on this backend which is the application, the booking with the closer or more so the call with the closer and then when they actually purchase. I have them sorted by who purchases. So on day I can see cool we had 12 units and then real quick across this way I can go where did they come in and at what times and did they come into multiple of them which is the value vortex system. Did they come into all these? Did they come into which one and in what order? Very interestingly, well, first off, for cold, this one number two was like vastly winning. So, it was winning on how many apps it was getting. It was winning on how many bookings it was getting, and it was also winning on how many backed out. So, I have videos on how we do tracking for this, but VWO has been the best for us because in a call funnel, it's extremely important. You're not having onpage events. So, you need to be able to see who backed out in the CRM and tie that back to what page did they come through in the split. Okay? So, you can do all that in VWO. very simply um vwo.com. It's like visual wooabooga organizer or something. I don't know, but it's vwo. I'm cracked out today. I'm sorry. So, also the comments on these last videos have been gassed. They're so funny to me. So, little things are funny to me at this point in life. Um now, this one, interestingly enough, if I look at the data, is showing over half of the purchasers that have come through this one have come through and already been in the original VSSL funnel. So, what does that mean? That means they're seeing an ad after the fact. They are already warmed up, which is the consumption theory, right? And then they're coming through here with a better application, a better system, better routing, and then getting on the phone with the closer and closing like real quick, like within two days, cuz it's a two-day booking window and like a very, very quick turnaround. So, what that means for us is, okay, maybe this is a function until we crack it on cold, which is like the real goal here. Because if you can practice on cold, meaning your VSSL, your headline, the consumption, the application does enough, you know, qualifying that even when you route people out that aren't qualified, the ones that come through are at a cheaper cost per booking than the ones that you'd get through a VSSL opt-in, like a normal one. Um, because you can get, you know, $50 calls through these, like no problem. Um, and up there you maybe get net net on the proper ones, 200 bucks, 150, 300, somewhere in that range. And that depends on a lot of things. A lot a lot. If you're optimizing for a schedule or a lead, you're going to get them for 50 bucks up there, too. But then they're not going to be the quality people, unless your pixel is like the most beautiful thing in the planet. And then if so, send me your pixel. So now for us, it is working on retargeting. So we have all these other campaigns that we actually don't do like real retargeting in the sense that you point them back to page, right? Like the middle of funnel ones. And we have the ones that we do. The ones that we do, we were sending to an old page with actually the old VSSL on it that used to convert better for us. At least we thought, and we didn't track properly necessarily. So maybe it was wrong. So we are now testing sending this as retargeting because so both in the emails which is a lot of them uh that come through booking wise and then also app then booking wise and then we're also testing it direct in ads. Okay so this maintaining to run the other thing on this is we're running a completely dedicated second one of these that is a different niche specific. So right we always talk about like the different buckets of it or the different messaging buckets. So, we launched another one that we had like in the archives basically that was um different optin or messaging around different opt-in, different VSSL, same app, same booking, same whatever. So, it was really just those first two pieces. We found that it was working on this. We said, "Let's launch it up here. Costs are solid. They're in alignment." So, they're not like crazy low, but they're backing out like crazy. So, okay. So, you have one of these up here that's rorowaz positive. You have one of these that's rorowaz positive. And then you have one of these of these variations that's very row as positive but mainly is acting as retargeting. Okay. Now the mystical one the low ticket. So we have three different variations of these. Number two won actually the original control still won and then we tested three and four and five and we finally have one that is beating the control. The control is ugly. It is gross and uh it's like almost like bad for brand in my eyes. It's so bad and I built it. So let's be very clear here. I was the one who designed it and built it. I threw it up in 2 seconds. I made a very beautiful one that was like an Allen Sultanic one had like a 3% page conversion. Good ones have like 8 to 10 bad. Then we launched a super ugly one just to like run retarget to and it was just like printing. Then we turned it to cold and it stayed at the same freaking rate at like scale or us, you know, mini scale but like testing scale. We made beautiful ones, nothing. Still haven't beat it. So now where we're at with this is we tested a new one that is a different format. Basically has everything above the fold. And that then sends over to the checkout page and the booking. The booking is crushing crushing like getting like 60 to 70% of the people that come through as purchasers. And then we also have a setting team then built into there that is pushing them back to get on a call or actually basically just connect with them live call, not push them to the set call and then push them to a closer. These stats on that, let me pull this accurate accurate for you just because I don't want to lie live. these stats on that. They're definitely Yeah. So, right now it's like 75% show rates of things that come through here once they get to a closer and have basically double the live call close. So, they are warm, they are process, and because they have the economics, which if you go into my other videos, you will see the economics behind this, it crushes. Now, why are we not scaling the out of this? Two things. One, it has a bandwidth issue here. So, as many setters as we get, we dedicate them to it. We try and do that best we can. You hit a weekend and something fluctuates. It's even a little bit lower. Random days, it'll pump out double the amount of units or 40% more of the units. Not double, 40% more units. It'll cook it completely, fill that availability. Now, on those days, you also have the lowest cost or net CPA because we're still sending spending around the same budget, but the economics are breaking. The economics is here, and then it's here, and it's here, and then it's here. So, the blended average is somewhere up here, which still works in a CPA basis. Like, I just said a lot of lingo. Let me back up. I just said a lot of things that are just very technical or or lingoy. The cost per acquisition after you collect the cash for this needs to be, call it 50 bucks, call it whatever. Let's call it 50 bucks. Just simple example for this. Okay. On days that it does a ton of them, same budget, it'll be around 50 bucks. Now, on other days, it'll be call it a 100 bucks. Simple math. In between there, the spread is 75. That is a massive swing when it nets out to what you're trying to get to, which is your ascension rate. Okay, our ascension rate is crushing. Last month is the biggest like question that we're waiting on because it takes X amount of time for those people to become from low ticket purchasers to back in ascension. We are doing everything we can to make it so that time table goes like this. For example, today we have like six of our units are ascensions. Okay. Now I track all this in HubSpot. So I have the purchase dates of all these things. So I can run a report and say everyone who purchased the low ticket last month. Show me a report on them and then how many of them bought the backend purchase since then at all during that same month into the future whatever. So I've ran this for the month prior. I've run this for the quarter before. I've ran all of that and we have been massively in KPI of what we're targeting for ascension rates. Cool. last month into this month, it is toggling a little bit of below KPI, but we're only five days into the month. And my guess based on the stats I'm looking at is over the next 10 days, it'll back out because those people then continue to consume. They see more ads, they get more emails, and then someone who purchased here is now warm enough and has already been nurtured enough to then book a call and apply. Excuse me. So that one is printing for us. But because the net CPA is rising and because or inconsistent, not necessarily rising, and because the call availability, it has like a double throttle issue. Now, I'm stupid. There's easy ways to do this. We can add upsells, we can add downells, we can make this into an AOV focus thing and basically make it front- end profitable. But because for us, the biggest thing here is getting them on the phone because we're trying to optimize for volume on the back end, that's an issue. So what are we doing about that? We are have been talking about it and for us we don't want to launch any of these like low like lowquality bad products. These quick faceless PDF things you see people launch and like just do it to collect cash. Like that's not our brand. That's not what we do. So we have to go through product creation mode in order to create the stuff that can be sold as order bumps and on there. Okay. So that's where we're at because as soon as we can add order bumps and even if we can offset it by $10 to $20, meaning that we're going to add order bumps to these checkout pages to make it so the AOV goes from 50 bucks to 60 or $70 and then that we can be over that range where we can scale into it knowing that those fluctuations still keep us within KPI. If we can do that, we can scale this like crazy. Put as many setters as we need just like on the bench sitting there ready because this is not hard to solve for. This is a little harder to solve for. So, we're doing everything on these page splits to try and just get it just naturally all while these products are being created because again, we're not going to sell [ __ ] People love to sell [ __ ] but we are going to sell good things because we want good products that then lead to better or not better but different uh products on the back end, the onetoone personalization, the onetoone coaching because that is where you're going to get you have the highest likelihood of getting a result. Okay? And that's why people pay me more for it. So, that's the current plan. um this one and we also have like complete different VSSLs being built around different brand faces. We are trying to reduce founder risk. We are trying to navigate and better align with the target demo uh with the brand face portion. So we're going to have multiple brand faces that do this across multiple right now when we ran when we run a brand face they run back to this core funnel which is uh the co-founder brand face. So, it like kind of has there there's some inongruency across that when it's like this person and then it goes to this person. Now, how is this going to work technically? I don't know because I'm probably going to have to have three different funnels built out for like different brand faces and we're going to go through. So, it's going to be brand face ad, brand face on landing page, brand face in VSSL. Big question, what about the emails? The emails come from the core brand face who it's been for 71 million. How do we do that? So, I'm navigating. we're going around. But I got a sales manager who's a rockstar, who's literally the number one person that we wanted and I'm stoked about it. So that's exciting because we solve for that. And then the feedback loops in these start spinning and we start going, "Oh, wait. 40% more of these clothes." Because now closers are hitting KPI and we know which one of these to feed. We can make tweaks to this. Another thing we're talking about for this one is adding a consumption buffer. So basically duping this out, VWO split testing it and just having the only difference that the button does not show until about 3 minutes in, maybe even as long as DT as as long as the CTA. So same thing I said up here, about like 20 something minutes. I don't know if we want to do that because we haven't taken them in. So it's kind of like a delicate balance of you don't want to like hold it off so long that they don't have anything to do on page, but you also don't want to wait. You also don't want like it works here because they've opted in, they've already showed the intent and you can remarket to them. If you lose them off this, the only thing you can do is retarget them back and that's kind of tougher because you might be losing people that would actually have the intent to do it and make it through the application at least. So, you just kind of have to play that game. But right now, it's like forcing zero consumption. They can just apply even though the questions are like, "Did you watch the video? Did you do this and this?" Like, and that's how we used to run it actually a version of it we used to run and then we stopped doing it and we ran this for a long time. It worked and we just scaled into that. So costs on this are crazy good, but it's more so about if it backs out, which is also a sales function. We got a sales manager. I'm stoked about that. That is going to be a huge needle mover for us. We're at likeund something on day and it's not that late right now. So things are looking good. Um, but things can be better and they can always be better. And we're trying to take this thing up to hundreds a day steady. So that's kind of the update. Kind of a mental blah. I am just busy right now. So, I'm going to get back to doing these early early in the morning so I can come up with like full ideas. This is more so just like brain dumps and me being dumb. Um, but I'm trying to make sure that I continue to pro provide value in these and continue to just give you an insight into what we're thinking, where we're at, and how we're trying to do it. And all by saying we don't necessarily know. There are dumb things that we've done. I found an automation that was broken. Oh, here's a fun one. Here's a fun little nugget. So, I saw someone talking about N8N. I felt like an idiot because I'm like kind of the tech and automation guy, but I haven't even touched the tool. So, like I'm not the tech and automation guy. Uh, we have three million something zaps. We pay like this absorbent fee. I think that's how you say that word. Uh, to Zapier. I sent these videos over to senior tech lead and said, "Hey, are there anything that's on our big ones?" Because we run like massive internal database stuff for the coaching side for like of analytics. So, we'll run like a complete database of things that show how many calls happened, sentiment of the calls with AI, uh what was covered in them, um did they cover certain things in them, the time of the calls, the averages across, like just this massive thing that basically shows like an analytics suite bird's eye view. Is the coach doing their job? And uh it's a lot of zaps. It's a lot of functions to get the data in and out, in and out, in and out, all the messages, all the stuff, all the video recordings, all of those consumed, all of them. Like, it's a lot. and it costs too much to pay Zap to do it. So sent over Naden and he plugged it in and we just like literally saved like 50% off our Zap bill like because we replaced all the core ones that were doing like massive amounts of data and N8 is functioning on executions not on tasks. So thought that was interesting quick little nugget simple things you don't even have to go crazy and go AI on it but now he's going to figure out ways to enhance it with the extra functionality. This was just a replacement which I made an X post about. I was like, I need to replace things first, then enhance them. Um, or enhance them in the process of replacing them. So, brain dump again. But all the videos are on here. You know where to find them. Daily update is that we're scaling into it. We got a sales manager, which was our main bottleneck that we were facing or that we thought we're facing right now. Bookings are consistent. We can scale into them, but we can't scale into them without it backing out. So now assuming we can do that we'll be able to scale the front and the back and the middle which is like sales and then the back end is yet to be launched and is about to be launched for the retention big long-term play which is where all of the profits the big profits are made where the enterprise value is built and that's that. So talk to you guys soon. You know where to find me Instagram X all the things. Have a great day and I'll do another one early
