# how I'm building a “Niche Personal Brand” | EP74
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN6C6rRK_9g

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how I'm scaling my niche personal brand. I started making videos 74 days ago, and today is video number 74. So, we're going to talk through how I approach this, what my initial plan and goals were, fast forward to today, and what my learnings and outcome of that plan were, and then how I'm iterating that on the plan to the future. This will be extremely helpful for you if you are looking to build a niche personal brand. Last year, we did over $30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over actually 74 million in total cash collected in that business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what I'm actively doing literally and with all with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities, and network with cool people building cool So, let's get into it. So, this is a little bit meta because you guys are obviously watching this. Uh, and I hate the word ph or the phrase personal brand, but we're here now. It's going to get some clicks. So, when I started this, it was essentially zero. So, I had like a 100red on X. I had an old account and I started to post on it a little bit. I had 800 on Instagram, which is like family, friends, and like some people. And I had 80 on YouTube somehow. I don't even know how, but I did. So, the initial plan and how I came to it was like, oh, I don't want to be like an Iman or Hermosi level person. And that's like saying, and it's so it's such a silly like frame to be in and just wrong. So, that's like saying, I don't want to look like Mr. Olympia, so I'm not going to go to the gym. Like, you're not just overnight going to have millions of followers and be seen by everyone and do all this stuff, nor do you have to be on the content wheel and like do all that stuff as much as they do. And I was just so wrong about that. And I was like, okay, so how do I approach this? So, I paid for a course. I actually paid for Iman's AFL1 which was I don't know 20 grand I think. Um and paid for that and there's a bunch of good stuff in there but really what it was was just a kick in the ass for me to just start posting. So instead of doing high quality videos and getting cameras and setup and lighting that was just seemed like too high of like it just didn't seem approachable for me. So I was like I'm just going to do these raw so I can just shoot looms. I initially started with looms and then moved into this software which is screen studio. So I know my video is like over here. I guess I'm pointing at that but I'm in the corner but you can make it all these other places and it's like super fancy and I don't use any features. I just export. So I was like I'm just going to talk about what I know which is marketing tech and ops. Last year we had just crossed over 30 million. So I was like okay cool. We grew from 12 to 30. I can talk about the things I know about that which in my scope is really like I guess the entire business and more so as I scaled into this but was really about understanding marketing the marketing tech and the operations of the business. So I was like I can just talk about that and I'll post weekly target three to three to 5k of like a honeypot on YouTube and X. And Iman was like yeah you should just do it on those two platforms. do long form on YouTube and conversational on X. I start posting on X and instead of doing weekly I was like I'll just go daily like whatever. I I mean I would rather do that. Woke up early in the morning and was just making these mirror boards. Uh actually wasn't even using mirror in the in the beginning was using Google Docs and I just started posting every single day. Um so the goal was to get three to 5,000 of what my honeypot was. So I defined the niche for me as high six figure seven figure a month entrepreneurs. So people who are online business, info coaching, ecom, lead genen, affiliates at like that world of people that are just hitters in that space and the number is arbitrary, but it's just someone who's at that level or that that thinking. So I can then get talent. So you know, through their networks, have following for talent. Um, everyone knows everyone once you get, you know, one connection away type understanding. Um, and then opportunities wise, I was like, okay, maybe I'll just find companies that can get equity and maybe uh make a couple million bucks a year doing that and then really just network with people. So, I just have access to a cool network that when I'm in a city or I want to talk about something, I don't really have any local friends or friends in general that were in the space. So, I was like, "This is the goal. I'm going to share the the wins and the losses because the big thing with me is like you see everyone share these like really high production things that are all about the wins." And there's some good out there too, for sure, that are like how-to exacts and day in the lives and stuff that are cool to see and like are inspirational, but not a ton about the L's. or if it is, it's just like a big focus on that and then it quick transitions over and it's like now but here's how I won out of that somehow and like made all this money and like buy my thing and for me I was like I'm not going to do that. So, examples of how I guess these are this isn't really initial plan because this is as I did it. But yeah, I mean I was sharing videos when we were losing month uh money month over month and we were doing you know 1.5 whatever. I did month reviews. I did daily updates on cash. I was sharing days we did 30 grand which is like you know we're losing money when it comes to team ops ad spend everything. Um and now in the videos and you know this can change quickly as we all know but uh we're pacing you know record new monthly into this next month. Um and it's the 25th today but you know we're crushing this month. I'll do a month and review that you guys can see at the end of this. But yeah, so that was just the initial plan was just beat the drum, get to 385,000. Interesting part about this before I go into like where we got to today. I was on day 34 or five and I had like 300 on these platforms. I had like maybe a thousand on Instagram. That one started to slowly tick up. And I don't even use Instagram. I don't know how. I sit at my desk all day and I need to get better at that. But like I don't have like day in the life or like lifestyle or stuff that I do other than just work on this. But X was good because I could share stuff, but was very very low. And YouTube was like slow ticking. So I got to like 300 and something um on YouTube after like 34 days. It was basically like 10 a day roughly. Then somebody that I was messaging with because I was still getting a bunch of DMs from pretty high quality people on uh Instagram and uh someone was like, "I'm about to put you on, about to put you on." And they shared me on X. And my ex just exploded. I went to like 2400 on X in like two days. Uh YouTube jumped to like 2500, 2,300, something like that. Um Instagram jumped a little, not a ton. And yeah, I just got beating the drum. So that was on like day 34 and so now it's been another 40 days and the growth curve of it slowed but had like increased the overall floor of all the views on YouTube. Uh the subscriber like amount every single day and it's just like consistently grown. So I started to really really lean into X and now like I 500 is low. I'm just saying 500. Um, I get 10 to 20 DMs a day and there's a there are beginners, no doubt. Um, you know, based on my initial target being this honeypot, but I have over a hundred people that are doing over a million a month in info, ecom, like it's crazy, crazy, crazy. And like it's not just info, ecom, it's info, ecom, agency, lead genen, like just a bunch of people who have crushed it. And that and I'm also including in this cuz I think it's probably like 80 or so of this because I have them flagged in there. Um, but then there's a bunch that have done exits or that are outside of the online space. So, I'm not including those guys in in I'm including those guys in this number, but they're not really, you know, million a month guys. Um, and there's five that I talked to that are doing over three million a month, which is like more than us, equal to us amounts, which is cool. So, there's definitely some people that are doing like way bigger numbers in other industries and stuff, but in in phone coaching, I haven't directly talked to anyone um that is, but it just goes to show like this content and how I'm doing this video right here attracted these people, right? And I try to be like no fluff, no ego. It's not meant to be like douchy or whatever when I'm like oh 74 million in this it's like you know show in proof and then instantly go into like listen we take L's every day and we do all this stuff and like literally yesterday our call confirmation thing broke so it didn't go into Slack so then setters didn't confirm calls and I had like a 34% show rate and we lost however you know 50 grand on that day of opportunity cost so like every single day but side tangent so access to talent I tested that as my first one that was my first you know goal I wanted to get and we posted for a sales manager one of these guys that's just like a whale super cool had never heard of his company and they did 30 million in info last year. His sales manager reached out to his network and knew a guy, connected me with him and we hired him and now he's crushing for us. So, it's like that worked which is great. And then opportunities was an interesting one because I don't know what necessarily I was expecting with that. It was just kind of like sounded like a good idea to get it and I get this flooding in. So like the mix between these numbers is people trying to pay for hourly consulting. Do you have a course? Do you have a mastermind? Can I pay what any of this stuff and I just deny it all. Well, I basically I'm just like, "Hey, send me a Google doc. send me a loom, ask me questions, do any of this stuff and like I'm happy to help and I do I'm getting kind of behind on them actually which is why I created the Q&A request thing and those don't get submitted to there because people don't want to share their numbers publicly which I understand but yeah so I've just denied these so I don't I mean I'm going to go into my new plan here but this one's interesting and the network's huge so now I can post on X and get feedback on things I can have conversations with people that I couldn't before and that's where we get into new plan so my goal right now is to just beat the drum to 100 is like my next 30-day goal basically is I want to get to daily. So, I'm at 74. I'm going to get to at least 100 and I may need to slow the volume and go to X days a week and go to three to five days a week somewhere in there. Maybe I'll love it and I'll be on some new wave and continue to do it. Uh, right now I kind of have the time, but like I've definitely sacrificed some things and I'm not good at skill man. Like my skill in my time management of like trying to run the company, trying to do YouTube, trying to like do all these other things in my personal life is like really bad. So, I need to solve for that somehow and I'm working on that. But like I need to hit the hundred. I need to I need to. So um yeah but from the how do I explain this part? So for the talent portion it's turned into conversations. So the shared so sharing all this stuff has found me. I guess this is probably the wrong word but it's more like network turned into conversations. So the network that I've now built through these socials has given me access to have conversations with a bunch of people that like I've looked up to for a long time or that are crushing in the space that I've never heard of and who have cool insights. So, what I'm starting to do is do conversations. So, I have like a massive list. I made a list of like 80 people and I'm trying to get up to a hundred where I can just do onetoone conversations with them and then post those. So, I'm sure if you guys go to the channel, you will see I have I think six or seven of them so far. I talked to Eddie first. That one crushed. I've talked to Josh Gavin. I've talked to Amed, Brooke, Hadink. I've talked to like all these guys who are cruising. Um, and it's cool because I didn't know any of them prior and they found me through this and then we ended up getting connected. I have, you know, Mark Scales brands. I have um that just I have a bunch of people. You can go on my ex and see the list. But now I can have conversations with these people that I would not have been able to do here. So now instead of me just spewing at the internet and just making videos like this, I'm now able to have conversations about what's working now. What's your business model? How is that structured? Oh, that's interesting. You guys do low ticket here and you do high ticket here. Oh, your back end is like or it's all organic and your back end is, you know, this crazy has this crazy LTV because you do this. Like just cool stuff that I get to learn and then get to share with you guys. and we try not to share like too much private information, but they're fun. So, I need to get better at structuring those conversations. So, in my new plan, because I've heard, you know, some people watch all of them, some people say that I talk too much, some people all that stuff. So, I'm trying to like change and structure how I do these, but not make them too rigid with their like interviews. Like I said, go to x amount of days a week. I'm down to continue to like I'm definitely going daily up until 100. Like, I just have to um which is going to be hard because I have some international flights and stuff, so it's going to be funny, but we're going to make it work. So, do that. And then after that, I think what my goal is, everyone shreds me on accident. Like, you'd think a marketer would understand how to get these to work and get these to get more views. And it's like I don't Yeah, I do. I understand the list of 12 things I need to do. And I don't want to do them. I don't want to spend I'm already like spread pretty thin trying to just do these every day long form um and make these docs and whatever. I know this one's not that intense, but like I have some pretty intense ones I make and I need to get better though at the packaging, pre-prep, etc. And I still want to make them raw, but there are ways to package these, make better um visuals, make better process walkthroughs of stuff we're doing. And also, if I go to more X days a week, I basically talk about like what's hot now or like what we're working on now. And I think I'll be better at like piecing and parting that and being able to look back and be like, "Oh, this part of marketing structure I can talk for 30 minutes on very specific and have a ton of or like processes. This portion of sales management I can talk about in this way. this portion of how we're doing LTV to CAC I could talk about in this way with like really in-depth models not just like whipping them together. So I think this will be more helpful get more views and maybe probably be more impactful because I might go a little slower and more thought through. So I think that'll help and I don't know I don't know what the market size is but like right now I'm almost at 5K right on these. So maybe 10K. I know guys that are in this world that have like I pulled up a thing of who watches or like what other channels do people watch that watch mine and it's like Jeremy Haynes and some of these other guys. um Bizroids, you know, Becker's, uh Iman's business channel, stuff like that. And those guys have like 20, 30, 50K. Um so I think that's I don't really know what the target is, but this direction. And then I do think I want to lean into some of the Instagram stuff, but the only thing there is I don't live the life like that. Like what would I don't know what I would share like my desk and I don't want to do reels and all that stuff. I don't think like I just don't think that that's my vibe. I think I'll get the wrong audience because again, I still have the same goal. I want access to talent. I want opportunities to do cool deals. And I I do want to talk about that a little bit for the opportunities. My goal there has just shifted. I don't want to monetize in the way that all these guys monetize and sell some course or consulting or whatever. Like I'm literally not selling you anything. I just want to have access to it and build it up and then have some way that maybe we all, you know, there's criteria that are in a group chat or in some like in-person event so I can meet everyone in person which is kind of more the networking one. Um, but then yeah, maybe into the future as we scale this like I want to fullon lean into the business we're scaling and we are leaning into that. Um, but maybe into the future there's opportunities to do more of a hormosy style where we do get equity and lean those maybe. I don't know. It's just like not even on the radar. So, nothing is for sale and you can't buy anything and I'm happy to answer questions if you structure them well and don't just send me voice notes. But yeah, I don't know. I I've liked this journey so far. I hate this personal brand word. I can't even believe I'm making these, but like we're here now and we are. So, hope this was help for you guys. All to say, if you're trying to do this, it's really about just picking a niche that is like really specific and then making making sure that your content, the content style, all that stuff tailor to them because I I don't think I could do these raw videos and go to like a zero to 10K audience, which is like the, you know, beginners and all like at the same way that I could do this. Like they like the flashy, it's like they like the quick with it, the edits, the stuff. So, they can like, you know, shorter attention span. And I'm going for people who like my docs and who like the simple stuff and who like, you know, simple is maybe the wrong word, but um just raw. Just raw. So, I hope this has got across and gets to the right people. Um I'm constantly trying to evolve and scale and learn new things. This has identified a ton of things for me that I am not good at. Specifically, like I said earlier, like I have no EA. I have none of that stuff. And it's difficult for me to manage all this. And I'm like dropping the ball all over the place and I'm checking X and then YouTube and like building this chart and then I'm like, "Oh, wait. I got to go do this." And then I come back and I'm like what? I'm oh the chart. And like I get slacks at 8:00 p.m. and 11 and like it's just all over the board and I'm trying to get better at that. So this has introduced a lot of actual struggle to that or this portion more so. Um so yeah. So just trying to constantly evolve and find new cool people. But that's that. Um daily update. All these videos are on the www.rroncl um on here. I actually have to update the last few videos on there but I sort them by tech sales marketing ops uh mindset. And you can go through here so you can see the main idea of what these ones are about. There's a ton of golden nuggets in these. Um I put them on a playlist so you can watch them in order, but there's no order. So I would start here uh if you want where you can actually just sort them by this or filter by the category that you're stuck on or what your bottleneck is. And yeah, that's what this is all about is just constantly progressing. That's my goal in life right now is just progression. So personal, physical, uh financial, business, all the things. Just trying to progress and just go towards it. So yeah. And then the overall daily update is we're cruising. I'm going to do a monthly update at the end, but we're trending towards three, which is crazy because we were like 1.59, I think, last month or 1.5, somewhere in that range. Um, so hopefully we're going to have a massive June. Um, but right now, just trying to figure out or finish out May. So, appreciate you guys. Any questions as always, um, X or Instagram DMs are pretty good. So, I'll talk to you guys soon.
