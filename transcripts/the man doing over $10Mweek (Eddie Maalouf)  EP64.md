# the man doing over $10M/week (Eddie Maalouf) | EP64
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk7rLM-XOYQ

I can't I can't do a countdown. All right, guys. We're doing something different today. We got Eddie Malof here. Bad marketing. He was with us in Dallas, but he had left, so he was unable to be on our funny round table talk. So, I figured we'd get him on here and I'm going to try and do these like every week where we just have someone killer that you probably haven't heard of. Eddie, you probably have heard of, but what up Eddie? What up, dude? I'm excited, man. I can't believe I missed the round table, too. I'm the one who invited you to that event. You are. In fact, you're the one who invited and did every dinner and every everything and uh yeah, we just got to benefit from you. So, I appreciate that. Uh, all right. I fed your name into Chat GBT in deep research and I said, "Find every podcast, find every video, find every everything, and give me all the stuff that I would talk about with him based on what we talked about." So, we're going to start it off fresh. Did it do a good job? It did a fantastic job. Really? Wow. I I actually learned things cuz I know you like, you know, pretty well, but not super. And like I I've consumed a lot of your short form, but I haven't consumed some of the long form, but not like your story and your journey stuff, but I know some of that from us talking. Yeah. But literally kick it off direct entire video and everyone who watches this or who the target is of these is low seven to eight figure people. So I get comments not DMs non-stop that are people that are sending these to their team or they are doing like I have three or four pe three three that I talk to that do over 30 million a year in info that I didn't even know existed. I didn't know they're companies that do over 30 million in info. Those are the best though. Lot right. I mean, that's kind of what we were and then I doxed ourselves. But, uh, so yeah, a lot of no fluff, not a lot of beginners. There are some, but I try and like tailor those differently. So, all I want to do is real stories, wild scale, deep strategy, and then we're not going to dox anyone. We already do that at dinners and stuff where we talk and we're like, hey, we're not going to say names, but like no client names, none of that [ __ ] Just cuz neither of us want to do that and be those guys. So, insane stories, wild winds, brutal L's, all the scale. So, to start it, give me your give me your twominuter for people. So, I got things right here from basement to 300 staff, doing college dorm sales, betting on yourself. What's your What's your elevator? A little longer than elevator. Um, a little longer than elevator. I um started doing sales, which is why I think I'm good at marketing. I started doing sales. Um, got to a point where I was just closing everyone and I needed more leads. I got into marketing to get more leads. Then I realized I need to sell to more than one person um at a time, which was my biggest bottleneck. you can only close one to one. Um, and so I basically quit my sales job, went full-time into marketing, did it for my parents' businesses, and then, um, basically found out, you know, logically like I can't work with massive corporations here. I'm just a solo dude in the basement. Uh, but in the Middle East, I could go and get a massive client like, you know, uh, Burger King, Intex, which is like one of the biggest plastic manufacturers in the world. Um, VTEC, which is like the biggest toy manufacturer in the world. Like I got all these brands. I helped them build their ecom systems. Um, I worked with them in the Middle East, crushed it, got into the supplement space, crushed it. Um, and then started kind of just doing it in America, too. And even though I had all these results in the Middle East, it was pretty crazy. I was like a peasant here. Like, so all of those were that. So like parent stuff and all those and the supplement, those were all non US. You start Yeah, that's uh uh everything except the supplement was non US. Yeah. Uh, but I mean I'm talking insane scale like you know spending I mean at the time it was insane scale to me but I would spend like six figures a month and make a 40x ROI on it because no one else was doing it, right? So there wasn't even ecom in the Middle East. Um, so that was really cool. Then I came here did a bunch of supplement stuff. Um, also crushed it. Did some black hat stuff. I was selling Forex courses, dude. Back in 201 18 I was spending like a 100red to 300 grand a day on meta ads. uh honestly way easier than it was now. But we were running I mean dude we were running every single country in the world. We had our you know 73 country list that was banned like it was just so deep into the data and breakdown. I I don't do it that deeply myself anymore. I got a team obviously. Um but that's been that you know fast forward now we basically 2020 decided let's just start hiring people and actually building a company instead of Eddie doing all this. Yeah. Um and then now we don't have 300 employees. We have 192 as of today. Um, I think with AI it'll probably be less moving forward or the company Dallas. Yeah. Yeah. The company will either grow and we'll stay the same size. Um, or we'll maintain the same revenue and increase profit by decreasing staff. Yeah. Um, so we'll see where that goes. But yeah, now I'm um now I'm more of a CEO than I am a marketer to be honest. I'm in all of our accounts on the info side for sure. I'm in all our biggest accounts on the ecom side. Uh, but am I running ads myself? Am I clicking in GHL and Clickfunnels myself? No. But, you know, I can Yeah. I mean, like yesterday, for example, I looked at an account. I said, "Change this headline to this and do this on the opt-in page." And our opt-in went from 18% to 38% overnight. So, like that's that's my doesn't suck, right? But like I miss running ads. Like I run ads for my other companies like my chicken restaurants. I was going to say that's that was what I was going to ask is what how many do you publicly say that you are owner or partner in how many companies? I mean publicly I don't really talk about too many of them. I just talk about the ones that are like tangible but talking about chicken. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but but like I'm a partner in probably 12 businesses and you know, if I was to calculate the equity value of those, you know, the equity that I own in those businesses, it's probably not including bad, it's probably like $30 million of equity that I own. Yeah. Like investments I made like a million dollars that's now worth five and this one's 100 worth two. You know what I mean? Stuff like that. Yeah. That's one of the more interesting thing like I don't I mean, you're public as bad and obviously you're now doing more short form and stuff talking about that and like just how you think is there. But then when we'll talk at these dinners or something, you'll say something to me and I'm like, wait, part of what software or part of what like franchise or like, you know, digital asset, you know, as you know what I'm talking about. But like digital assets that are what, eight figures? Like crazy stuff that's that I just Yeah. I mean, I'm not privy to that, nor do I do that. I have like that limiting belief that's like the focus. And actually, it's not limiting because it's real because I have I have had an issue, but like I don't know. You've done a good job. Like I have opportunities flooding to me since I started doing this that I'm like, "Oh, I could like own 10% of that or 20 of this and like just do coaching or if I had a lean team of like the simple marketing structure style lean team or I could own a portion and like deploy and like there's layers there." But you've done clearly a good job of like doing that and actually executing on that which I think Yeah, it could be a lot better for sure. But like I I ideally invest in companies that um don't require me to do the job. They have a team internally that can do the job and then I'm basically coaching on the changes that need to be made. And that's I talked to uh so I think it was I'm trying to think of it how this played out. So I followed like Eman stuff for a really like really long time. Like I I've talked about it on here and I don't know how small he was but like OG agency days and never bought any of his stuff. Just stayed privy like the lifestyle and the growth and like he crushes it. And I ended up buying his AFL offer when it came out because I buy everyone's everything. I buy everyone's [ __ ] I'm the guru. I buy all the guru's [ __ ] I learned from and I don't guru. I don't this I mean I guess this is guruing but a different way. And uh he had talked about I had seen you going to his like educate whatever event one of those that he had out there. Yeah. That you guys went to. And it's just like when I started getting talking to him and the structure and how he does things, he I I don't we're not doxing. Email doesn't count as a dox. Uh but he was talking about somebody who does like a group coaching model with equity that makes over eight figures a year eight figures uh just doing group coaching with equity ownership. So instead of someone paying 10K or 50K for some mastermind or whatever to get coaching it the offer structure the monetization model is they get a percentage of the equities. Think like how horosing it but like just group coaching model and I'm sure there's some deploying whatever and I get the details but like crazy. So like you can do it. There is a model to do it where instead of having 40 companies and 40 onetoone calls, it's like you have four calls a month, you have 40 different founders that pop on. It's like, dude, the scale you can do it at like and we kind of talked about that in Dallas is like what could we do where we could get some cool people in the room and not even for monetization, but just to like get the right people. But yeah, it's uh there's a lot of options. There's a lot of options. So, all right, jumping. There always is. But stay focused, bro. Don't get distracted. We're we're going to be at a hundred soon. And then even what we talked about there, but I have some fun updates that I don't really talk about super public, but I think we're going to be able to take this to tens a month just with the current model on the current ham and not the back end. The back end stuff that we're talking about there is pretty big deal, too. Yeah. Yeah. So, all right. Wild stories, fails, flexes. These are always fun. I pulled this on GPT. You showed up in a tank. What does that mean? You showed up in a tank. No, it wasn't a tank. It was a sh They're called Sherpas. So they're like amphibious vehicles. They're actually used in like Ukraine a lot. It's like a really slow low gear vehicle that basically can like swim in water uh and also like climb on land and drive on a road. Uh pretty cool. How do you get your hands on one of those? What What's the uh Bro, you know Steve Harward, right? Yeah. Yeah. I can use his name. It's not a dock. Steve I mean it's Steve it's Steve's car. It's [ __ ] sick. So I went to Yeah. He I mean it's not his main car, but like he has it parked in his backyard and he just runs it every time he wants. So I I basically stayed with Steve for a few days in Utah. We did some business together and um he he he just is full of surprises, bro. This guy's the king of experiences. He took us out on it and I was like I was like, "Fuck it." And then I went to a podcast. I came out and he had like bad marketing stickered all over it and he's like, "Figured you want to shoot some ads in this thing." So Oh, that's [ __ ] dope. Yeah. He pretty much gave me the opportunity to do it and I was like, "Screw it. I'm just going to shoot some ads." Obviously came out. That is like the thing about you that is uncontested and I put this in that expose but like the connector you know everybody whether you're doing but like we've never done work together you and I have never. Yeah. And like the connections and then but like who has connected with who? Are you connecting with someone? We're talking like financing payment plans. I'm connecting with this person over here. I'm like oh who needs the agency? Like you know everybody every conference we go to every dinner every after party your own parties. Like how is that is that I mean that's just you as a person. That's not even like the business side. No, it's definitely me as a person. It's not bad. It's It's more Eddie on that side. Um, dude, I just um I always give without anything in return, which is I think a big key. And when you do that for 5 years, bro, it adds up. You know what I mean? Um, like in the agency world, at the end of the day is a service that I'm providing for people. There's so many variables. There's my team, there's their team, there's their offer, there's like a million things. Like things are going to go wrong and not everyone's going to work with us forever. And even this month, bro, I had three people leave us because they're exiting and the company's buying them for 50 million plus each of them are forcing them to have a team in house. You know what I mean? Like it's like I can't do anything about that. I'm like, dude, we did such a good job that they're now selling their you know what I mean? Phone closing or No, this was an ecom. All all these exits are in ecom. I I don't see a lot of massive I I don't see a lot of exits in the info space to be honest. Um but but yeah, point is like you know the agency side like there's going to be people that work with us that it doesn't work out for whatever reason, but I've always done good business. I've always refunded when asked to. I've like as long as it makes sense obviously. Um I've always done good business and kept good relationships and even people that don't work with us anymore still refer people to us. And so um I think just doing good in the world and you know when people need advice I give them advice all the time and help them and over time that adds to creating those connections, right? And it's reciprocated value, right? Like I've done a lot with you. I've never worked specifically together, but I'm sure if I went and asked you for a favor at this point, you'd be like, "Yeah, bro. I'm down." Like we 100%. And that's Yeah. I think what it's just I don't even know how you get the bandwidth of it. Like I'm so intro that like I love being on the invite list and I would never want to be the one who's like, you know, fully sourcing like cuz I'm like, "Oh, cool." Like I want to go to the dinners and you put the right people in the right room and do the right things in that way. And like almost those are some heavy-hitting rooms. Those are some heavy hitting rooms. Exactly. And it's like to like maintain and like foster the relationships to so like the in you know look at it I say on the channel all the time I'm like everything's a funnel but it's like the inflow of like meeting all the people the nurturing of keeping all the people the you know potential either connects or work with you or work with anyone like that takes a lot like a lot that I just am not good at. Excuse the dog over here yawning. Um but yeah that's that's that's crazy. So um all right I'm gonna jump. We're gonna go boldest and then we're gonna go dumbest thing that you've done within agency. What is the craziest [ __ ] you've ever done? I mean, boldest was naming my [ __ ] company Bad Marketing. That's got to be, you know what I mean? That's got to [ __ ] be up there, bro. Yeah. No, it's a it's a frame shift. There's no doubt. Look, I I really believe in brand. And so here here's here's kind of the logic behind it. Dude, I was getting so many referrals to our business from other clients and other people who worked with us in the past or just people that I'm connected to, let's say like you for example. And um bro, our our company name was Four Media and [ __ ] no one like the number four number four media. So the logic when I first started this company in 2017 as an LLC was like, "Oh, I'm going to have these three people be my business partners. We all have the last name M. How can I use 4M into something for media? [ __ ] it." And whatever. It's a zero revenue company, so who [ __ ] cares, right? Exactly. Um, so anyways, we split up four media and then um basically we um every time someone [ __ ] refers people to us, like we just like they'd be like, "Oh, beat Eddie from M4 4M Media 4." Like no one actually said it correctly. I'm like, "It's so [ __ ] I need something so dumb and simple that no one can ever forget the name of the company because I'm getting all these referrals and my own referrals aren't even writing the name correctly, right?" So, it was kind of like a frustrating situation. And then what happened was basically a company named for media group sent us a lawsuit because they had the rights to the name because they used it one month before us in 2017 because people were applying to their website to work for them and to work with them and they meant to apply on ours. And so I'm like if I was you guys I would have just been quiet and taken as much business and talent as possible. Exactly. It's like flipped. But yeah, they didn't think that way. They don't even exist online. Like all their stuff online is coming from us. And so I was like [ __ ] it. Let's take an opportunity. Bro, we thought of like 10,000 names. And then sarcastically my CFO was like, "Um, yeah, bro. Why don't we just name it bad marketing?" Haha. And everyone's like, "Oh, that would be so dumb and stupid." And I was like, "Nah, we're going to do that." And, um, I saw a guy that had like bad dot marketing. I'm like, "We're going to get in a lawsuit with this guy, but this name is worth a lawsuit." Um, so we basically we basically spun it up. We ran it. It was massive. Everyone knows the name now. It's way easier to remember. Like no one people used to know like Eddie Maloof. Yeah. Now they know like bad marketing. It's agreed. You know what I mean? It's Yeah. Very bold move. Could have been the worst move. This could be in the other category. I saw when you guys did the dude I have a funny story about April Fools. But when you guys did the April Fools like we're changing to good marketing or like better whatever. And that was so funny. And I honestly I was like really like that's an interesting until it took me a while. I have a funny story about that. April Fools our copywriter has been with us from like OG days. Like he writes we joke that he's like the brand face 2.0. know like he can write he like he's her he writes two emails a day every day to the main list he does all the automations he does all the scripting everything and on April Fools two years ago three years ago so we were probably doing 10ish million but we were selling info products so we had more volume of customers active customers and lead flow he sent an email out April fools that was like hey from the brand face that was like hey like this has been like so amazing to build with you all but like I'm just getting burnt out like and we're like hard energy strong like never stop whatever it I'm getting burnt out. Like I'm kind of like over this. Like we'll keep everyone in who's in and like we'll service out your contracts basically, but then we're like done. I'm going to close up shop and just like retire. Sends us out in an email and then does like line break, line break, line break, line break, line break. And then like April fools, like we're back. We're better than ever. Like we're leaning in. We're doing all this stuff. Nobody broke got past the line break. Nobody read that. Nobody scrolled. Dude, we had like it was like 1,200 customer support tickets. We have like Oh my god. We had hundreds in our Facebook community. We had like 12 actual refunds. Like we lost like tens of thousands of dollars like because they were like 12 refunds isn't bad. I thought comparison. Yeah. But like we had to have we had to go live in the community and be like can you all take a joke and like make this big joke about it about like but yeah. No, April Fools. That's that's a good one. But what is the biggest L? And then I want to go into and I feel like I maybe should have done this earlier, but we don't do podcasts around here. We're just having fun. Um but then we'll talk like literally what's working now. We'll talk just straight jam, crazy launches, who's doing not who, but like some crazy numbers you're seeing. But what's the biggest L? Um, I'd say biggest L. I mean, dude, I've had a lot of L's, but I'd say one of my biggest L's was, um, it it was like one of my biggest W's and L's back toback. So, uh, in 2020, um, here's the thing, bro. It's so funny. I I invest in like stock plays, and I hit so big on so many of them, and everyone's always like, "Oh, you should post like why your logic is behind this." So my logic is literally like my intuition of like where the industry is going. Like that's the I see post about meme coins here and there. I'm in the meme I'm in the trenches. I get it, bro. Like I see B like I don't know why everyone's in this meeting right now. I'm just you're sitting there just it's it's not even meme coins. I'm talking actual stock. You know, companies worth a lot of money and I hit big like four or five times a year I'll hit really big on on some stocks. And so in 2020, um, obviously everything crashed, COVID, whatever. And I was like, bro, there's going to be such an overupp of oil right now because no one's driving, like machines aren't working like they normally are, blah blah blah blah blah. So I basically took like 150k, took like 500 grand of margin, 400 grand of marginish, um, from Robin Hood and invested at the literally floor of oil stocks and turned my 150k cash into like 2.4 million in a year. Um, that was probably like my biggest one of my biggest dubs. And then I was like, you know what? I was gonna say, where does where's the bike? Here's the loss. Here's the loss. I was like, you know what? You're becoming too distracted, Eddie, with stocks. So, delete the app from your phone. Don't look at it and just focus on business and getting the company up. And that's where you need to be. And this should be passive. I'm like, got it. So, I did it. A stock that I invested in at like, I don't know, 20 bucks went up to 65 bucks. And then in the time that I had deleted my app went all the way down to $3 and I lost $1.7 million without having I'm like because I'm not going to check the app and get distracted. And so that was pretty brutal cuz like here's what happens. You open you open the app and you're down what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The emotional waves of seeing it. Yeah. It's not even that. You open I open the app and I was like down 500k. I'm like [ __ ] I should have been checking the app. What an idiot. Whatever. I was like whatever. I'm down. I'm not going to sell now. And then like I'm like delete the app. rechecking in two months. I'm down another 500. It just kept going and going. I was like, [ __ ] hell. So, I took an L, but then eventually I was like, I gotta make this back. So, the stock hit like $3 and I just sunk a [ __ ] ton of money into it and then it hit six and I sold it all and I was like, I recovered some of my losses, bro. Dude, take it. But not that's not Yeah, that's a big mistake. I've like played I've never played anything in in stocks really. Like kind of, but nothing of size. Memes, dude. I got we were in a lull period. We were waiting on some stuff. Honestly, like I don't know. I don't really talk about it too much, but like when we were in this like down period. Uh we were just it was kind of like a we were waiting for it to come back mode and like oh they're going to handle it versus like how we then got starting closer to January where we're like we're in we're in. I was on my way out of PR. I was like I got 0% cap gains baby. Like let's lock this thing in like day trade season. And it said it was you know 0% on cap losses. But uh I literally I started just I was serious. It was no joke probably 20 hours a day. 20 hours a day I was just in Photon and Telegram and doing all this stuff. I got I literally closed out I like basically moved around a couple hundred grand just back and forth like total it's like millions of dollars if you look at all transactions but like the total pie was whatever. I get back here I'm in normal US land normal taxes four. It was like a 40hour window. I'm like, bump 200 bucks into like 60k, bump 300 and something into like 40k. Like I clear over 100 G's in like straight profit, buy a car, like cool, all good. Move the cash out of there and then proceed to This lovely domination. That's annoying. And uh then proceed to sit and churn cash in a bucket for like 30 days and then lose it all like two soul at a time. Two soul at a time. And I'm like literally it's just like I'm sitting there when Trump drops and it's at 900 million and I'm like, "Oh, I'm not touching that [ __ ] It looks fake as I watch it go just keeps ripping 10 billion 20 billion or whatever like whatever the [ __ ] number was. It was so big. The problem is there were so many Trump coins in that second that it was kind of but like we knew the legit one. All the chats are talking about it. I got guys I know that are like oh moving money out of business accounts to get into there so they can buy it. Swapping ETH to do it and it's just like yeah it was crazy but guys made like hundreds and millions that I'm literally sitting in chats with and I'm like no I'm not going to buy it. I had like probably 200 grand sitting on the sideline that I could with two clicks I bought at subs. Stuff like that just reminds me how poor I am, bro. When these people are just flipping 30, 40 mil in like a week. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. So, all right, let's get into what's working now. Biggest stuff for us and for everyone here. And just we talked about this a little bit, but right now on the marketing front, we're running three core funnel styles. So, we're doing the main VSSL. That's how we did 70 million straight was literally one funnel, which is like dumb and funny, but very little splits. But your VSSL is interesting because you are actually the first people who um you you're actually the first people who showed me a vertical VSSL. I remember Luke showed me that two years ago and then I converted some of our funnels to a a vertical VSSL to split test and I actually increased conversion on mobile. Yeah. No, we uh we Yeah, we have 90 That's a funny thing. We have like 95 low or low 90s to 95% mobile. And the funny thing for us is we actually have a higher than normal tablet because our demo. So a lot of them will watch on tablet. So we have to like optimize for both because like generally it's desktop but like not because like our demo is the older lady who's sitting there scrolling on her iPad or whatever on the couch and then clicks through an ops. So yeah, the mobile one is crushed for us though. And we actually stole that from somebody that we saw. We had some janky software we had to use and then now we just do Vidalytics and it's like the cleanest. But yeah, so that's the VSSL opt for that which has the mobile. Now we're testing DTA thing with DT which is like for us we just call it it's direct to app direct to VSSL headline DSL and then button is right there. Interesting to hear because you guys run I mean that's what most info guys run. Headline DSL but no apps. We here here's the thing. I know now we're in the low ticket world which is something I'm trying to get really good at to be honest. Uh even for bad and that's our third funnel type that we're running right now is low ticket. Yeah. Which is the one I'm most intrigued about. Right. We were talking a lot about that at the event. It's the one that we're the least expert in, let's call it, as a whole, right? Like I don't have insane amounts of low ticket funnels that are doing seven figures a month to be honest. You know what I mean? Um that's not but you don't have an insane amount that are doing low ticket as themselves as seven figure or just not at all in like ascension because it's really I mean like we we we base it like two. It's like one you have like direct direct to cart baso which is like optimizing for AOV and breaking out and like the six upsells and all that and then you have ascension base which is like what we're running which is like you're just trying to liquidate 50 to 100 I mean ideally as much as possible but at least 50% on low ticket forcing into the high ticket and it's all about high ticket. Yeah, exactly. So that's kind of my point is everything we do is all about high ticket for the most part. I'm just trying to get the most high ticket closes possible and are we all? Are we all? Yeah, I mean not really. Some people their entire [ __ ] business I have people I talk to regularly who are doing six figures a day pure low ticket making money no high ticket back end. I'm like sounds like a dream sometimes. I'm like you're hammered. Like how are you even doing this? Like it's crazy. But um so basically yeah we don't really have too much low ticket. I've hired people recently as strategists in my team that have like come from low ticket backgrounds to help develop that side of the business and start creating more low ticket funnels as a whole. But pretty much mostly everything that we do is either lead magnet or low ticket into VSSL into high ticket sales call or webinar or challenges. Those are probably like the three highest frameworks that we use and we just gotten really good at them. Challenges are pretty damn close to a low ticket funnel in a way, right? Like I'm running ads right now, for example, for a challenge. Our challenge is $49. Our upsell is a $97 VIP and then we have another upsell for like uh basically a program of some sort. Um we're spending a decent amount a day, like five figures a day. Um and we're losing and those are live challenges, right? So that's I mean yeah, but now I'm moving to pre-recorded. So I'm like, dude, if I can just if I can I can hear you. I'm letting this dog out. I can hear you. Yeah. Cool. Cool. If I if if basically the logic is like if I can take this this technically low ticket funnel on the challenge with the upsells and turn it into a pre-recorded challenge where the dude doesn't have to show up and just evergreen it then I can be printing money every single day at a lower return. Sure. But I can be printing money and having daily sales as opposed to just like bulking them into like where we'll do like a million dollars in a day and then like everything built up to that is depending on that one day or that one person going live. And so now we're taking those winning challenges that we have. We're running the same funnels with a little bit more on the upsell side to liquidate more and then basically pushing them through to the challenge. We know our conversion rates. We know our our revenue per uh lead, let's call it on the front end, right? So I know every lead, for example, is going to make me 250 bucks. I'm willing to spend up to whatever 180 bucks to get that lead technically in the door. Um and that's minus the liquidation part, right? So, I might spend $200 to get a lead. $70 goes to liquidation. I'm actually only spending 130. I know that lead's going to make me 250 on average. And that's the game I'm trying to play right now. And so, with a lot of these offers that are pretty secure and have good challenges that we've ran, I'm just automating those into essentially a low ticket funnel that leads directly into a challenge that then sells them a mid ticket or directly to a sales call, a high ticket. I prefer mid ticket. So, they'll buy something for like two grand to five grand on the challenge and then that goes into a sales call ascension. They ascend them and we're ascending depending on the offer. The lowest one is 40%, the highest one 78%. Really? Yeah. People buying 2K upgrading to like a 10K. Interesting. Pretty good spread. Yeah, I know. Very good. I mean, ours is sub 100 for low ticket and then straight to, you know, 7 8 whatever K and that's it. There's no middle ground. There's no direct cart. There's no Yeah, but you don't need one. You're running low ticket to sales call. Yeah, correct. We're running low ticket to a setter setter call to a closer call. too close. Exactly. That's why it's not worth selling it. So, you're not going to do that with a closer. I'm trying to automate all the way to the purchase of the two to 5K and then let them take the the sales call that is someone that's already paid 2 to 5K. Yeah. The I got on with a event. I don't know if you have used them yet. Uh yeah, I hadn't heard of them and because we don't do anything like that. We don't we do no webinars at what's we've never done one. We don't do any direct to cart through that and we don't do anything even internal around that. So I went with them and that's badass. Like a lot of people are like Yeah. They're deeply integrated into a ton of different softwares. Yeah. And I think that that could be a play or the CMO uh which you met, he is big on challenges. He comes from an environment that they do a lot of challenges. But like he even says he's like, you know, it's six team members that are going 24 hours a day during like for the live version to get it live, make sure everything's there, all the like every cadence of that. And like I am not that person who wants that. I have no interest in having like these because you almost have to build a machine as you know like a machine around doing the launches for the different like challenges and events and everything could break every time and everything can break at any time. It's like we got on here. I don't have a mic right now cuz I didn't get the mic. Like that's one simple example of this little like shoot. Oh, that goes in a live challenge. You you're freaking out. The whole thing goes sideways. Exactly. Like I just don't need that. Like again we we lean too far into one funnel with the 70 mil like we are and we say we did. But like the beauty of that is we didn't have to touch a lot of things. We'd have to think like we could think about other parts of the business and we didn't and that's our fault slash my fault. But now that we learned from it, we can. But yeah, for us and I don't do you run any DTA. Yeah. So just like headline VSSL application right there. They apply through book a call. Okay. So like is that is that what DTA is? Direct. Yeah. That's what we call it. So like I've never heard someone call it DTA to be honest. Yeah. Perfect. I branded it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean most our most our stuff is DTA. Yeah. We cannot we have not gotten ours work. I mean the last six months it's been [ __ ] hard as [ __ ] for VSSLs. DTA started like a month ago. Oh yeah. Well, you're in like the worst time ever to try that because like DCA VSSLs are struggling on a CPA and ROAZ basis compared to what they were a year ago. Even two years. Yeah. We're getting like so just we optimize on purchase instead of schedule because we have never been able to get our p or our schedule cooked clean enough that it can predictably get people who show and close. So like the rorowaz on them like it can fill calendars obviously and like at a great cost but we can't get them to back out as well. Then we optimize for purchase. You need to just use that software. I'm not going to give the name here. The software that I connected you with that reads their credit and everything like you can I talk with him. You need you need to use that, bro, because then you can optimize for that because think about like think about how many leads lead to a we just we four months ago I completely agree with you. We just four months ago added uh three months ago now added a financial qualifier but it's in health and ours is like the retroactive one. So we saw that people do this and it does work for us. So we ask in there how much have you invested in your health and fitness like ever basically not what's your income, what's your future, what's your this. It's like how much have you invested and it's less than 1K 1 to5 5 to 10 10 to 20 and 20 plus the less than 1K close at blended like sub 5% sales per booking those that go to book the other one the next is 10% the next is 11 12 and like 11% on those other buckets so like we no longer pixel any of these people so it's training only on these but okay what you're saying yeah we had those guys run it through their software and they or their like their API back and forth and and lined them. And it's like this many of the less than 1K had access to 50K on their current credit cards. This bucket of these people didn't have any like it's it's very different data. Yeah. Which is what I was going to say like actually I I as an opportunist would look at it and be like, "Oh, they haven't spent any money on their health. That means the problem's actually bigger." Right. And no, I'm serious. And so there's got to be a way to convert actually a much higher percentage of these people. And that actually does make sense. And don't get me wrong, the ones who spent money on their health, duh, they're going to be an easier transaction because they've already transacted before on their health. But how I look at it is like that's a bigger problem for these other guys because they've never done it. They must be fatter. They must be more out of shape. They they must have more problems health-wise and this has to be a bigger pain point and I just have to like be able to like squeeze that painoint hard enough for it to come out. And that's why they just haven't spent money because I mean they're they're probably not in shape. No, I I mean I agree. And like I said, when I passed it through the tool, like it clear as day showed that like there are people in that bucket that have the funds and like and are exactly what you said. There are people who got to the point of wanting to book a call. They like, you know, went through the whole mental. So back to your pixel, imagine instead of like limiting the pixel to only measure purchases on a high ticket product, which are definitely like a smaller quantity, then imagine it just filtering for people that came in as a lead that have at least $50,000 as an example. And that's what I'm optimizing as an event. Now I get more than 50 of those events a week every single week on the pixel. And then that's what it's optimizing for. And the biggest issue with purchase is the time because we can do the volume. So like when we're cooking we I mean and you though it's 50 per adset. No, we can't do that. That's what I'm saying. That's the actual volume. The actual volume is 50 per week per adset. Not per account, per adset. You know what I mean? So like you might have 10 here, six here. You might have 200 across the account, but per adset. Well, that's why, and again, we talked to these guys who like somebody popped on with their thing and was like, "Oh my god, your cost per call is whatever. Let's let I'm going to say I'm going to say 400 bucks. Maybe it's half. Maybe it's three times. You guys will never know." Um, but it is it is what it is. And then it better not be three times, bro. And then you have GTA You have GTA ones that, you know, 40 bucks, 90 bucks, 180 bucks, like in that range of like way lower. Way lower. But yeah, I get I have some that are 60 70 bucks. Yeah. And like at relative scale like for Yeah. So, but but why are they so cheap? But why are they so cheap? Exactly. Is because But we now we are starting to get there where they are backing out better than way better than they were. Like literally they wouldn't even show a lot of them. We more or less fix that by doing this new qualifier thing and like seasoning it better. But I like your idea around it. The other side of it which is just like non-technical, non-data, non-marketing is like it's a colder lead. It is somebody who has had less friction, has had less consumption than somebody who opted in, had all the micro across, forced to watch a VSSL before they could apply like all like got all the emails to book, consumed free products you give them if you say the end of the bon like all these things. You don't make them watch a VSSL. The DGA right now is not right now it has the button right readily available. So the next split test I don't run any of those funnels if that's what you're asking me. I misled you. I don't run anything like that. You always do a sticky timer. I have to. I don't even I don't even show them the timer. I just don't show them the button for x amount of time. Yeah. So you just wait until the CTA in the video. Not even Yeah. Not even the CTA. At least like for example, if it's a 12minute VSSL and the CTA is at 8, I still show them the button at 56. But it's like whatever. Okay. So that's that was the split test that I wanted to launch last week was we had three of them. There were three different entire VSSLs. So, same headline, three different VSSL because we have 90 VSSLs we could test right now that we haven't run direct like this. And then the apply under it, but one of them is a clear winner. That is like, let's just say a different messaging niche pocket for us. That one won like by far. Then the next split is I want to dupe that and I want to just make the button come up in 5 minutes. And then I was talking to Kish and he's like, oh no, like let's make it when the CTA is. But that VSSL is like 31 minutes or 26 minutes. Yeah. If you do that, you'll have a massive cost per book call. Massive cost per booking. Yeah. Yeah. And because they bounce and you can't come back, which is like If anything, I would split that 30-minute VSSL, cut it down to a 12 to 15 minute VSSL and split those against each other and you'll see the actual VSSLs. Yeah. Yeah. Like you don't, bro, what do you need 30 minutes for? Dude, we're just we're just amping up the consumption. Just I don't disagree. If they want to consume educational, but you're using Yeah, you're using Vidalytics, though. So, like you can probably see the I can see I can see exactly where they dropped. I'm sure more than half the people don't make it past like 6 minutes. Not even close. That's what I'm saying. On GTA. On the GTA. Not even close. On the Oh, on a DTA. No, of course on a DTA. No chance. Yeah. But no, on the main one, it's it's pretty solid. The main one's good. Yeah. I mean, I if I was you, um I would figure out where the biggest drop off is on the main one time wise and try to make the VSSL similar to that time. Yeah. You know what I mean? Cuz now if if by if if by 7 minutes 50% is dropped off, then I can make a VSSL that's 7 minutes long, as an example, then I might be able to save 25. Yeah. What do you see as the sweet spot? You said up to 15. Like you said 10 to 12 or Yeah. Like I I I try to make my VSSLs around like 12 to 15 minutes. Yeah. Like a really short one direct will be like six to eight. Yeah. I'm a little cracked down. I'm over here and over here, but I didn't finish my thought of the other big piece of this is because that person has less consumption because of that. It requires a kind of more aggressive or just better overall sales rep. Oh, for sure. Which is something that we also have massively struggled with in the past. And now we just brought in that new CSO. He started last Thursday and since then it's like units are like our units were like this and now our units are like this. Same lead flow, same team, same like whatever. And it's just like you know it was time. Um it was time. So I mean I need someone to manage that. Yeah. I'm gonna ask offline. I'm gonna ask you offline what the final deal was. Oh yeah, deal. We can do that. We can do that. We Yeah, it's good. We're good. Uh but we did land that and we landed the one we wanted which is good. So um there'll definitely be some churn. There'll be some new reps. They're bringing in some like sickos. But that was the other big conversation point was like okay and then here's one for you around low ticket and I I was going to make a video about this and I haven't yet. So the low ticket after analyzing it with all the data and thousands of customers now we've gotten in like a testing period more or less. We're selling 30, 50, 75ish a day, right? And it scales based on spend, but then the CPA is rising. We have not rolled out the AOV boosters and the order bump or anything yet because we had to get the products created. We're all about brand quality and it being good. So, we haven't had those completed, so we can't roll them out. So, AOV is literally just conversion rate basically, right? There's like or in relation, I'm sorry, net CPA is just conversion rate. There's nothing adjusting it other than how well the media buying works and the CRO of the pages. That's it. So, it creeps up. We started doing all this analyzing. 75% of the purchasers were people who were non-new leads. No way. It was acting as like a retargeting, bro. But that's that's the that's like but that also explains why the ascension was so high. That also So like it works. It worked for a war. Not but it's not going to 300 units a day. It's not going to 500 a day. It's not going to maintain 5% ascension. Did you end up excluding them from the ads after that? Yeah. So we Well, that was the other thing is the design of the page. One was built more almost as like we were confused why it's working so well and the other one was built more for cold. This one was built more for like oh they've already heard about it. They've already heard about us. It's more on brand color. It's not their first touch. So this one converts better here. So now we have a cold focus page and one and then now we're doing an excl we're doing like the exclusion version that's going there. And in the last two days we the CPA dropped like in half last half on the cold version. So like and then now we have it going on uh Google in a good way. That's that's set up. So yesterday was 67 low ticket units. So like we're trying to press this one now and then we're doing complete ideation from the ground up and we're that'll change our whole business. It'll change our entire business. That plus this closer. I mean like it sounds obvious but you know sometimes it's not. Just the close rate going to from right now 15 to 20 to 30 plus which is like the baseline that every single sales manager we talk to is like they need to be. They're doing a 16 question application. They're watching a 25minute DSL. They're doing like all this stuff. like your close rates need to be in this range. That alone sounds obvious, but like is crazy. Cuts your CAC in half. It's the same cost to get the bookings. It's the same cost to get everything and it cuts your CAC in half. Then you change things like these unit economics and like stuff right here and you get someone on the phone for under 100 bucks that's qualified and like has the consumption. Game changer. That changes our entire business. Yeah. Like I always tell people when you're optimizing your funnel um it's someone asked me this in uh Cole Gordon's mastermind. Actually someone asked Cole and then Cole was like Eddie what do you think? I'm like [ __ ] way to put me under on the spot. Um but basically how I optimize is on the outside in. So I go okay what's the last touch point? What's the first touch point? And I'm optimizing those first. Like example if I could drop my if I can increase my conversion rate on the page by 10% on the front end how much does that affect the funnel? on the other side. If I can increase my close rate by 25%, how much does that affect the funnel? And I'm basically working in to get to the middle essentially is probably the easiest way to do it. I talk about I go through like all the funnels and how they connect and stuff on this on YouTube like all the time. And I have everything in this master one that's like optin rate to app to uh to app rate to app to booking rate to show rate is a big one that was a big issue for us for a long time. Oh, show a big dude for 12 months straight. rate was a massive issue across the Yeah, I mean it's and that's same thing. It's around the optimizing, but then all the pre-urture stuff we've rolled out. Like we rolled out a couple new things and we were talking about at that round table, but we rolled out uh Jeremy Haynes talks about a lot and I talked about him because I think his videos are great and people can go to him, but uh he has the hammer them strat, which is the basically you have a a dynamic list of people that are booked but not had their call and just sync that into Facebook and then you have all these throughplay focused videos that have no direct CTA that's like authoritative, that's pre-objection block, that's long form testimonial, it's all these things. when they watch one, it excludes them from it and shows them the other ones. And frequency is like 15 20 and you just hammer them with like you're everywhere on their feeds until they get on the phone call. And then somebody uh talked about doing that for your leads as another one that's like authoritative one to get them to book the call but not like actually directly. And that is we just rolled that a week ago and that's like going really well. Show rates are six. How big is that list though? Tiny list. I mean, the lead one's probably bigger, but the the booked but not had the call yet has to be a pretty small list. Well, we technically do booked within 48 hours, so it's uh 500, let's call it. Let's call it. Um but yeah, it could be it could be more. Yeah. So, yes, but you and then you can expand it out because you can also just go who is booked in general out and then as long as you just exclude I mean whoever you want. But people have actually been on the call. Yeah, exactly. Why am I not pulling this up? But yeah, we have show rate has been steady like this. And then now we have setters doing confirmations instead. And I think we actually might move it back to closers now that we have this new manager in who's like you need to control it. But yeah, 50 58 61 52 show rate. Uhhuh. Isn't that still kind of low? Yeah. The these last ones and then prior to that, but that's all all if you look at the setter specific one for example, they're averaging 60 I'm sorry, 74. All right, that makes more sense. Yeah, I like that ones that are claimed, but the to the total blended. So, the issue is the ones that still don't get claimed. So, that's every single booking ever. Yeah. So, like that includes cancels, no shows, resched, everything versus like true live call. So, like it's kind of buffed, but yeah, you talk about the dedicated one and it's whatever 70 mid70s still, which has been a big win. So, yeah. But all to say low ticket with Ascension, that one's basically been working for warm. Now we're going to do one for cold that's full ideation completely different offer that actually would work on cold at scale which we've never done the DTA stuff that's very interesting around the pixel. Maybe I'll just set it up with them and just rip and just try and do that. My only thing is like we've been What are you doing with the disqualified people though? What are we doing with them? Yeah, letting them book on another widget that doesn't fire the pixel. Understood. But like what are you selling them? Same thing. You don't have like a 2K 3K for the people that have never spent a dollar on fitness like why not though at your volume bro you'd be doing an extra few hundred grand a month in net profit um cuz we don't have the offer. So right now we're talking about so that's all the front end. So those three are coming in those people that get DQed if the calendars are full go to low ticket. If the calendars are not full go to the group of goes to a roundroin group of either new or like not as performing reps. top reps get top leads and all the sets also go to the top reps and then these sit here and these kind of like churn them out work their way out of the you know the trenches the once they're in then we only sell one offering then now what we're rolling out is so far talk about leaky bucket issue uh we have had no other thing to sell them other than stay at the same basically the same rate we dropped it like whatever 10% 20% uh for them to stay which also the same cost for So this is where you and I start talking about like actual like return and gross margin on these things and like yes on year two there's no more ad there's no more sales rep but there's still the fulfillment and it stays the same but you're collecting less cash so it goes up as a percentage because we haven't had any other offers. Yeah. So tomorrow is the final meeting. I've said this like three times and but it has needed to be pushed back. But Monday, we're launching a we're Monday we're launching a backend program that's only for year two people, which is closer to what you're talking about, which is like a downell. We're going to do 4K a year or 360 a month to start. Is it is it supplementation involved? No, it's group. It's the same style thing, but group coaching instead of onetoone coaching. So you still have your community, you still have your access, you still have all these other things, but you have already you're required to go through the first year in onetoone personalization because you need that to like set the baseline, get your whatever, but you need the continued access for the continued access. And instead of needing the handholding that you needed on year one, you don't need that. And then the other thing is we're going to offer batched programs or like uh longer term stuff at the coaching for discounted but more in cash collected like I mean multi-year contracts. Yeah, makes So that will that will get there. But for front end, we don't have anything different other than these same things. I have an idea on your on your back end for your DQs, but I'll tell you it offline. I don't want to say it on here. Perfect. Yeah. And then the sub stuff. Yeah. I mean, that's that's in the cards, but we're not going to do that until we're at We said five or six million a month. We're going to I'm not kidding. Same flow, same everything. We're going to double just with better set. Especially Especially with what you figured out on the cold low ticket stuff. Like that's cold low ticket stuff. And I think we'll get that DTA actually working. But that's a better closer thing. This just turned into the Ryan show and that's not the point. But yeah, so there's a lot to go there. But go back. Let's Let's pop back. Let's pop back. What is the most you've ever spent on a party or event? That's such a funny question, bro. Um, probably like half million. This is Chad GBT pulled this from from I mean that's probably half a million dollars. That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, but you know, it's it builds brand, you know. I cover a lot I cover a lot of it with sponsors sometimes. Um I uh who's like I mean I guess you don't have to name exact company names but like what type of company would sponsor other people who want because you have your client base is what it's info coaching it's ecom it's some software it's local it's no not many software it's I mean only softwares that are like really high strong lead genen right um those are those are the main points of the business we have a local and lead genen yeah yeah I mean we have a local division um that that has you know 100 plus clients let's call it, but it's not like a primary focus for me as a founder at this point just cuz they're smaller. My my time is pretty much spent on info products and big ecom brands. So, ones that are doing at least like 30, let's say 20 million a year to $100 million a year. Those are kind of the accounts that I'm focused on, they have the highest leverage and upside for us as well. Um, but for the parties where everyone wants to sponsor them, honestly, like if you if you think about the one we just had in Vegas, there was 1,200 people there and the average person in that room was doing a few million dollars a year. the average like there's people that were doing 30 40 50 I mean Tai Lopez was there Brad Lee was there Ryan Penedo was there like uh massive companies that you don't even know who they are we're doing you're doing 50 $60 million a year we're in that room and so everyone wants that list everyone wants to put their name on a party like that so um once you do it once here that's mostly an info and coaching room right like the FA that one was yeah I'll do rooms that are just ecom rooms etc right so it's kind of based on who is where um but at the end of the day dude like the first one's the hardest Um because like no one knows what it looks like. It's a prototype. You're basically asking people for favors. Hey, trust me. I'm going to throw this awesome party, whatever. Uh and then once you do the first one, everyone's like, "Oh, I've seen these or heard about them or been to them. I want to I want a piece of the action." Yeah. And then I'm able to cover it. But when I spend 400, 500K, it's usually on my own event that doesn't really have sponsors. Maybe I have like 60 80k of sponsors, but I don't sell sponsorships intentionally um just cuz I don't want them to crowd the room. Um, and then I just do it by selling ticket sales. So, we'll sell 5 10k a ticket. We'll cover our cost and I won't take a loss on it. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. We've never done We've talked about doing them for customers and I'm sure some of your clients do event I mean I know some of your clients do like events and stuff for customers whether they're included in their high ticket stuff or it's like a separate thing. Uh, we've never done it and just like again logistic stuff. It's like same thing around events. It's like do we want to add the headache and burden for what return? And when it's more brand and stuff, we have cleaned out. I would I would and I would just hire someone and pay them like I mean I got some great people. All my parties are thrown by other people and a mix of them and my team. Um but yeah, I mean I got people I can connect with, but they I got to get better at that cuz same thing with like supplements. It's like, "Oh, we don't want to do this because it needs to be really high quality and we don't want to like waste the time and focus." And it's like that is same thing I said in the beginning like limiting belief around like having partners in things or like you're breaking them off a portion or something. It's like we just did that basically with sales at like they're in house but like we broke it off at a bigger rate than we maybe would have in order to just be like handle it, right? And like being able to do that with that with events, with subs, with other stuff could be a very interesting play that dude and that's that's my business philosophy as a whole to be honest. It's like, look, I'm I'm going to have partners and I'm going to get [ __ ] by people at the end of the day. There's Yeah, that's me. Maybe that's where I'm jaded. There's a percent that I'm just going to get [ __ ] on, and that's it is what it is. But I can't do all the things I actually want to do without burning myself out or overspending too much of my cash on employees that end up screwing me over anyways at the end of the day, unless I'm able to have partners. And so, if you already have the machine, you can go to a partner who can create those supplements for you and be a partner in that. That's a way better deal for you than sitting here having to manage it all because then you have to run every initiative down the field versus like, hey, here's what I want it to look like. And then they go, they do their thing, they come back. Is this what you want, Ryan? No, I don't want that. I want this is this. Cool. Go back. Give it to you. Yes. Yes. Yes. You're just approving and giving your direction, right? And they're like, that's the key. Yeah. Because I'm finally stepping more into like my whole thing's always been like tech systems and like some opsish, but like we've tried either project managers or whatever. And like now it's finally full-fledged. like I'm running the full ops there and like at the we have we have high level leaders to where I actually it's just running them right. It's like it's orchestrating that team. It's not actually like the teams below and we're getting to the point where the band was there and that's what like my last few videos have been about is like our new ops system, our new cadence and like we've got some killers that are like fully running their own stuff but internal and like it would not be much bandwidth shift to like also we have a external or internal events, we have an external or internal subs. It's like how they have cross division that I have to figure out. But do you have to pop in one minute or you got a couple more? I got a couple more. I can go I can go like five time over. All right. Crazy story time. We talked at dinner. No doxing. No names. Biggest launch ever. What's the bit in cash? Launch. I mean, not that crazy. I've done like I mean I've been a part of launches that are way bigger, but I can't take credit for my for myself cuz I just a part. But launches myself that we've ran. I mean, four or five million in like a couple days as part of Yeah. Still, yeah, we do those internal only, but we've never had anything like new customer that we've done. Like we'll do that renewal thing that we talked about where it's discounted heavily for like the second year, which again just eats into my margin straight up. But like but it's cash flow, but like it's cash flow. Um so, but yeah, we'll do two and a half million bucks in a couple days or whatever. Yeah, that's solid. I mean, um mine mine are all new customers. Um, yeah, I'd say like 5 millionish give or take a little bit is the biggest. We've done a bunch of those. Uh, have I done like 10, 20, 30, $40 million launches? Not personally. I've been a part of launches that were like 50 million plus. Um, but I was just a part, you know what I mean? So, I can't really take credit and be like, "Oh, we did that." Um, what are the what are the biggest what are the bigger I mean I know some of the clients but like what's the biggest company that you've ran their stuff or not their name or their person but like how what kind of volume like how big is the their annual numbers in info or in ecom? I guess both. Info or ecom? Uh I mean I guess both is around 100 million. Both have been doing around close to eight figures a month. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I like not 200 million but like 100 like between 70 80 to like 120. Yeah. What does Cardone say his numbers are? Uh whatever he says they are info coaching. Oh, as far as info coaching like his sales thing like I want to I feel like it was I mean it was definitely nine figures for for the Yeah. Yeah. There's no way it's less than nine figures, bro. I have people way more than Cardone doing over $100 million a year. Um so no way it's less. And uh this was public information so I can say it. But like that's what I'm trying that's what I'm trying to navigate right now too. I'm like where Yeah. Yeah. What I what I can also say public information is like you just for context Cardone even owned like 10X Health. 10X Health. Um Gary was talking about on one of his podcasts, but he went on the Joe Rogan show and they did I forgot the exact number he publicized, but uh you know, multiple eight figures worth of sales of just front-end lab tests in a matter of like a couple weeks, right? Um that's just front end lab test, not even the back end. And that's just I was one of them. I was one of them. So was Luke, you know? So that that's and that's like a fragment of the pie, you know what I mean? So, like I don't know. That stuff's crazy because you hear I would doubt that Cardone's doing between those kind of services and stuff like that. I would not doubt if he's doing like half a billion dollars a year. Yeah, I feel like his number was close to that. He cuz he talks about it sometimes and again, I don't know what he shares or doesn't, but there's other guys that are huge in the space that I know you have run for or currently run for that I'm like so curious. Like I know guys that are direct in our like our specific bucket of TAM you could call it that do hundreds and a major like and it's the full-fledged machine is what we're talking about that do hundreds of millions in our world. That's why I can think of one. I know people who do the exact like model of low ticket or like direct to cart that it's that's in info coaching. I know two off the top that are like 10 to 15 a month. Like that's just who I know. And then you we were talking to dinner, you're like, "Oh yeah, I know four more that you didn't even say." And it's like there are people cooking and there's people in my DMs. That guy, I mean, there's one that crushed he was the one he was the one who connected me with the two of the four people I did sales interviews for just because he watched the videos. He said, "Hey, everyone on my team is watching your videos and whatever." And they did 31 last year in info and I've never even heard of them. Yeah. You don't even know who they are. Yeah. There's so many people like that, bro. So many people. And the other thing, oh my god, actually I have to share this. There's a guy that does almost no paid whatsoever, almost all organic and they are so their margin because a lot of the time someone let's just like easy math someone's operating at like a three, right? So like 30% of it. So for us if our numbers are 30% margin on like a healthy whatever because so much paid the organic guys get like into the 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And like Ian publicly said his in a video. He's like, "Oh, I did 70% on 70 million." And it's like, you know, we did 70 million and we did not do 70%. Let me be very clear. And that 10 to 30 was a massive decrease. Dollars went up, but percentage went down. Yeah, percentage definitely goes down. Even us like and that was and I even take blame for that. Like we got fat and happy everywhere in acquisition, whatever. But so these guys are talking about it and they have this niche business that is in like uh in training like a sports niche and it's a little bit in person if you want as like this higher thing because they have an office and people come out but almost all of it's remote and they are doing size. They're doing seven figures a month right now. They have zero paid. Zero. Like you you should do their comp structures for their sales reps. They're such layups that they're like not even percents. You just get like a little chunk. They sell everyone on like monthly instead of piffs. There's no there's no incentivizing pips or whatever. The PIFF is the same price as the monthly as the monthly in-house payland. And I I get on a call with these guys and they're just badasses. Like they just have a good product. And like that was on your thing that this pulled for me. It is best marketing strategy is a great product. And this is something that you're quoted saying and it's like these guys crush and I actually want to talk to you about this offline because I you I might need to get you connected with them because they have zero paid and no setup and their backend monetization model is like entering stratosphere like similar to how uh I've run it for like life insurance guys that was info. They sell a 10K thing teaching all this stuff about like taxation and and and retirement and whatever and then inside it you use this asset and it's uh whole life insurance and then they make money as an insurance rep. Like think like that type of backend [ __ ] but bigger. Like there are some plays in this market that you can make. So yeah, I don't know. I mean do you see yourself where do you see what is it May? Now you're trying to decrease team count. Decrease your team count. Yes. Uh through what I'm actually doing, what I'm actually doing is decreasing the percentage of clients that I do business for for them and increasing the percentages that I do business for us, if that makes sense. Interesting. So like I'm launching our own offers and have already launched their own offers that no one knows I'm behind and no one will ever know I'm behind. Some of them they will, but most of them they won't know I'm behind. And I'm like, "Dude, why don't I just take like my talents and be able to do that for myself as well, bro?" Because here's a here's a sad part in the agency space is I was telling this to my partners like a month ago. I was like, "Dude, like we got into business to not get fired by a boss yet [ __ ] at the scale that we're at, we get fired every week." Yeah. You have hundreds of bosses. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, so I'm like, "What the [ __ ] are we doing?" Instead, you want thousands of bosses through customers instead. I mean, bro, I'd rather I'd rather take those customers who are like four degrees of separation away from me than the people who I actually talk to and care about and have direct relationships with. And don't no one that I actually talk to directly I have a bad relationship with. Even if we don't work out as a business because of the character that I have and the team and everything like we people who know us know what we do, right? We're not going to work for everyone. At the end of the day, it happens. 200 humans working for me, they're going to make [ __ ] mistakes. It's going to happen, right? But like if I could just control it and rip 10 million on an offer myself on, you know, 5 million net and keep that for myself instead of, you know, taking a small piece and a retainer from a client. I can do that way easier and I don't have to sit here bottleneck by the client now giving me content and all this other stuff. You know what I mean? So, I'm always going to take on clients because it's a great way to also diversify skill set. Like, I'm touching so many different funnels. I'm building so many different businesses. like it's very hard to replicate that even if I run my own offers. Um, and we do a good job and I have a great team and I don't want to let my team go, right? But over time, I'm going to transition, you know, instead of uh 2% being our stuff, it'll maybe end up being 30% our stuff, 70% client. So, we're just like a lot pickier with who we work with as a whole. Yeah. Cash flowing from there and then build. Yeah. I mean, that's that's the Craig Clemens, I think his name is model, right? With the uh what's that called? Golden Hippo. Golden. Yeah. Cuz he does that for ecom. So he I think the public one he says he's behind is Gundry but a bunch of others and it's just like you go to their website it's just all about hiring and people and whatever and they run whale ecom businesses and they just run the whole thing a toz and the whole thing just direct response like he has a video talking about how he created uh uh prebiotics like he created the word prebiotic like probiotic was a thing I think it was and he created it through VSSL that was so info and so well done that it was just like on YouTube normal and like Rogan put it on his podcast like oh you guys got to watch this and it was a VSSL. That's crazy. Goes hard. So, if you have that skill set and it's what we talked about at dinner and what we continue to talk about is like at a certain point, how fun would it be to do that? And you have the opportunity to because you're in there. But like for us right now, it's like we could incubate and try and do this, but it's like our TAM is so big. We are so small. Like just lean into what we have here. Distract your own offers. It would distract our own offers to do it. And that was the thing Luke talked about. I was like, "Oh, and like we almost did it, we're doing it almost now internal through other faces that'll have different like front-end offers and messaging that then can all funnel to the same back end." Yeah. So, it's just like a a zoomed in version of that. So, um, all right, that's basically all I had on here, but last one, advice to guys, internal versus agency, and pros and cons. and you can be quick with it because I'm sure you got a pop. Um, I mean, think about someone who's like smaller than maybe us. So, think of somebody who because a lot of people are and they get stuck. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. I mean, the pros are pretty obvious. Pros are the agency works with a ton of different accounts. They are they have the answers faster than someone you're going to hire internal. Um, let's just be real. Like, what media buyer are how much do you have to pay a media buyer that's actually spending $5 million, $10 million a month to come work for you full-time? It's [ __ ] impossible. You're going to pay them more than you're going to pay an agency. And quite frankly, that person doesn't need to be media buying for 40 hours a week. You know what I mean? It's just not a realistic scenario. So, uh I at certain levels, I would rather it take skill and the ability to have an entire team working for me for the price of like one person over having one person. Now, you get to a certain point where you have to start layering over the agency. So you need to get a marketing director internally probably at like 2 to 3 million a month where the internal marketing director oversees all the agency relationships and then slowly you can start bringing more people in house to do those roles. But like quite frankly, bro, like I mean like for example me, like I'm unhirable, right? Most people that are of this caliber of of talent and skill are also unhirable, right? They run their own agencies, they work for other agencies cuz the upside is bigger. And if someone works for me in an agency, I can give him five, six accounts and he can take home some significant money. If he works for one company, they're never going to be able to pay him what I'm going to be able to pay him because I'm working with six, right? Um so the advantages are there early on. I think um roles that are um more volatile, let's call it like ads and stuff like that at scale, you start bringing people inhouse because the agency guy is not going to spend 40 hours a week on your account, but you'll start needing someone to do so. But if you're doing um you know 5 million a year, 10 million a year, 20 million a year even um I I don't think it's really necessary to build that stuff in house. It's way easier um to do it externally. That being said, you obviously carry risk. you hire the wrong agency or you get the wrong media buyer. Um, you know, there is a risk to that. The upside on that same risk though is if it's an agency, let's say mine, you get a media buyer. Oh, this guy's not a good fit for the account. I got six more that are savages that are also spending money. Maybe I put two more on the account, see which one comes out on top. How much time internally if your media buyer [ __ ] you would it take to get unwind that. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? So, whereas like in an agency, I could be like, take them off, put these two people on, see which one runs it better, and let's take it from there. So there's pros and cons to each. I'm obviously biased. I run an agency. All my businesses pay my agency to run their marketing. So like I believe in it, you know what I mean? I believe in that concept. If I had to build an internal marketing team for every business, they would get cooked financially, you know what I mean? Yeah. No, no. Real. Yeah. I mean, and I've shared on here our journey of that, but what we I mean, Luke's spent up to 20 a day or whatever for a while for us and like up until that scale. Then we tried to do the in-house guys. We had like lead genen style people that were contractors. just they only had like one or two other clients, not agencies, but like whatever they were buying for us. Then we tried full agency. We had some that were like infospecific that we were paying based on net of like new cash minus ad expense basically like a spread and doing a percentage of that for a minute and then those guys got us up to big numbers but then CPA was slipping. They weren't as focused. There was no detail. It was like kind of just a relationship. And now now I think you work with one of my uh ex team members, right? Who does buying? Yeah. So now well then we moved to another agency because we're like oh it's creative. We need more output. We were paying I want to say 13% of ad spend. Yeah. And the CPA was increasing the entire time. So we were getting railed. I mean we were spending a million bucks a month. We were paying them 130 grand a month for ours with no contingency, no CPA, no targets, no KPIs, like just percent. Got railed and then we went back in house. Now we have CMO. We have Yes. Our our media buyers are contractors that have multiple clients. So like you kind of call it agency. Um but yeah. So cool. All right. Always good. offline about some of the backend stuff. I think it's uh I think you should consider I'll text you offline this weekend about some backend stuff. Okay. Where's our next event? Where are we going? You pick. I'll be there. Dubai with all only 18. It's your turn to pick. Not me. That's what we're doing. We're I'll create something where we can just have a group chat a bunch of info and we can take them all to Dubai. Bro, I'm down. As long as I don't have to go to Philadelphia, please. Yeah, we're not going to Philly. No. Luke makes us go to Philly, but that's just for just executive retreats. Never, bro. Please. Cool, bro. All right. Everyone knows where to find you. Everyone already knows who you are. But this was good. I appreciate you and we will talk soon. Peace.
