## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8hF1KdcZeE

What's up, guys? In today's video, we have a banger. We have Jackie Cow, Indexy, King of SEO, all the things. Jackie, tell the people what you're all about. Yo, uh Ryan, thanks for having me on. Uh but yeah, quick intro. Name's Jackie Chow. Do a lot of SEO. um got started in ecom actually and found my way to SEO mostly because e ecom your pain tolerance needs to be super high. I don't know if anyone's doing private labeling. It's disgusting. Um still doing it. Um probably won't do that ever again. So yeah, and I'm a huge victim of shiny object syndrome. So I've done everything and anything under the sun. Uh but yeah, excited to come on here, share my knowledge. probably and probably learn a ton of things from you on the info side as well. Yeah. Yeah. No, so my background with you is I have a buddy that I talk about here on all the time that does like random affiliate side stuff and he put me on to your when you were probably 60 70 days in to your like building in public. Um, and I got on that, got a software or like a plugin that would flip it and I listened to every single one through like 1 through 70 in a row. So like I got like super caught up to date with all of your stuff when I was living in PR. I just threw it up on a screen over here and just like would work and just listen to all of them over and over and over again. So, I got super familiar with all your stuff. Um, and yeah, so it's it's it's cool. It's like definitely out of my frame and my game, but I have a like vegan blog that I made for my mom that made like, you know, upwards of 5K a month when things were humming and good just from display ads. And then now it's like, you know, 2K a month or something with where everything for search for hers is going. But yeah, man, super familiar with that whole game. And then you obviously you do a ton of stuff around sharing, right? like you're you share the net worth update stuff. You have the what is it like a is it newsletter style? I don't remember where I saw it. If it's newsletter or tweets or whatever the month over month. Yeah. So I do um monthly revenue updates on X and then I do net worth updates via the newsletter. Um and yeah, that's that's probably my most popular newsletter um like of the month. And I do like maybe 12 a month and that is by far the most popular. Everyone signed on for that. Um yeah. Yeah. Cuz like I I think I don't know about your industry, but in the SEO space, people out here are not transparent at all. You wouldn't know like what their bottom line is, uh what kind of like net worth they would have. Everyone's just sharing screenshots of like topline revenue most of the time. So I thought I'd like flip the script, try that. and it's it's going relatively well, but I'm like I don't know if you follow You said you did follow the daily episodes. I'm like 500 something in. Yeah. I'm only at like 20K subs. Something's something's got I got I probably got to do something about that. But um yeah, we'll see. Yeah, but you have the depth, right? Like you have the the people who consume consume like your comments are hilarious and like you have the people who like, you know, essentially it's like daily vlog, right? Like they feel so close to you and they understand you or what you're up to. And so there's leverage in that if you can you if if there's use in it, right? If you want to use it. And I talked to someone about this the other day that was like, what's the goal? What's the goal? And like I have opportunities flying left and right. I hit the goal. The goal was 3 to 5K that are like in the space. It was to be able to access network and talent and things and like hit that pretty quick. And now it's like what's the new goal? And it's like is it cash flow? Is it like clout at some level? Is it like opportunity? You know, what is it? So I'm still navigating that. But um yeah, I mean I I love your stuff and I think the So like what's the current uh cuz I've seen some you've had some crazy stuff. You've had like the pump fund style fund thing that happened, right? Like you've had the um you have the service style agency, you have your whole portfolio, you have software, remember at one point like the republish thing. Like what's your current stack on what you're running? Um I I got a bunch of stuff. Hold on. Let me pull it up real quick. else. Um, last month, highest revenue was my local SEO software, which is like popping off. I don't know if you're following that. That that's kind of crazy. That was um out of left field for me. I was not expecting uh that kind of revenue. We did 34K last month on that. We launched like a month and a half ago, something like that. Um, that was a huge surprise. I do like 30K on OAF revenue which is just display ads type of thing. Um we go through a network and I drive a ton of revenue on the O of side agency. We got the private community of local SEOs. So that that is like kind of my first taste of success via the uh YouTube channel. So, it kind of proved out doing daily YouTube videos is worth it despite my low numbers cuz like a huge percentage of those people will convert to um a private community member cuz they feel so close to you and they trust you. So on so forth. Yeah. Stuff like that. Um I think yeah agency of software Amazon affiliate that's about it. Um that's about it. Yeah, but I'm I'm I'm down big, man. I'm down big. I don't know how long you've been following me for, but um I think year on year I'm down like 50%. It's rough out here for SEO. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, the my micro example is the blog, the vegan blog or whatever, and she doesn't do any of that stuff, right? Like it's just it just is what it is, but like from where it was, it's down 60 70%. So, I saw you do put an X thing on that was like all of them got group clapped or something like in your GSC or what what happened with that? Was that Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, so like a year ago they came after me like personally Google. Um, they went through my like anything that's connected to me and they just completely clapped all the assets on those accounts. Um, yeah, that was rough and but it is what it is. I mean I I game the algo for a living, right? So it's bound to happen. I'm definitely not doing things like straight. Um, so yeah, it's fine. It's fine. I don't know if you followed, but um the uh partnership stuff was crazy. That was like the most insane high of my life. When you uh so to give your audience a bit of uh background, what we did was we partnered up with like legacy media partners. We carved out an affiliate site for their website. For example, let's see, say you're like local newspaper like the Vancouverson.com. They have like huge super strong domain authority and we they're but but they're dying as a business. So, we'd approach them and be like, "Yo, um, are you guys down to post like supplement articles, OAF articles?" And we'd monetize like hard. And they'd fly straight to number one and we're able to like fill in the pockets for um uh we call that like paid uh sponsored rank and rents where we'd rank for something like best protein powder and we'd reach out to protein powder uh companies and they'd pay a flat plus percentage to be listed at number one. And those numbers were insane. I think the highest we've ever gotten for number one placement was like 50k per month plus 50% commission. Uh but those like those keywords were insane. Uh anyone in the supplement industry knows how competitive it is. Yeah. Interesting. So is that part of any of the the current numbers or is that like like what's Yeah, it's it's Yeah. the so that those the highest number I've ever gotten like per month was like 550k per month um in affiliate file stuff. But now it's it's it's dead. It's well it's pretty much dead. It's at like calculate it's 16 like 17k per month. Wow. Um it's rough out here, man. That's why I think in the SEO space you gota you got to pivot so fast. Um yeah. Yeah. I asked uh I asked some people like what they wanted to hear and one of the ones the main ones that stood out to me and I'll pull up all of them but one of the main ones that stood out to me is someone was asking uh like uh LLM SEO and that's funny and we just talked about this in like an info coaching we have like a small group that we talk or I don't have a small group I mean I got invited to a small group of people that are info coaching people and uh last week we were just breaking that down like how do you show up for whatever keyword and like right now most of us that are big enough do show up for our unbranded keyword um or key like whatever search, but not for women over 40 weight loss or like tips for women over 40. Like how do we get shown for that? So, do you guys do any of that stuff yet? I don't like offering stuff I'm not like confident in. I have to say with like a super high uh certainty cuz um yeah, so I'm I'm testing. I don't want to speak too soon, but if if I want to point people in the right direction, I think um a lot of Reddit stuff, a lot of Kora stuff, um you can and it's super easy to manipulate. I don't know if you guys are looking into that at all. You guys should probably do it tomorrow. So, what I would do, I don't know, let's give a info example. I don't know, best FBA courses right now 2025. All right, I'd Google that. probably a Reddit subreddit uh Reddit po Reddit post would come up on Google and I'd list my own course there via a proxy account and then upvote that massively by a ton of up votes and then send a ton of like fake comments adding on to that and if you appear on those type of uh Reddit posts you start showing up in the LLM. Uh, I think A16Z is starting to call it like GIO, so I guess we'll stick with that. But, um, that's they get to pick name things. Yeah, exactly. We're just making [ __ ] up at this point. But, um, yeah, I think that that's that's what people are saying is working. We're running to like a lot of tests at the same time, but it's not conclusive yet. So, I can't say for certain, but that's probably the direction I would point people towards. Yeah. For us in info coaching, like the the rule of thumb is like look at your Reddit threads. Once you're like if your show rates tank, it's like look at your Reddit threads. That's like a big thing, especially for the make money online guys because people start a thread that and it's it pops up for branded search and then as soon as you're right there, it's why it sucks. It's all the, you know, naysayers and then people that have already booked look you up and then they sit in that in between land and then they never show for the call. So like Jeremy Haynes talks about that a lot, but that's like the number one place that we see it is like as a direct KPI. Um, and then I'll even see it in like we have an automated bot between application and booking. So, applied or started the process but never even booked. And they'll message back and be like, oh no, I looked it up online and it's like and it's too expensive. And it's like where do they find it? Like we don't have it posted. And then you know you kind of look around like we rank right now for a Reddit thread that's not even about us and is not have it doesn't even have our name in the content. Nowhere on the page and and it ranks for us. It's like crazy. So yeah, that's interesting. the the the large the large language model one I think would be a big win over time because the amount of people that are now using it for search directly like I use it 80 90% of the time so that Yeah. Me too. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Um Yeah. Yeah. I think real quick for the Reddit stuff I don't think people realize how easy it is to game right now and how cheap it is. It's like five cents per up vote or something like that and you can get farmed accounts for like dollars at a time and you can manipulate anything on Reddit at this point. So, I don't know if you saw the uh news article that came out on Reddit, but you can even bribe mods on the subreddits that you're on and it wouldn't cost that much cuz these guys are like broke neck beards in like their mom's basement. It would cost like a,000 bucks and then you own that subreddit essentially. So you can you're done, you know, for a thousand bucks. How that's like a drop in the bucket for most of us. So then then you can control just about any narrative you want in that space, at least in your space. Uh it won't work in high competition niches like supplements or VPN or mattresses. But yeah, it's uh I think there's something there. Um at least definitely in your industry. But um yeah, I wonder if we even had like something cuz like in my head I'm like, "Okay, who can I just pay to like handle or understand that?" And I wonder if I'm sure there's an industry or a service or gap there because I know people who do like removal services and all that, but not like the other, right? It's like we only do it like reactively. If there's an issue, we you know, pull down versus proactively like build it out so it's in pro of you. Um, but that would be an interesting as a service because there's a lot of guys in like the info coaching MMO or whatever that it would probably do them really really well if they had something that was number one ranking on there or you know the number one ranking at least on the top Reddit or at for Reddit uh that was why it's amazing and like all these results these people got and all that kind of stuff versus oh this thing sucks or oh here's the cost of it or oh whatever which it is what it currently is. So that that would be an interesting model. Yeah. How much are you um how much you guys is paying for removals? Um not much. We We actually Is there like hundreds or thousands? Uh we had one issue with one that was not about us that was like a fake that we paid like high hundreds for. Okay. Okay. But we've never really had big issues with that. I've had issues with that of other people I've talked to or like been working with and they have paid like thousands and thousands and they've also had like bigger ones that are like full Google removal ones that they try and do. Um but I don't know. I don't know enough about that game, but like there's bigger players that have just constant like monthly just these things that I don't know. I just stay away from like we we've been pretty knock on wood like all good there. So, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've always been fascinated with your um the info and coaching niche. I was like, we're thinking if there's a way to spin it for our the uh local rank business, which is the local SEO software, where it's like we offer some sort of info coaching, but we run it at break even, so people use our software, if that makes sense. I don't know if you saw what the list kit guys are doing. That that's kind of crazy. So, I was thinking of doing something similar. Um, yeah, it's very it's very very common to do. Oh, it's super common. Like that's not even their main business. their main business like software in the background. Yeah, most of them fail to be honest. So, because they like bounce back and forth and they're not like focused on either one, it's like the info coaching either is like breaking even, barely making money, losing, it just kind of like bounces and then the software never gets the attention it needs to be like a product that can stand alone. So, like it doesn't fully work. But if you're doing it like lean model, like I had uh Brook Hiddink on here for example, and he talks about how they have theirs is all about uh like brand it's uh what's it's like US-based uh high ticket drop shipping essentially and he sells a course. They run it to a webinar funnel. They sell a 1 to 2k direct toart thing where they make money on the spread between ads and that purchase and then right there they upsell them to like build a full store for them or do whatever. And it's like a 10 to 25k ticket I think is the numbers. Um, so he'll upgrade them to that and then once you're in there it's like oh yeah and then sign up for the software to like you know basically find the suppliers and they own the software. So like even if Right. So like they'll they'll make money full like the majority of their money is info coaching like lives in that land but then they also make money on the software. Um Becker did it for Hyros like Oh do. Yeahro he Trojan horse the [ __ ] out of it. He um I mean way way back when it was like you know zaps and all this kind of stuff and just kind of sniping people. Um, but then he sold uh iron mastermind I think was the name of it. And I bought it. We were in there and it was like five grand. You get in and it was all about YouTube ads, how to make the VSSL, how to like structure a lean mean product and then like how to be, you know, mind, body, soul, like your individual self. And then as soon as you got in there, he was like, "But you got you should joy us. Like everyone needs to join Hyros." And then there's only however many hundreds I think probably of people in there max. But it was the whales. So like all the whales ended up using it. And then he barely did any time on the group coaching. It was a pre-recorded course and like a once a week call and then he just built Hyros and then he just shut it down on the front and then just kept the community for a while and then just built Hyros built Hyros and like but yeah that's the biggest difference is a lot of people don't make it stand alone like it couldn't stand alone like if it had if it had to do its own acquisition in any capacity that wasn't info coaching then they usually die something along the lines of like oh yeah you know like it makes six figures like all good and I honestly don't know if he's talking monthly or annual you never know with that guy so it doing either um in your industry. Sorry, I'm just like I'm hounding you at this point, but No, no, this is just open forum. We talk questions, you whatever. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Um in in your industry cuz some of these numbers I I I took a look at your YouTube channel like couple times this week coming up uh approaching this call. Some of the numbers are insane. Are these what what kind of profit margin are do people typically see in this industry? That that's crazy. Some of these numbers are insane, dude. I feel like a peasant. They're nuts. Why? Why am I here, you know? Yeah. I feel like I feel like for this my corner I feel like a peasant in my corner of info coaching, too. So, like, all right. So, I just got back from Iman's event in London yesterday. And uh the room and the iman structure of info coaching is there's like kind of like two. It's like and the simplest way to differentiate is like organic versus paid are kind of like the two is the big one. And then info coaching the idea being info is just like login access and like usually some hybrid thing with calls and then coaching is either like onetoone group coach something in that model right so he is like the king of doing this organic and info yes there's coaching but like not the level of coaching we generally talk about and then he also then leverages global talent which I'm sure you do as well but like that's not something we do. So like ours is paid. It's evergreen. It's onetoone coaching. So there's not like big launches when I say evergreen. Um so paid to evergreen to onetoone coaching. So higher costs and then all you know US and W2. So you add those all up and it's like my P&L is like and then you take his and you don't have to deduct any of that. And he's like 80% margins. William Brown was on there. He's making half a million bucks a month right now with 84% margins or something. Gez. Wait, they don't run paid? they so he just now I imman was talking about he just now ran paid for like the most recent event but majority of their stuff is not paid at all and even if it is it breaks either like you know he'll spend x amount make x amount back on registrations but they did you know I don't know how big his number but he talked about it they did you know eight figures in the launch that's crazy that's crazy the wrong industry man but there are so many people in the room that had his model more so so they have organic they take organic they push either to low, mid, and then right up to high, right, is basically kind of like the thing. And then majority of them have worldwide talent and whatever else. So, it is very common in that room to be 50 plus% and probably like 70 plus% and they're doing hundreds of thousands a month. Everyone, everyone in that room. Crazy. Yeah, there's some beginners. Okay, that's not fair. There's some beginners and stuff, but like, dude, it was it's very interesting. And they all run that model. Iman's kind of the only one who's really doing like the hardcore events uh like consistently like that. Like, he has a machine built around it. Um, but there were guys in the room that, you know, spend I'm trying to remember the exact numbers. I don't want to botch this, but it was basically over it was a 10x uh rorowaz spent whatever he spent close to 100 grand on this launch. Sold a 5k ticket on the end of an event and made like 1.5 million like made like 15x and yeah, so it's an interesting game. Uh, the big thing is the that LTV to CAC, right? Is the LTV to CAC. if you can make more money after you acquire them. How long do they stay in the system? Is there retention? Is there recurring? There's guys that run a very identical business model uh in terms of like paid evergreen through a VSSL call funnel, buy a high ticket thing and then it's performed through like a course and basically group coaching style or onetoone coaching style but their ticket is like 25k and ours is like you know a little under 10k and they have retention that's crazy cuz it's like you know it's the cool kids club it's the boys club and their math is like insanity. Same thing with them. It's like they they lose 30% on their margin because they, you know, 3x row as call it because they spend and it's all paid. But then they have all those other pieces. So they'll do 40% margins, 50% margins and they'll do 30 million last year. So it's like and what what sorry I'm kind of new to this, but what exactly are they typically selling in terms of like what are they giving? Yeah. So let's build one in your example. So it's like okay, so like what I've seen about yours there is in that example for what they're doing is they're teaching like uh cryp theirs is crypto education is what their specific one is. Ours is women's fitness. Oh, I think I've heard of those guys then. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And they're and they're cool. And Tan was on here. So Tanger was on here and he's the guy I'm talking about, but they like crush. Um but for your model cuz you're right now what you're selling the community. It's like some low ticket monthly recurring. Uh so there's two things. There's one community that's doing pretty well does like at its peak probably 100K per month. Right now it's at sat at like 30 something per month. Um and it's what like it's literally just a slack channel and then like a a course and people love being in there. It's kind of like the cool kids club in the SEO space. Um people are more open to sharing in there. Yeah. It's pretty savage in there. Yeah. Like the people [ __ ] they talk about. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's amazing. So like yeah that's the info coaching business right is like that. So that would be considered oh I see. Yeah. So that that's how we would look at it is like okay so that's info coaching. Now that example of like they join and the first thing they join is that a lot of these trading communities are similar to that. So they'll join and it's like they get access to the how-tos and the whatever and it's just done for them. They pop in there and it's $50 a month $100 a month $300 a month whatever and they just sit on recurring. So you have this big MR engine and then where those guys monetize it on the back is like the education is on the back. So, it'll be 5K, 10K, whatever. Inside your Slack, you'll have one thing that's like get more access or like work one-on-one with you or work one-on-one with your seuite or your operations team or whatever. And you pay 10 grand and then you're going to, you know, fasttrack essentially to do that. And then that those two combined, this all of a sudden starts to make up a massive amount as a percentage of revenue because even though it's like way smaller units because of the spread. So, instead, you change that to whatever dollar value month. um it's gated and then there's either different tiers or different levels of implementation is the big one. So, like you're trying to teach them all how to get XYZ result in SEO and now there's just a login access, do-it-yourself, figure it out, navigate the community, and then the implementation is like, "No, I get to work one-on-one with Jackie." And it's like, "Oh, that's 50 grand." And then it's like, "Oh, I get to work with Jackie's team, that's 25 grand." Or, "I get to get on a group coaching call with Jackie. Oh, that's five grand." And like, it's that tier is usually how it would be to do it. And um my buddy who did the FBA courses, he said to have closers. Is that is that common? Like you have some dude like some killer who just hops on. It's like, "Yo, push them along." Like that that type. It's very common. It's a little different sometimes with the when they're inside already. So with yours, we call that like an ascension funnel usually. So like they join through one thing, you just pump every, you know, the most common way would be you have all your YouTube stuff. It's long form, people feel like they know you and you just fire them off either into a free group or a very like a low ticket paid group. Once they're inside there, then they join. They ascend. So, you have different activation points. You have different, you know, people strer someone that lives in there that like snipes the people to have these other offers. And then usually if it's anything over like $2,000, you want to talk to them on the phone. There's guys who crush it and send like 10k payment links and whatever, but that's kind of like a little less normal and definitely not normal for cold. So, like same way. So, like ours is like a VSS. We have different uh opt-in funnels, but essentially they'll watch VSLs, do this, they apply, and then book a call and they talk to a closer before because anything over twoish thousand, you generally are not going to sell like direct to cart like someone just buys it on their own. So a 10k offer, 25k offer, whatever, they want to talk to someone and then they just like, you know, help them understand why they aren't doing it on their own already. You already have access to all the information. You can do this on your own. Why haven't you gotten the result? And it's like, oh, because I need the personalization. I need the handholding. I need the accountability. I need the whatever. And it's like, okay, cool. For 10 grand, you get this, this, this, this, this. And they're like, and then they move to the next. Huh. Interesting. It works really well. You have the clout for it. You have the like authority for it. Yeah. I just want to be I'm I'm sure that you get this a lot, but what people I'm afraid to like charge too much because then maybe they don't extract max value as a I'm sure that's exactly why I don't do it. I'm like, I take 10 grand. and I have to like, you know, I'm not going to sleep until someone makes 100 grand. So, like I refuse to do it right now. But yeah. And one thing I've noticed is uh at least chatting with a bunch of people with these uh info coaching businesses is that do do you notice that people who go through these funnels like 90% of them don't take action afterwards. It's on them. They don't do anything. I that's a real real thing with info. Not as much a thing with coaching. So info Yes. where someone buys a course, whatever the Tony Robbins quote is, it's like 92% of people that buy his products never even log in. Like it's some crazy stat like that. Like that's maybe, you know, yeah, stats are made up on the spot, ladies and gentlemen, but um it's some crazy number like that. Um but coaching, not so much. And like the Pace Morbs of the world, like they have entire like consumptionbased SDRs that literally like hit people up that as CS reps that are like can see how much of the videos they've consumed if they've logged in. and they'll dial them until they get them and like, "Oh, you haven't completed module one. Make sure you get in there." So, they press on getting people to consume because they know that they have the ascension track that once people do XYZ, they then buy the later [ __ ] and they make more money later cuz they already made their money on them buying the info. But where they really make money is them ascending up the tranches of this. So, yes, it's very very common for I mean, me included, right? Like I bought some paper call thing the other day and it's like it's out of pocket. I'm like, I don't want to do that right now. and I just like logged in, looked at some stuff, and I logged out. And it's like, you know, like it happens. Um, but with coaching, it's a lot different because with coaching, so ours for example, it's like they buy on the phone before they're even off the phone, they are now scheduled in with an onboarding. They sk they, you know, talk to a CS onboard, then they get brought over to a coach. Now with a coach, they have onetoone access to them. They have a monthly, you know, cadence of this, twice a week of this, this, this, this, and they get like the most amount of handholding. That's what they're paying for is the accountability, handholding. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Huh. Yeah. Still on the still on the still on the uh fence about this, but we'll see. We'll see where Yeah. No, no. And there's skezy ways to do it. And there's like clean, clear, white hat as can be ways to do it. And I I'll be honest, like I don't know necessarily where I sit on it either sometimes because like I don't like the whole coaches teaching coaches how to coach people. Like I don't like that and like making money by like I I steer as far from that as possible. But I know a lot of people who crush this in using these skill sets and the stack of like info coaching, fulfillment model, and then uh internet marketing to get customers, but they do it in a different like niche, right? It's not a coach selling a coach. It's, you know, ours, it's fitness, right? It's like completely it's it's like outside of the make money online space. It's the make money online stacked on top of the make money online that gets a little gray area to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you What are you What are you like currently working on that you're most passionate about? You said fitness, right? Yeah. Yeah, our main code that you can talk about. Sorry. Yeah. No, no, you're good. No, no, you're good. Our main code is a women's fitness thing, so whatever. 30 million in cash collected last year. We broke everything under the under the sun. Broke and got down to like a million and a half a month, hit three last month, scaling back into it, and we're just trying to like speed run to 10 million a month. Um, and then that's like core business, golden goose, and then now everything with X and YouTube. I really just did this for like talent and like friends to be honest, like network and random stuff. The opportunity inflow is just insanity and like I don't I don't know what to do with it yet. Um, I have no idea what to do with it. So, yeah, I have some stuff cooking, but if I do that, then it like, you know, maybe I just don't want to hurt the main thing. And this is already I don't want to say hurting it, but like already kind of like pushing the mind and distracting to do this other stuff already. And I don't love that. Um, so I'm going to slow down on the videos. I'm not going to do daily soon. Um, that's why I'm thinking too I'm not doing It's hard. It's hard. man. But I think, you know, I think people just starting out, if they want to get into this type of industry, like make money online, and you're already crushing it, man, I' I'd recommend them just create content every day, cuz then it's it's so easy right now to just pop off cuz if you're not dumb and you see like, oh, this video is doing well, this video flopped, just do more of the ones that are doing well and eventually you'll hit a hit an area, even if it's under I don't know like 2K subs. I've seen a guy in the info space making like 100k per month with like 8K subs on YouTube. Oh yeah, dude. Organic zero paid by the way. Zero pay. I How do they even do that? I'm doing something wrong, man. Dude, dude, if I Yeah. One, I think your monetization model is broken for what your what your following is, what your authority is. Like, dude, what I would pay you on certain stuff. Like I think I think there's like a offer monetization model thing that you if you want to again like you said you're kind of back and forth on it. So like you're doing exactly what you want to do. So it's not like a blow at that. But I was talking to someone this morning. They're like how much do you think you could like turn yours right now? And so I'm at five six whatever thousand. I could easily make over 100,000 a month. Yeah. With the opportunity flow. Easy. Yeah. For sure. Easy. And it's like I you know again it's not like beginner friendly. That's why it would be able to do that because I have I mean I have tens and tens and tens and tens of like I you know take a percentage of this or consult me on this or how do you do this or I'll pay you five grand for an hour or this and like I could just build a community. I could build a course. I could do a percentage thing and like I want to go upstream and I don't I like say my videos I'm like I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. And it's like kind of hormosy-esque of like where you get clout almost for or like hate that [ __ ] word. I just don't have a better one for it. like how you can but like how you can have like the authority and like goodwill with the market and I don't want like I don't need the money from that like I don't need it from that but it's also like I'm also I'm missing out on what I could do with it so it's how do I make deal how do I do deals with these people how do I get percents of these things and like be paid for that in that way not that's like oh buy my 5k thing or like oh pay me 10k and you can have an hour of my time and then go hopefully 100 scale do like partnering on stuff. I think that would be Yeah. Have you thought about that? Like cuz that's where um most of my money was made was through partnerships with like other SEO people cuz they they're like experts at networking. I'm I'm like hard on the spectrum, dude. I can't I am so much on there. It's it's terrible. Uh I can't like I I hate networking events. Some of these guys, they're they're great. They're great at that. So the opportunities I get just from YouTube is like by itself worth it. Like if you stop everything all other revenue sources, that's it's it's golden. So yeah, that's kind of my goal is like how do I take percent like I have a couple business like I have two direct that have come through that are like yeah I would take I would take that deal style and then I have like three or four other ones that I put on a short list that I'm like if they would give me whatever percent profit share revenue share whatever the thing is and I just did like a coaching call with them style. So, it's like monetization model. It's still consulting, but it's like instead of a flat fee or not, it's like strictly performance basically. And then the fulfillment is instead of me like in there and like running in like managing team or whatever is just like once a week coaching call. I would love that. And I think I could I think I would I have the awareness or skill set or whatever to take people that are three to 500k to like a million a month. It's just pushing the ball and it's just stuff that we've already run through the gambit and like we know. So, I think that would make hundreds of thousands a month. Nice. Um, what do you We're in like the greatest bull market ever seen in uh in history. What are you What are you doing with your money, dude? Nothing. I I love asking people this cuz people aren't that really. You're just on cash? No. No. I'm just like, yeah, I I said majority cash right now. Um Hey, no way. Are you serious? Yeah. I did the I did the Puerto Rico thing for the last 3 years, so I had like the no tax zone for us. Um, so, so you're back, are you back in? Yeah, I'm outside of it now. So, I just got back into like mainland US and uh, so I had to sell everything. I had to like reset basis. I had to do all of that like end of year and I basically bought back like a majority of anything that was in crypto there. Um, some of the stuff in markets I like, you know, basically sold, rebought so I could just reset basis. Um, but anything other than that I just literally moved all cash and it's just been sitting there. And it also was a perfect time for when the business had its big like pain point and we started we stopped like doing distributions and stopped doing all that kind of stuff because it was in like a rough zone cuz for us like if we're doing like a million and a half month that's like break even basically. Um so the cash flow actually stopped right for me. So again, plenty way too much uh sitting in cash, but like it was nice to have that sitting there versus like fully spread out everywhere and being like like I need to do that. Like I don't need to do anything, right? Because I was sitting cash he heavy. Like even emotionally I just felt like good about it. Um but yeah, I mean I have a I have a decent chunk uh for me at least in crypto that just sits there and mainly ETH because it's just I've had it forever and just bought stuff like that. Uh, I was in penguins way early. Like one ETH I was in penguins and then didn't sell them and then got, you know, 250k airdrop and then didn't sell that and now it's worth like 40 G's. Um, what else? Uh, just a bunch of [ __ ] like that. And then I've I've never I never got to the point where cuz I was in the PR thing, it didn't make sense or wasn't like a necessary action to be like real estate or this or that because it was all just like the online portion just was fine. Um, and then when I got back here, I was like, "Oh, I'm I'm going to focus on it at least enough that I can like park in real estate and do this to like offset tax." And then it just hasn't been an issue because uh we haven't turned enough cash to where it's necessary. And also, I'm kind of like, do I really want to focus on that and like try and learn how to do that and own a bunch of physical [ __ ] when I hate physical [ __ ] And so, I just haven't my my mind hasn't gone to that bucket of like, hey, now I have like so much of a surplus in new cash flow because it hasn't really, you know, you know, formulated for this yet. that I need to do something about it. So, yeah, I I'm not a fan of real estate, actually. It's kind of boring. I don't I don't know about you, but it's boring. Definitely boring. Only reason I would do it is for the taxation portion, which again, now I'm like, "Oh, should I just move back to Puerto Rico?" Like, it's right there in my head. I'm like, "I might just do it." Yeah. Yeah. It's hella boring. And it's like, it's not headache free as people make it sound. Um, it's tons of headache. I I hate it. I hate it. If I were to do everything again, I'd probably buy zero real estate. Um, really just uh I have that place in Portugal that's doing well, but everything else is like subpar. Just below uh market. Yeah, you live you live a wild life. I mean like I I not this last one, but I think the one before is the last like net worth whatever update thing I saw. Um and like you're just you're everywhere, right? And then like I watch these building publiclix and you're physically everywhere. Like you bounce around like crazy. Um like what's your what's your like approach with that? Cuz you just got married, right? Yeah, I just got married. We're we're settled in Vancouver now, though. Um Oh, okay. That was that was my ne that was negotiated with my wife. Um I said, "Yeah, I'll move back to Vancouver." I was in Germany for like seven years. Um she's like, "You have to move back." I was like, "Okay, but we got to travel for two years." So we did that. Um and then now we're back here for good. So Okay. Yeah. It is what it is. But um yeah, the the two years was fantastic. Um cuz I was pretty much we're just doing everything whatever we wanted. Uh like fivestar hotels the whole time. Uh it was Yeah, it was great. It was great. But yeah, that's amazing. Yeah. Pretty You do get tired though. You do get tired. It's It's not like What do the day look like? Cuz I I heard I hear you in some of these videos and you're like, "Oh yeah, then we're off to go do whatever today." Or like, "Oh, literally didn't have time yesterday because we were going back and forth or we were in transit from this then this then this." So like the daily was just you stay somewhere for a week or two, you plug in for a couple hours a day and the rest of the time is you guys go and sightsee or meet up with Yeah, I think when I'm depends on Yeah, pretty much plug in for a week and then we sightsee. Uh weekends I probably work an hour. Weekdays I probably do 4 to 8 hours. Um but I wake up early so that's like the side people don't see. I'm up at like 600 7 a.m. So, crush it. And then then we go out and explore stuff like that. It's It's pretty damn tiring. So, I have to be in bed earlier. No. Uh can't can't have too much to drink. Can't have too much wine. Um if we meet up with friends, oh, got to go home early, you know, a big day tomorrow. Stuff like that. Um but it's fine. It's fine. I think uh to the young people out there who've made it probably definitely get out there. Um, the people I met on my on my travels have been incredible. Yeah. Yeah. I just made a video yesterday that was uh how isolation cost me millions or whatever. And it was like I just got back from this event. It's like in I I'm such an introvert and I just have been in the cave. The one in London, right? You said Yeah, that one. And like once How much was that? Sorry. 20 uh or I'm sorry. I think you were selling it for 25 25 to the public and then it was like 10 or 20 or something included on top of your 10 or 20 that you already paid for ADFL like these other ones. So yeah, it was definitely up there. But there were some whales in the room like whales. And yeah, so we hung out with all them and then we left and then went to downtown lending because it was like in the countryside. You're just doing the math in your head. It's like yeah now it's like 5 million probably a year a day. Um, but so going from that to downtown and having a couple people we met from there and then them being like, "Oh yeah, then we'll bring so and so." Next thing you know, I'm at like, you know, Paddle or Podel or whatever with like some sickos. They invite us out to a dinner. It's two or three more sickos. Then we go to this lot cigar thing and then more people. And I'm like, "Wow, like I just missed out on this." I never I've never done anything like that in my life. Like really never. Like I've gone to a couple lead genen conferences and it's like oh so and so know so and so or like the chandelier bar do stuff like that. Like that's probably the closest I've been to that. But in terms of like info coaching land or that kind of space like I just haven't. Um and I definitely not the travel part. Like I just don't like I'm not I'm not the guy who goes and looks at the waterfalls or like wants to go and do thing. Like I just don't work with that. It's just per like it's just not a fan. Um, but I've leaned too far in the other direction where it's like too far and just I sit at this desk 16 hours a day or I don't leave wherever I live. And it's insane the conversations that we had. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. Why don't you host it? You can host it. I know. I'm kind of like in that of like where I could or would. Um, I had some conversations with them about it because like I like what they're building there. I think that those are some good guys. I think they're getting the right people in the room. But I'm in like, for example, I'm in three or four of those versions of those groups. They're kind of the only ones who are doing info coaching specific. The other ones have some lead genen or some affiliate like kind of pullover, but I'm in like two or three different affiliate chat of those on Telegram. Um I don't know. Just comes back to like what you're saying is like does it should it be monetized? If it is monetized, what's the price at where it's like people take it seriously, but also like it makes sense. I don't really want to sell anything, but I want all those people in the right room. you do an event, you know, those things cost hundreds of thousands of dollars when done right. Like they crushed the event. They did such a nice job. Such an they rent out the entire mansion and like the whole hotel, like all the grounds were all just for the 50 people that were there. Like it's crazy. Sick sick. Um yeah, I I I've tried doing versions of that. Well, no, not even close to that, but I just threw meetups, but those even those cost a lot. Like I I was spending like 10 G's. I was fronting it. I was like free. Everyone anyone who's killing it can come go through an application process. My EA does everything. Uh only killers in the room. And we brought together like some insane people. Spent like 10 G's on drinks. Um I don't know. I I definitely no ROI for me, but that was fun. It was great. Um you know what I mean? Um that was great. 4 in the morning. It was at like 4 in the morning and we're all sitting outside still and then uh like half the room. So it's probably 10 20 of us still which is crazy behavior just sitting out there at the thing and uh all of a sudden they come out with like bottle service like not like full bottle service but like the the chest the they come out with ice chest and it has like four bottles in it and this and that and like all the mixers whatever. It's 4 in the morning. I'm like what are you doing? They're like oh we had to hit the minimum or whatever. It's like yeah it's crazy behavior. Like the drinks add up. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. But the event was good. How you said it was 50 people. Yeah, it was probably 50. Yeah. Or so. So that's crazy. Yeah. And then you have the people who like probably didn't necessarily pay like some real real big hitters that were just like invited that are his good friends that brought a bunch like you know thirst Mike Thirstston's there. Um super super nice cool guy. Uh Dave Fogerty so big the Australian and big ecom guy. Yeah. So like a lot of those guys were there. Um which are just like his friends and you know it was just it was cool. It wasn't like everyone like rushing around certain people which you get at bigger events with kind of like the different authorities. Um yeah, they just put together a great thing. But no, I would definitely be it's potentially in the cards for me to build something that's similar to that or partnerships or something to where cuz that's definitely what my audience or whatever has become or what the crowd is. So I think that could be good. But let me pull up some of these questions. See what else we got in here. So the people you and I are just jamming and I love it. Yeah. Um all right, next one on here. SEO rank and rent versus pay-per- call. So, have you ever done any of that stuff for paper uh like lead gen style for paid? Yeah. Yeah. For paid. Um like I guess like yeah, you have you have right you have rank you have SEO rank and rent, you have paper call, you have you know lead forms, you have all this kind of stuff when it comes to like lead genen bucket and then you have paid versus organic. Like have you ever done the paid version ever? I have. Yes. Um, but those are typically what we run those as is like break even. So what we do is let's say I have a rank and rent let's say in roofing in Vancouver. All right, I signed someone for two grand but the rank and rent isn't ranking yet. So I just put that two grand into paid while we wait for the Google side to rank and then we start cutting back spend as the rankings go up, stuff like that. Um, there's there's a ton ton of tricks you can do. Uh we actually actually flipped out of um the largest towing directory in the US beforehand, but that that got too sketchy for me. Um so we had like a massive towing directory. Uh people can look it up. It's like completely clapped now. Thank god I sold it, but it was called towinglist.com. Um but halfway through I realized, yo, I'm I'm calling a bunch of guys on going on sales calls for them to rent out like the East Coast. I realized I'm talking to the same guy and I'm pretty sure that guy is part of the mob and I was like, "No, I'm out. Like I'm I'm good on this. Uh probably got to flip out of this because he's starting to make like very subtle threats and I was like, no, I think for this I'm out." Um so I sold it. It was uh yeah, halfway through I was like, "No, probably not the industry for me." I didn't know to was like that. I thought it was more um white hat than that. But um apparently in the US people can just tow your car randomly and then just bring bring it to the uh Yeah. Um especially in some of those areas uh less Yeah. where it's more pretty savage. Pretty savage out here. But um that was crazy. That was a crazy one. What you typically need to do in rank and rents is get a Google location verified. If people want to get into it, just get it get it verified. I don't care how you do it. Just do it and the calls will just start flowing in. It's that easy. Especially in small cities like tier two, tier three cities. Yeah. Done and dusted. Just get it verified. The guy that initially sent me your stuff um that's a good friend. He slowly but surely has been building those up. And so he has however many tens I think now of like Google My Businesses set up that are all running to different things and pick whatever industry call it, you know, roofing because that's what we talked about. They're not roofing but and he sends me a thing. He's like making three to 5 hundred bucks a day just sending the calls through networks. Yeah. He he'd make more money if he went direct, but it's just so low. Like you don't have to do anything with these call networks. But um Yeah. Yeah. Cuz he tried to send some stuff. We have mutual people basically, you know, like let's say we had a friend that owns a roofing company in this example, um which is what we have but for a different niche. And then he had these coming in but like they weren't the business wasn't converting them correctly, right? And that's the other beauty of like a call network or one of these networks is they run them through these call centers that are like really hard conversion focused. Um but you still make less. So I guess it doesn't really matter for you because you don't care about what the quality uh or what the conversion rate is. You care about what your cost your you know rev per lead is. But yeah, he's got whatever 3 to 500 bucks a day just like passive now from that. That's awesome. That's awesome. From watching your stuff, it's actually that easy. That's the worst part. Um you know what's even easier? If you go to out go outside of the US like Australia, uh, Canada, UK, so easy. Like I've never seen anything like it. I think we ranked someone in Berlin, Germany. It roofing keyword. So in two days or something like that. I just did it as a case study for my friend in Berlin. It was that easy. And he he just picked up like a 150k deal for roofing in Berlin just from that. It's like can't can't even believe it. It's uh I I can't believe um people aren't more on this right now. Maybe I don't know why. Maybe it's just like confusing. I don't know. Yeah, I'm trying to take that same friend. I'm like, dude, like I own, you know, XYZ. I own insuranceclients.com or I own this and that. Like, let's try and like do something here. And he's like, ah, no, like I don't [ __ ] with paid. Like, I just don't need it. Like, why would I do that? And then I have to worry about the spend and the volatility and all this. I'm like, yeah, you're not wrong. I was like, but I just want to add two two zeros to the ad budget. And he's like, yeah, no. Okay. Um, okay. So that's the So I think that's what he meant then probably on SEO rank and rent verse paper call because paper call you know is we've had guys on here like Carlos um we had Adam Young on here who owns Ringba like those guys and they're just paid juggernauts. Those are guys are spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands a day towards paper call. Oh really? Oh yeah. What offer? What offer is that? You're so funny. Um, so the so there's like on the online world, how I see it at least is like all this, there's like the SEO guys, there's the agency guys, which are tons of different services, there's info coaching, and then there's like lead genen affiliate uh, and SAS. I think there's that's it. But these lead genen affiliate guys, you're one of the only ones that I've personally followed that do like the search or like do the the organic version of that. Most of them do this paper call thing. So, like I have friends that literally spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a day on uh debt, Medicare, um uh I'm blanking right now, but you know, all ACA, like these different ones, um final expense leads, whatever. And they'll spend 100 grand to make, you know, 20% margin, and they'll make 20 G's a day in profit on something like that. They do it then, you know, they'll do side quests and do the affiliate offers where they just rip and pump like ClickBank offers. And you know, I know guys that do half a million a day with those when they're hot and that's just their game. So, they just crank that, but it's all paid advertising. So, it's all Meta, Tik Tok, um some Google PMAX style stuff. You know, I'm not a master of that game, but they'll do that and then they'll do paper call or they'll do direct toart affiliate or they'll do um uh lead forms. So, the paper call stuff is like super hot right now, but it's whatever. After 120 seconds, you get paid 19 bucks. And it's like how many of those you generate a day? They have 19 buyers. They use Adam Young software, Ringbud to route and do all this kind of stuff or retriever or whatever. And that's how they do size. And then like I know guys who have sold those companies for 50, 60, whatever million once they package them up because they just have consistent acquisition. Wow. Wow. Man, this it's such a different industry, huh? So interesting. Here the other side of it, man. That I I this is what I always say with the SEOs. These guys think way too small. They're like happy with their like in your in your industry, these numbers are insane. Like the SEO guys are happy with 10K a month, but because they're like 99% profit, right? Part Yeah, that's the insane part is like for I literally was sitting with these guys and they were in uh in when we were in PR and they were like, yeah, they were telling me about the first time they ever spent 100 grand a day, I think it was. and uh 100 grand a day, but they were had been spending five grand, seven grand, got up to 10 grand and they were hanging out with this whale that spends like seven figure days and has like multiple across multiple things and like different niches and whatever. And he was like, we were partying and he just goes, "Add a zero to your ad budget and don't open your laptop for a day at a zero, right? You're spend 10 G's a day now spend 100. Just let it go." I'm like, "What?" Like and that's the crazy part is it literally like it doesn't it's not that easy necessarily but like he they did it and they they add they added a zero and he's like halfway through the day we checked and we were like a little bit lagging but we were basically breaking even and by the end of day it like broke through and this is probably whatever four or five or probably longer than that five six years ago that these guys would have been doing this but the scale in which you can take these things when they're in like these blue ocean style markets and the the size of them or like I had Carlos on here and Carlos gets to the point where he now has all these people that buy traffic then through him. So, it's almost like brokerage style. So, they'll do they do uh on Harry's I could say over 100K a day uh essentially, but they do over 100K a day through their own media buying and then their network of other media buyers all through to that's all and it's all paper uh paper call. So, it's um it's final expense, it's auto insurance, it's debt, it's refi, it's all that stuff. Crazy. Crazy. It's crazy. And it's lead forms and routing pages. It's a It's a quiz lander to uh yeah, you qualified. Click this call. Click the call. Call it. It's a ring tree or whatever it's called. And then it just goes to the different buyers. This one pays 19 per call. This one pays 23. This one pays, you know, only on revshare. They route based on who's available and which one can pay more and like what like and that's how they play. Man, this is like it's this is such a painful call for me because now I want to go and research [ __ ] whereas I should be doing actual work on my businesses. This is rough, man. This is rough. Well, here other question. Are blogs still worth it? This is a good one. Um, yes, but um I think most people don't do it right. Uh, most people are like blast because of like the prevalence of AI content. People are just blasting it and that's instant like you get clapped instantly. Yeah, Google has like such such strict filters now. Um, pretty much TLDDR is Yes. optimize properly now. Um, go through something like Neuron Writer on AppSumo. Very cheap. Get it going. Run it through once. Try to do maybe one, two posts a day. That's it. Don't do the hundreds of posts a day you see on X. That [ __ ] does not work. Um, especially on most of your most people's domains. If it's very weak, like your your domain is blacklisted immediately. Um, it's like destroyed. So, what what we do when we're spamming in the black hat SEO space um is we find a super strong domain. Let's say you go through GoDaddy auctions and those can take a beating, right? So, you take like an expired, I don't know, crypto project that used to be like a billion market cap. Then you run heavy affiliate articles through those. You th everything. You do like dick pills, you do supplements, you do at all at the same time. and some of them will rank and then you're trying to make all their money back in like the first couple days before it gets burned before Google catches on. Um, but yeah, to answer your question, blogs work, but if you push too hard, you're it's it's like blacklisted and you don't recover. People have to realize you don't recover. No one recovers anymore. So, it's just you got one shot. Yeah. Yeah. So, for we always talk about it on here, the like acquisition method, the monetization method, and the fulfillment method. So for like a blog, so like my mom, right? Vegan vegan blog recipe. So for acquisition side of it of a blog, you have essentially we're just using search, right? That's what the whole point of this is. It's like search traffic. The ways to monetize are are like what are the core ones? So it's display ads, display. Yep. Um ebooks, I guess. Ebooks. That's where I was going to go with it. So then it can break off into this info coaching land where like it can go upstream and like do that and that's where I'm like kind of looking like oh should I do that for my mom just as like a funny case study thing is like should I build some like 5k offer and like or community paid community something and then just build this like 100k a month business around my mom like just for sport and I think like that would be I think that would be funny but I just I think in the vegan space by the way um you should look into Facebook traffic have organic Facebook it's crazy right now. Have you have you looked into that? We have a group we have a group that has like 20,000 people in it. Yeah. So the the funnel goes like this for organic Facebook. It's if you want to pay pay money. Sure. This is what people typically do. They buy page likes. They post like super clickbaity uh posts on Facebook. Never link in the first post. It's always it's kind of like X where you have to do like oh finger down in the thread get the you know [ __ ] like that. And then people are doing not not not like crazy info numbers but like 1 to 10k per day on mediavine type numbers on display if you go viral. So you have to say some outrageous things you know in that space. Um but that that fully works still right now. Um so interesting and then you just send them over the blog and then it's all and the page likes are like percentages of cents per page like cuz no one runs those. It's like you know what I mean? Um, but make sure you just run it in high RPM places like the US, Canada, so on and so forth, and you're done. Interesting. Yeah, you'll see those ads like, oh, uh, click like if you like Jesus, or click like if you like, uh, golden retrievers. Stuff like those type of ads. And then you get fed like, oh, best, I don't know, my my dog almost died by eating this supplement. Try this instead. Stuff like that. It sends off works so well. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just You should run one of those up. It just like just were fun, you know? Yeah. I'm to the point like I was here I I remember watching all whenever I would watch stuff it was like oh and this new thing or like this oneoff crazy thing we found and all that and like I'm so much more hesitant to be like I only really want to like do something if I see legs with it and like it can scale and it's such a silly way to look at it because it's like everything starts unscalable, right? And then you can scale it or you could build a machine around like events for example like we won't host events because I'm like oh my gosh sounds like a nightmare and then you have other guys like Eman or whatever who have like event machine built around it. They have an entire ClickUp board or whatever it is or not, 500 and something tasks and when they want another one they just dup it and then they start over again and it's like they've systemized it or systematized it or whatever and it's like crazy behavior. Um, you got a pop here in a couple minutes. So, what is uh what else do you want people I mean what's hot right now? What is what's where do people find you? What is the goal um of what you're trying to build right now? Um, probably looking into software maybe do consumerf facing software. interesting using AI. I have um business partner XFang cracked. Um so we're we're gonna try to figure it figure it out. Yeah. So we'll we'll figure it out. Um something in software though. It's it's stupid easy right now. Farming up Tik Tok accounts. I've just purchased like a 100 Tik Tok accounts for US-based Tik Tok accounts for like five bucks. So I'm ready to run it. Um but yeah, shit's going to about to go crazy. I'm like cuz I'm too cheap. I'm like trying to figure out everything organic. You know what I mean? Try to game the algo and that's like my my cut of the pie. But I I'll figure it out. People can find me on X though. Indexy. Just search Jackie Chow. Um and yeah, if if people want to learn about local SEO, it's stupid easy. Your friend did it. So if I can do it, anyone can do it. Um yeah. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. No, we'll definitely have to pop on and do another one of these where we're like crazy tactical and some random thing like we we live build like I see all your stuff is so good about or just go on his YouTube too by the way because he does so many of these fun like random days where you just go so deep in a topic exactly how to do something a toz and it's like I've picked up some of those and we've used pieces of that and you sparked different things and we hired like a certain SEO guy and next thing you know we have branded XYZ content that now is number one across everything and it's like and that's yeah I get the ideas from watching your stuff so super super valuable. Appreciate it, man. Thanks for having me on, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. All right, guys. We're going to pop. We got a quick one, hour long, cuz we both got [ __ ] to do.
