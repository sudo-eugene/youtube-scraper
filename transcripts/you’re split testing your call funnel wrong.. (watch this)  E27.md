In today's video, I'm going to share how we lost millions of dollars split testing our CallFunnel the wrong way. We're going to go through an exact example and the data behind it on why this is so important specifically for CallFunnel owners. I'm going to go through the way that most people do it that is wrong. And I'm going to show you our setup that is accurately tracking and working today. If you stick around to the end, I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I make these videos every single day. So, I share real time what we are doing and where our numbers are at. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected. I make everything on this channel to show what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, this is like a real life example of one we're actively running right now. And the red here is what we're split testing, and the green are the goals. Okay? So, this is uh an example of a VSSL split test. So, people opt in and they automatically go 50/50 to lead one VSSL and lead two VSSL. All right? So, pretty simple standard test. Now green is the goals that are on page. So someone landing on the application, completing the application, landing on a booking, completing the booking, landing on the booking success page, and then terms over here is for purchasing. So this is why it's so important is because a lot of the time in call funnels, you're doing this offline conversion. It's over the phone, it's on a Zoom, and how are you tracking it back to that split? Okay, so here are just some crazy numbers that I ran this morning for this. So I took all the data of our 2024 purchases and how many of them and the time between when somebody opted in and when they actually completed purchase on average was 25.5 days and this is out of only the data of purchasers. Okay. How many between the time between application and purchase was 6 days and from the date that they actually booked the call not when they had the sales call and we have a 48 hour booking window. So from the date that they booked the call to the day they purchased on average was 3.6 days. So any of these tools you're using need to need to encapsulate and capture all the data from where they were this entire part of the funnel because 25 days later they're purchasing and you're trying to figure out when they landed on this page and which one they landed on. This is like so so critical because on page but not really. What I mean by that is yes it's tracking the user on page but you need to be able to store this server side and keep the data to know way way way way more accurately. So when someone lands on an app page in a lot of these split testing tools, it needs to be able to identify that person and know that what page they're on here to market as okay, they hit this goal, they hit this goal, they hit this goal, right? The terms and making it all the way to the end of the purchase is just like massive because they won't do anything on page. So how does it know and connect back? So V1 of this for us was Hyros. So we set up page rules in here. So basically when they landed on training-vsl1 we made a page rule that uh would basically tag them with this when they hit this URL and then anywhere else down the funnel because hyros is tracking when they do these other steps down here then we could track it back. I don't have a simple answer for you on why this did not work but this is the way we ran it for like years and every time something would happen. We ran one for like 6 months and we came uh probably longer than that and we came back and had training VSSL1 and training VSSL 2 ran them over a six-month period and they were literally down to like $1,000 difference in cash collected, right? Because the big thing here and like my business partner leans really heavy into this and I push back but like I'm on the bandwagon now. But in this VSSL, if you said, "Oh, like this one gets a 50% higher application rate than this one." You'd be like, "Oh, just mark it." because that's really easy to track. Really, really easy to track that this one got this all the way back to purchase. Little harder to track. Way longer time period. But what I'm trying to get at is if in VSSL lead one you put and the program's $1,000 and I'm going to give you a Lamborghini and this and this. And then on this one you said, "Oh, it's going to be $50,000 and it's going to be the hardest thing of your life." But the offer is the same that's pitched on the back. you are going to have more applications, more throughput of this one, but when it goes to backing out, you're going to have a lower closing percentage than somebody who has a more accurate like uh consistency throughout the funnel, right? So, it is so important that you track on opt-ins, for example, getting a 25% opt-in rate and a 20% opt-in rate that might back out into actual purchases like night and day 50% difference depending on the messaging. So, it's important that you know all of the numbers. You can make decisions based on the applications or how many bookings you get, but what you really really want to do in our opinion is that you want to make them based on what actually backs into dollars. So knowing that this one has a 30% lift in cash actually collected, not just more apps and bookings, right? And there's a time and place for all this, but this is why this is important. So we tried to do this with Hyros. It did not work. Okay. So now I'm going to show you the setup that we have that actually does work right now. VWO and HubSpot. So this is marrying those two things together to where you have the onpage data tracking. There are stats within VWO, but is mirroring the data with HubSpot and storing it in your main CRM. And you can use whatever CRM, I'm pretty sure, like they're in their integrations. So, all you're going to do in this example is you're going to set up, and I blacked all this out for sections that were like just unique and like customer information and stuff. So, the different variations in this example, you're going to drop in your main control. So, in our example, VSSL1. Then, you're going to drop in the split and you're just going to launch as a 50/50 URL split test. Okay. Now, goals inside platform, all you're going to do is track page visits on URL contains. And this is very similar to like how all the other tools work. And it just basically says when they land on this page, it's going to tag them. It's going to show that it landed on this, this, and this. You're going to have a 30% here, 10% here, 2% here, whatever. Okay. Now, what that's going to allow you to see is the different goals and their completion rates. And you're going to go here, and you can see scheduled success. And this is a real live example. I mean, today's April 8th, so I I pulled this this morning. Um, but this would show that all the way back down to the scheduled success VSSL 2 so far. So, VSSL 2, oops, all the way back to the scheduled success page has a 5.24% conversion rate, which is 10% higher than the control. Okay, all this is pretty normal in split testing. So, nothing like groundbreaking here. But for us, where it really changed is when we did the direct integration with HubSpot. And this may be like common practice for a lot of people. All I'm saying is we lost literally millions of dollars doing this the wrong way. Um then once you integrate with HubSpot Direct, it's going to push in as custom data. And I had to black some of these out. And like so right here, it's going to show you the customer name and profile when the action was completed, meaning when they hit the split test, the URL they were on that it fired, their country, region, all the stuff. And then this is the important part. So it's going to track back to the contact level the campaign they were in inside VWO the experience ID. So basically you have a campaign that has experiences inside of it and the experiences have different variations. Okay. So now what you can do is then say in charts my beautiful terribly ugly chart um there's somebody who could do this a lot better but it just gets me the data and that's what I need. You can see how many people hit the split test. So in this example, how many people landed on the VSSL? How many people then completed the application as a form submission? How many then booked a call? And then how many closed one? So I could pull these up and I I don't have this data directly, but um I could pull this up and show you the two examples of lead one versus lead two when we ran this. And these are like so so similar, right? You just saw the example of how similar these lines are. So it backs out to very very similar here. I mean, it's going to be the same here because it's how many land on it. here is going to be how many apps they got. So, this was a slight variation where two actually had I'm sorry, the control actually had more call scheduled control actually had more, but backing out the lead two had like 20% higher purchases. So, just crazy to see that like it has more calls, more apps, same amount of attempts, and has more users that backed out, right? So, just shows you how integral this is. So, you can do this at every single layer of the funnel. Um, you can do this all the way up to I gota zoom out for you. Whoops. Um, you can do this on the opt-ins. You can do this on VSSLs. You can do this on apps, booking page. Like we have one that was going for a while that was the booking page copy. So, one that was like a preframe that was way more aggressive that was like literally don't book a call unless you're serious. And then we had one that had no text on it and obviously one gets a higher completion rate than the other, but which one backs out more? In the end, one landed that had like a middlegrade copy, got more qualified people and didn't like added resistance but not too much to still get the completion. So, that was a big key for us. I hope this was helpful. Um, there's exact setups and tech and all that. I just can't share the back end of that because I will just show too much customer information and URLs and things. Um, but it's very simple setup. I'm super pissed that it took me so long to do this and get this set up in a correct way. Um, we did try it with Hyros. don't have an exact reason on why this didn't work because you'd think it would if there was a tag that fired for that exact uh person because it has all their fingerprints. It has all the stuff that they've done throughout over time. So just being able to look and say who has training VSSL tag one across this range and what it really came down to was that whole like across ranges. So if you're doing it across this range, there's cash that's collected that's like at a later date. There's cash that or like leads that haven't been realized. Like it's really weird like how they do the attribution of the timing. Um, we went crazy custom with this and got this built because we thought it was a URL tagging issue. So, we did an on page firing custom events and like everything all the way down to just like not working in the end and this was like nine clicks. Um, another quick little thing on this uh super technical or not super but very technical is we have we customized the script on this because essentially you need the VWO script to load the page and choose what split test so which VSSL they're going to go to. Then you need the HubSpot like script to run so it can identify what the person's information is and basically have that to match with the customer profile. And then you need the VWO thing to like fully load to send that information. Right? So VWO to do the transfer or to pick the split. Then you need the HubSpot uh to load to get the like HubSpot UTK and tracking and then you need to push that over through V back to VWO. So then it can push all of that together over to HubSpot to match because it's super important like in this column that I don't have here that it's showing the profiles because if it's not connecting to a profile, there's no data being stored. Like it's it's logging into here, but it's not showing or connecting to an actual profile. So it's not going to be helpful for you to see which person did what. Um I don't know if I shared this ever, but I have a sticky note on here that's like every one is someone and I always look at that, which is like all these are one specific person, and I have to like remind myself that sometimes. Um but you have to look at it in that way to understand sometimes on these splits like at volume it's just numbers. Um but like each individual one when you're doing these splits and the data behind it is all the way back to one person. So blah blah blah but yesterday's stats let's get into it. 632 leads 200 apps 85 calls booked not on day seven high ticket buyers. So, I don't know if you watched yesterday's, but uh not we have been in a not good position where we've been closing like one or two or three a day, which is like terrible for us. So, seven is a getting closer and back on track, but still not necessarily where we want to be. 32 32 low to get buyers. We decided to chop down some of the spend on that to get it back to kind of like just a baseline amount until we know that the numbers back out. Our target for this is anywhere from 3.5 to 4% ascension rate. But when you're ramping so many new low tickets, it is or so many new uh purchasers. We don't know the timeline uh of what it's going to take to cash close. So like I said on this, we don't have Whoops. We don't have these stats in like a clean way where we know how long it takes them to go from low ticket purchase to uh setter call or closer call to purchase uh of the backend program. We don't have that yet. So, I'm just waiting to track on that. But yesterday, 32 of those and then 51k in cash collected versus the day before. I'm showing exact streamshots cuz I don't care. And you can look at yesterday's and I had this one on here yesterday. So, yeah, that's what I got. So, Instagram for communication. Comment below, feed the algo, share it. I don't know what to do, but I make these videos every day. Let me know what you want more videos on. Tuxen.
