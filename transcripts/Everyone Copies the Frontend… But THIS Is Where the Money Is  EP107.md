What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about info coaching businesses that have massive back-end monetization models. We're going to walk through a couple examples of how we usually get customers and what they usually buy in info coaching, but then some weird back-end monetization models that I've seen in the financial space using masterminds, sports, and then how we are doing it with our version. And sorry if you hear some crazy stuff in the audio, in the background. I'm at a bachelor party, but we still need to do our daily video. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 75 million in total cash collected and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool So, let's get into it. Uh to start on info coaching, so these are the main core ones. I I split it up with the red and blue here on organic versus paid, but essentially for an organic, this is very very classic for info coaching. You're going to have organic traffic source, your normal whatever 100k followers on XYZ. you're going to push them a lot of the time to a direct to cart info product. So, it's going to be something that has little to no fulfillment uh costs or needs. It's going to be a pre-recorded course, community, all of that. And it's going to be under $2,000. So, people can purchase it direct on direct to cart. And then what a lot of people will do for their backend for the monetization will do high ticket. So, they'll sell some sort of u basically usually just implementation that's further on this. So, instead of doing something that is done, you know, as is just like out of the course where you just do it yourself, the implementation goes up higher and that's done through high ticket. So, it's done with you, it's done for you in some capacity. Okay, so this is where most people like stop the gambit. Um, I am going to talk a little bit on here on the mastermind one um as an example. A lot of people then also will just go straight to high ticket. It needs a sales team um generally speaking because it's an over over 2K. Um you can technically kind of mix these and like have direct to cart that is high ticket but it's a little scarcer. And then we're just going to say same thing with paid which is a little more difficult um but very very consistent and scalable. So we're just going to get straight into this on here on info coaching direct that has these. So the ones that I've seen directly are ones in the financial space. So people always ask me what all the time like what would I start, what would I start? And again, sorry about the audio. We have people running around all around me right now. But um so financial wise, let's use these as an example. So insurance is the one I talk about all the time because I saw it. I actually ran a VSSL funnel that was similar, you know, to this. So essentially it was running um paid ads. We actually did some cold outreach at the same time, which is kind of crazy. It's the only time I've ever done cold outreach. Um but it was a specific niche and we were helping them solve for taxes and retirement. So, basically, how to pay no taxes in retirement, which was uh using whole life insurance. So, we modeled this whole thing around, built this whole VSSL uh funnel, opt-in funnel. So, name, email, phone number, opt, they go, they watch a VSSL, they apply, book a call. Um the big issue with these a lot of the time is the consumption and the warmth. But once you crack it and once you can get them in to either buy something low ticket, because if you're trying to go direct and just like have them put $3 million in a whole life policy and they've seen, you know, a 12minute video of you and then applied to talk to you, like it's just not going to work. So, I just had a video with Jeremy uh Haynes and he talks about this a lot is the consumption, the consumption, the consumption, getting ahead of, you know, all the objections before they become um or obstacles or whatever before they become uh uh objections in the sales call. Um but yeah, so they need the trust and the awareness with you. So, insurance a very very good example of this of who has done this. Um I don't want to say exact names. I think I've said them before on accident, but essentially they ran a uh paid directtoart funnel. So, they were running uh paid advertising to a funnel that was how to become financially free in 10 years or less, I'm pretty sure was the framing of it. They watched this big VSSL or it was actually a webinar and then pushed them direct to cart to either a$1 or $2,000 product. Once they got into there, there was a higher rung, but what they did is they leveraged monetization method one, which where they then talked about this vault. Use the vault, use the vault, and it was actually whole life insurance. Okay? So, then everyone's getting whole life insurance, which these guys are then them or partners or whatever are licensed to sell whole life insurance. So they make these huge commissions on this and then you know in insurance it can be whatever 10 years of commissions or something. Um they stack on top of each other. Then from there they were then telling them how to because the whole thing was around how to essentially become financially free by having passive income that overtakes your uh expenses, right? So basically doing it through rentals. So they taught people how to use this vault to do this real estate portion. So everyone got this then they taught them how to do real estate and then in the real estate thing they also had like I think it was a fund on that end or like fix and flips and all this. So they're making monetization there and then one of them I think was a fund. So I think there was three on the back of this. But it was massive. Like you can do so much size with these especially just this portion like uh for example the um the insurance portion. Another one of someone I've seen do this. I'm just going to stay in this financial one um is the taxation one. So there are guys that were at um Onyx Singal's mastermind that do a taxation program. Theirs is very funny because they'll run paid and it's uh theirs is paid direct to high ticket and in their high ticket uh it's basically like yeah no financing no whatever if you have to use financing to pay for this like you are not somebody who qualifies for this and just not going to work. Um so they sell direct there and then they have monetization 1 2 3 4 that are essentially these different like partnerships that they have. So once you get people that are in the rung, the big thing here that I'm trying to get to is that it's the person like who else has your same customer. So if you have who else has your same customer and you're not building like enterprise value on this like these partnerships that you can make are massive. So somebody who comes in and then has your exact 60 to 65 whatever or let's say 40 40 to 60 year old um high net worth individual. They also need an estate attorney. They also need you know XYZ. they also get trusts or whatever, you know, I mean, like they do all these different pieces. They need a CPA, they need a whatever. Like, so you can then refer these out for large sums of money depending on like who the who the actual client demo is. All to say back in the beginning who your target of info coaching is is like the biggest biggest thing here. So, if you can do it for wealthy individuals, if you can do it for individuals that grow into XYZ spot and then have large businesses, uh if you can do it in basically any capacity to where they then have the opportunity or already are like wealthy individuals, um and we're going to get to that down here with the sports example of like somebody who has the um capacity or the um the ability to get to the point of making large large sums of money. So, yeah, any XYZ large business thing. Another really good example of this is there's a guy who does insurance specifically for like snow for example. So it's like all the snow guys know each other. All the landscape guys, whatever these like massive shows, but if there's the guy that becomes that, he can do these like mid tickets or high tickets that are, you know, come in here, learn how I grow XYZ, but then also monetization methods because everyone needs insurance, everybody needs, you know, payroll, whatever, you know, all these different examples where they then use partnerships to like null them out. So that's an example in the financial one. I would definitely do it in this insurance space. If I was to do it again, like I literally the people I met were like, "Oh, you can do this with annuities and hundreds of calls. You can do this and this." So that's one. Mastermind is the classic one, but I want to explain how it can like the math behind it and how it can absolutely crush. So if you have what a lot of these guys will do is like paid, direct to cart, high ticket. Um like the an example I can use is like whole Gordon's like his crushes. Um but so they uh will have this normal info coaching ladder and he actually has this uh interesting two two place two-sided marketplace, right? So like they'll have paid direct to cart. They'll teach someone how to be a sales rep. They'll then have well there's kind of like multiple offers. His may be a bad example because his is like really intricate and like cool and very cool how it's set up. Um but so if it's let's use who's a good example like Russell Brunson for example. He has uh a ton of these that are like these massive ladders up that go from here until you're in this high ticket program and then they have essentially like an inner circle layer one. They have an inner circle layer two three four all the way up that can tear up. And when you're doing this, you're like what a lot of the time it's sold as is like you're climbing this top tier and wrong. You're making more money along the entire way and you're learning new skills that become there. So the framing was always like category king. So everyone at this phase learns how to do xyz. They all stay consistent with you know basically let's say it's teaching you how to get clients. Okay, everyone gets from getting how to get clients here. This next layer of it of the coaching and the massive backend. You've already paid to acquire them as a customer. You've already paid your sales rep. ever the natural next step for them is to then learn how to productize a service or for example then the next layer is how to be like the category king for your thing. So, it's like all these people are all kind of, you know, overlapping niches um or are, you know, there's a few of them and then one or two will rise to the top and be the guy for, you know, acquisition of leads in the landscaping space or the guy for life insurance, uh, high ticket or, you know, I mean, like all these different models and then they go into here and how the math works on those is nuts on the mastermind level on the back end because you'll have a hundred people in at whatever 70 grand. It's like $7 million and let's say you have a 50% margin on it because there's some crazy cost to fulfill. You basically give them the offerings up on your way here or piece and part them for whatever the specific person needs. But the monetization on it is so large. I mean like if it's 50% it's $3.5 million added in profit that again you're just not going to get in the same it's going to take a lot more work uh after. So this is like what it's where you can get this all comes down to like LTV to CAC ratios and like how big you can get the LTV. But if you can build a model like this and always start over here just like you have to hammer this and make sure this is great to then you know reap this and get more uh juice out of it over here. But yeah, it's a really really big one. So masterminds are a big one. Um an example like that doesn't work for us. So like these for example don't work for us because our customer base is kind of more broad to where it's like what is the next layer of mastermind? What is the next and I'll get into what our version is um but what is that for there? I know other people who do like specific income qualifications for um XYZ service and then it kind of does boat itself to have mastermind or higher tier because it's like oh then you're going to hang out with other people who are crushing it that are all very very similar to me. Like that's the thing is if you have this like broad like if you're an agency and you have nine different niches um it doesn't make sense to like you know put them all in the same room. If you're uh you know teaching how to do sales reps for uh for final expense insurance and you build this up it does make sense to have all the top guys like they all want to hang out. They want to learn from each other. Oh, you're crushing it. You're crushing it. Same way that conferences work. Same way that all that kind of stuff is like you want to hang out around people that are doing the same. So, the little things you find the one three 5% at that scale are like hundred tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars uh if not millions of dollars when they add up. So, that's one. This is a really unique one um that I actually heard about relatively recent. So, let's use an example of um soccer. So, let's use like soccer or football or whatever you want to call it. Um but say you have uh training for goalies. Okay? Okay, so you're teaching people how to be like the best goalie ever. So you can have paid ads or let's say you have this big organic following and you want to launch this. You have some sort of uh direct to cart that's some 2K product that teaches them how to do XYZ or how to I don't I don't even know probably bad example but like how to stop 80% of goals that come at you or how to um deny every single, you know, penalty kick or whatever it is. So you teach them how to do this and what you're really teaching them in in this to do is you have different tiers. So you have like the high school kids, you have the college, you have the like pro or whatever and they all have different results, but you're helping them get to the next tranches or like become allstars or become whatever. So you can sell direct to cart things to them and then pretty easily then upsell into a high ticket or you can even go direct to high ticket. So something that's five grand a year, 20 grand a year or whatever to help them do it and then you're matching that to what the ICP is. So whether that's high school, college or whatever, then you can match it to that. Okay. And where this gets crazy is you have like so you have those different tiers that you can service and generally speaking like pretty solid business model and I know exa I know people who do this. I don't want to like dox exactly what their setup is but like are crushing with this model in sports for like a specific position. So like again let's use soccer soccer goalie as the one. But the next trunch of this is this agency style model. And I've heard of people doing this before. So like someone just said this to me the other day and I was like oh yeah it makes a lot of sense cuz like I've literally seen it play out. I've seen it happen in entertainment world. I've seen it happen um one other time in the sports world, but essentially once you have this book, it's like who else who else wants my customer? Who else has my customer? Who else wants your customer is like the professional leagues. Who else wants your customer is like the main large entertainment p like district and like think about how the agencies and the agents work inside the entertainment industry or the sports industry. They get these percentages of like the tens of million dollar contracts and you know maybe those are the larger ones. I'm not fantastic with sports. I don't know why I use an example. Like using that framework, you then go from here from making, you know, a,000 bucks per to your LTV being in the high thousands, tens of thousands to the blended average when you have 10% of them that then go into the pros and you get, you know, x percentage of 2 million or 5 million or 20 million or whatever on these contracts and all the other inflow that then you get because everyone knows about you here. So it comes back and it exists as organic referral slash whatever like this beast just like feeds itself. So, that is a huge one. The agency portion of it um that I've heard of that can like really crush all of this. I'm gonna go into our version now and then we'll cut it because I got to go because everyone's being loud and rowdy. Um but the other one um is basically just the idea of having something that has a massive monetization portion where somebody can either make a bunch of money and you can get a percentage where there are a lot of uh similar people that you can charge basically have in the same room where there are financial products or something that is very large high ticket. So again, same thing like getting a percentage of a larger deal. I've heard people do this in real estate that have crushed it because they get portions of funds. I've heard people do this in buy sell businesses that have done it and gotten on there. Um Roland Fraser talks about about like consulting for equity. Like essentially you can offer service that you already have for equity, which is like, you know, kind of same thing as consulting. At a certain point, if you have the right person who is buying your product, same idea that if you sell low ticket and you sell 10,000 of them, but it's like not in congruency with your high ticket, then it won't ascend. It's the very it's the same It's like if you have to sell to somebody that can either become or already is somebody who has this influence, this wealth, this whatever and then can take them it can go to the next trunch. Okay. So like what our version of this in women's fitness. So for us thus far we've always just done this. So we have done or this one I'm sorry. So we've run paid ads to high ticket. So we have this large um large onetoone coaching program um that's annual. We then actually just sell the same thing on the back end. So we'll just do like recurring. So it's a renewal for this. What we just rolled out was monetization one is what I'm calling it for like another back end. So it's a low ticket. It's um I'm sorry it's not low ticket it's a downell continuity. So it's around half the price and they can stay with uh group coaching instead of one to one. So fulfillment for us is extremely easy. And then a lot of people still want that because it's like oh I don't need the one to one touch point. I don't want to pay that cost for year two or three or whatever. Um I already got what I needed for the personalization excuse me but they need the other portion. So or they need they want to stay in there. or they want access to the app community, whatever. So that's like monetization one. The next one we're layering in is supplements. So people already do this. All of them already take supplements. It's like why aren't we getting our piece? So for normally what I would say is just doing this with partnerships. So a lot of people will do this with partnerships, but for us we're trying to build like equity value and make it so this thing is like in-house, not just oh we have a contract with so and so where we get 40%. So monetization 2 then becomes that it becomes um in-house version of like supplements or like hormones or peptides or GLPs or stuff like that. Like we don't prescribe to certain pieces of that. So that's just an example um because it's not part of our methodology. But what do they already buy or who else has our ideal customer profile, right, that we can use in it and leverage in this. And then that next piece I did put on here is data and partnerships because there's so much in our pocket of what we're doing that other people want this customer. So a very very stupid and simple example is like Medicare for example like um people use that uh as monetization methods where it's oh we have all this data and there's always rules around like you know what you can sell for data or what you can make intros on or what you're not actually like what you can or can't do. Um I'm not going to touch on that because that's not our game. Uh and right now we just play this game uh this right here. So into the next phases we're going to see what we can do in regards to that and data and all those pieces. So hopefully this was helpful. Um today's kind of shot out of a Canon one. I can do a Q&A tomorrow. So, if you guys want to submit a Q&A, that is going to be this right here. Q&A, uh, submit to the request box, uh, I'll make an expost about this as well. If you go to the doc right here, you'll see all of the past videos. You can break down by tech, ops, marketing, sales, all the things. Info coaching, this one right here is a survey that I'm doing to try and get gather just a bunch of data and see what people in the info coaching space, what they're doing for offers, what they're doing for pricing, how big their teams are, how they're kind of like leaning. There's an info like if you want to fill out your contact info on the end if you want me to contact you. Maybe I can help. I'm not char I'm not like doing anything for cash or whatever. So, just FYI, just using it to collect data. I maybe will eventually, but like not really in the cards right now and I won't sell anything. Um, and then Rolodex. This is all my people that I directly have worked with um or have known for x amount of time and have actually really good results. So, if you guys want anything like sales agencies or CRM or you know, W, you know, financing, stuff like that, I have some pretty cool deals with a lot of these guys. Um, but don't feel I mean, you can just find all these direct on your own. You don't have to do this and I just have some good ones. So, yeah, that's where we're at. Sorry for the shot of a can video today. People are yelling and screaming out here and being rowdy. And, uh, I got to go. So, I appreciate you guys. Uh, hopefully you did get some value from this. Hopefully, it helped you think a little bit. Uh, we were literally talking about this at dinner last night. It was my fault. So, my bad there to everybody who's trying to have a fun bachelor party and I'm trying to talk about monetization methods. So, classic. But, I'll talk to you guys soon. Um and yeah.
