# $75M Q&A: Offers, Funnels, Hiring, Cold Traffic | EP79
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ilqvdFtQw

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to have some fun and go through our weekly weekend Q&A round five. All these questions were submitted to the request box over the last week, and today we're going to deep dive every single one of them. We have everything from how to find partners to how do you get [ __ ] done, scaling offers with limited money, some of the best courses for paper call, acquiring talent, mindset, all of the things. We have a lot of context and a lot of in-depth questions today. So, I think this is going to be very tactical and helpful. I promise you that you are going to learn something or come up with some idea from some a question someone has asked. So stick around to the end and check it out. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now as of today crossed over 75 million. I can finally get that last disc in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No courses, no mentorship, no consulting. I don't want your money. Everything on the channel is just showing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing right now to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company opportunities and building a network of cool people building cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. It is Friday at 8 PM, so we're kicking off the weekend strong. Let's go. You start from scratch today. No money, just experience. How would you pitch your service building a full infrastructure around someone's brand to potential partners in an email? Thank you. Um, so what it sounds like you're trying to do is basically do the like um publishing style. So you're going to come in and take an expert and build a business around them. So you're going to try and pitch them via email. I've never done any cold outreach, so I'm not your person for that part. Sorry. Um I'm not going to pretend like I am. So there are tons of people. Let's go through this instead actually. So the way that I would go approach this is how I approach all these other things is find somebody who has what you want or has done this and uses this process and model it off of them. Okay? So you're going to find someone on YouTube, you're going to find a course, you're going to find a Facebook community, you're going to find something that you can join and see how people are doing this cold outreach model if that's how you're trying to do that. Um the other piece of this is if you just have no no money and no experience, you either need to kind of go about it two approaches. If you have no experience, you have no case studies. So you're kind of selling error and you're selling the dream of some result. If you have the confidence to do so and you want to be the person who kind of like fix it till you make it selling, which is not necessarily a problem at all. Um you just go at it. You just, you know, do volume. You find somebody who will do that. The other option is to do it more so on the trust basis, which is, you know, approaching this kind of candidly. I haven't done this. I've seen other people do this. This is how the model does work. This that's how I started. Uh this is how the model does work and I want to try it and I want to build this around you. You know, give me 90 days to get XYZ results. The other thing is when you're pitching your service, uh how you're pricing it. So, you want to make the offer good. You want to, you know, in the beginning if you don't have case studies and you don't really have the confidence around it, it's kind of hard in my opinion to sell something that's 10 grand or 50 grand or some whatever. But if you want to take a percentage, if you want to do performance based, if you want to do it for free to get a couple case studies or do it free plus performance, right, is like generally how I've how I've always done things is if you get the performance, you get paid. Um, so there's some trust factor in that and then yeah, you can just come to it very candidly. That is like, you know, I've never done this and I want your trust basically. Um, and there are people that will land with that are probably more in alignment with you. Um, or you can swing for the fences, but it is very, very doable. Um, Josh Gavin has a course on this. I think what you're talking about is building a business around someone's brand, like an expert. Um, that's all they do. Offer publishing is what they're calling it. So, you basically find an expert and build that business. So, hopefully that's helpful. How to find partners. Um, I assume you mean business partners. Uh, but for partners, I kind of look at it. Let's do this. I look at it look at them in three kind of buckets. You have like people who are ahead of you or like mentor style people. You have people who are in the trenches that are kind of at the same level as you. And then you have other people that are at, you know, behind you a little bit. And I don't mean that in a negative way just like you have more experience in business or whatever you know industry or financially or life in general and those people. So you have those three buckets when finding the top ones mentors you either are paying for them or you are in the right rooms and they see value in you and you can bring something to the table that they don't have or they see some grit in you. They see something. um finding them just overall is being in the right rooms, getting the right network, um providing value in the right way that you get noticed for those people in the trenches. That's kind of a lot easier. That's the majority of them. That's how most businesses that have partners are started, right? It's like two people that want to do something together. They have a shared vision. They have a shared experience currently and ideally they have different skill sets that complement each other. So there's not too much overlap because there's a lot of pain there. Um and then the last one, so that one's like the easiest to do. I found business partners inside course communities. I've made friends inside course communities. I've made friends in free communities and on X and wherever else, right? So like just people that are in the same situation that have the same desired goal is someone who could identify as a partner. Uh again, I think it's important that you have differentiating skill sets or ones that complement each other. And then the last piece of that with uh is someone who is you know basically wants to come like mentor mentee under you and that's way easier but you need you know the experience the clout the whatever you want to call it. Um, and not to like toot my own horn or anything, but like now with like a small audience I've built, I'm sure I could post and find media buyer that would want to be a partner for X% for example or something else like that. Like I have Martekch guys that want to do that. So I hope that's helpful. Um, you can look a lot of places to actually find them, but internet's a great place. I've met my business partners online to start. Um, all of them that I've ever worked with actually. Um, and yeah, I think it's a great model. Would love to hear your would love to hear about your iteration process. AB testing process. How you test new VSSL, new leads, new LPS, optin pages, especially now with AI, we can pop up dozens of new leads for our VSSL if we want to. Dozens of new ads, dozens of everything, but how the heck do we allocate budget to that many new assets? You define, you don't just throw everything at the wall. You do kind of for sure, but like you don't you find the ones that are actually you think are the best that you have a thesis that are that is that these are going to be the best. You you know write out why you think they are and you give them an adequate amount of time to test. So, let's start from the top. VSSLs. If you're running a, let's make this simple. If you're running a DTA funnel, so you're running direct to application and you have a headline, a VSSL, and a button, you keep everything isolated and completely the same. Yes, you're going to have different ads that are all running to them, but that is part of the that that's a that's a consistent constant of that. Um, you can route singular ads to singular ones, but then you mess with your, you know, variations in your splits. So, you're going to run one campaign to multiple pages that are splitting. Other people will run the same dupe an entire campaign and run it to two different URLs. We don't do that now. Uh we just do, you know, we use VWO for ours. They will land on the page and you'll split the traffic. If you have a control, you're generally speaking going to keep it call it 80% of the traffic and only split 20% because you don't want to screw with it if the other one tanks. Um so a lot of the time you'll do splits that are actually much less in terms of that. Um but a normal is 50/50 if you don't know off the rip and you're testing. You're going to test your new VSSLs. And for us, depending on what your goal is, if you're testing VSSL that goes direct to cart, if you're testing VSSL that is to book a call funnel, whatever, you're going to have everything that happens after the fact. So, let's use a VSSL call funnel. You are going to have a you're going to have an application, you're going to have a booked call, and then you're going to have a purchase. Now, the most important thing there is a purchase, and you need to be able to tie that back. And that's like the most important part because even if the other VSSL gets 50 times more calls but only gets two sales and the other one gets 10 calls and gets five sales, that one's the winner, right? Depends on what you're optimizing for, for sure. But like, let's be real, the the goal here is to get a low cost per purchase. And none of the other metrics matter in the end. Um, except for how they divide out and get to there. So, you're going to want to crown winners on that. For new leads, same thing. You're going to have your VSSL that wins and then your full VSSL that wins. And then you're going to then roll into leads. And you're going to test this variable at a time. You're not going to run this nine wide unless you're spending tens of thousands of dollars a day over x amount of time. And you know your time from lead to purchase because you need to let it run through. Okay. Opt-in pages very similar. Um in my opinion, we you also will test those uh to purchase. You can have an opt-in page that claims the world and another one that is more realistic. The more realistic one gets a lower opt-in rate. The hyper crazy whatever promise one gets all the optin rate in the world. And one maybe it's not compliant. And two, even if that gets higher opt-in rate, it does not necessarily mean that you get more applications, bookings, and call and uh purchases, you need to do what is your revenue per lead essentially on that and understand where that comes from. So that is some backend tracking for sure, especially when there's time to lead. You can't just use a tool out of the box that's just, you know, based on page clicks. I'm sure there are is one, but it's just cleaner to store in your own CRM. Dozens of everything. How do we allocate budget into that? So yeah, I would isolate those. is you bring the winners into one bucket and when you're doing splits once you have a control you slow split you split where they are a lesser percentage. So hopefully that was helpful. I didn't mean to burst a bubble at all but yeah there's a lot of other metrics that go into that and it's really important that you know your from split to conversion the time between that because you need to be able to run it for that time for everyone that you run through and test. Uh one of the OGs used to say that it was 50 that would have conversions to know which one's a winner. I think it's higher. I think it's, you know, hundred and something, but that's based on the person, that's based on the budget, that's based on the comfort level, the scale, all the things. So, hopefully that was helpful. Um, feel free to ask another one if that didn't answer. Are you current currently running any high ticket funnels that convert from paid ads without a closer? I'm trying to sell two products, 47 this. How would you approach this without a closer? Yeah, we do not. We've never done this. Uh we like OG gogg did the $497 option which we then took to a call funnel which was crazy behavior cuz $497 over the phone is like way too low generally cuz imagine you're getting a $100 call and then 50% of them show up so you have a $200 call uh or live call and then you close whatever one in four of those. So that's what $800 and you you made $500 before fulfillment. Like the math doesn't work. Um so these you can do direct to cart. A lot of people do VSSL to direct to cart. They do webinar direct to cart. Um, yeah. I mean, I know a lot of people that do a th000 to $2,000 products direct to cart. So, it's just figuring out which funnel type is going to work best for you. Live webinar, pre-recorded webinar, VSSL, and then just having good messaging copy and all that kind of stuff around there. Generally, this does need that type of sales process. It's not where you just send them to a lander and they check out. That's usually for a lower ticket thing. Um, so yeah, that's how I'd approach it. There's, you know, Alen Sultanic has a bunch of stuff in his Nothing Held Back. There's also the model where these are the back end of a funnel. So you sell something that's like, you know, $27 that then ascends them up to these, whether these are direct cart inside the funnel, like inside the upsells as Otto's or this is on the back end, you know, once they're in the program, they can click to buy an upgrade or they book a call and then you sell it through that. So yeah, that's how I do it without a closer. I do like the closer game. I think there's more room for error. I think you can scale it up um a little bit easier and then do this part after. But that's my personal opinion. So this definitely works. I can promise you that. Like there I've podcast the interviews. Brooke Hittink was talking about how he does one right now that's like $9.97 up to $19.97 um like $2,000 and he's cranking on that right now and it's a VSSL to direct to cart or a webinar direct to cart. I've nailed creative and sales copy. Let's go though. I've only ever deployed in an organic context. 800 million views generated on complicated top topics. Nice. I'm going to pivot into paid ads next month. Why? And have the capacity to create 28 pieces of new video each week for testing. That's plenty. My offer and funnel are dial. I've been told by ad spenders around the world. Me doing a moderate spend 10,000s a month that creative is most out of the battle when it comes to meta ads. True. Assuming your offer and funnel is dialed. Would you agree with this or is targeting equally difficult to master? No, I would not. Uh yes, I would agree. I would I do not think it's difficult. for context have generated over $700,000 organically though only at around a 40% margin against that's an this is the most interesting part of this on how you're only doing 40% profit margins and you're doing everything organic maybe you have like a big marketing budget of like creating the organic content and that's what that is um but yeah you got to be careful with that because if you're not in you know high multiples of rorowaz you know the 5x or the whatever do the quick math just for your new revenue if you're doing new rorowaz and you spend $1 and you make back two then you only have50 50% margin, right? Is you know, I mean, it's kind of different, but we're just going to use this as an example. Then you're burning cash. You're out of money because that math doesn't work. So, that's why a lot of time you'll hear like these organic guys talk about having like 60 to 80% margin and then the guys who do it on paid are like 30 to 40%. Um, because that 30% or whatever, they'll get eaten by cash or uh eaten by ad spend. So, they'll spend a million bucks to make three or four million bucks, which is, you know, 25 to 33% of their thing month over month. But that's also why backends exist and why big bigger businesses have backends. Acquisition is high. That's fine. Whoever can, you know, pay to the most to acquire customer wins type energy. Um, so yeah, it's kind of a deeper question there. One, I don't really know why you're going to paid ads. I mean, there's an easy land grab for like retarget and stuff, but to crack cold is a little bit different. And if you're already doing this, like it sounds like it's working. Um, but 800 million views to 700K is really I don't know the exact math, but that doesn't sound good. Um, so I don't know if these are not conversion focused or if your mechanism for conversion isn't working or if the back end isn't there, but I would probably need some more context on this and it's just my opinion. We don't we don't nail organics, so I don't have the numbers for you. Almost like 1% of our attribution is firstclick organic. Everything's paid. So I don't have a ton so not going to pretend like I have the perfect answer for you, but ask another one maybe. But that was that was a good one. How do you get [ __ ] done? I [ __ ] I [ __ ] it up. I don't get [ __ ] done. I do, you know, sit at this desk for 16 hours and I could probably do the work in eight if I was focused. I bounce around like crazy. Um I've had periods of like fantastic of this. My best system is I just, you know, naturally I'm fired up and I'm up at 4 in the morning and I come to this desk and I work from 4:00 to 7:00 or 8 when I'm building stuff and that's like my nobody [ __ ] with me time and then I roll into meetings and just back and forth. But I am a XYZ of I it's like the dopamine of I check an email and then check a text and then pop on X and then I have nine Slack messages and then I'm on a random meeting and then I'm on this or I pull a report and like I'm terrible at this. So this is actually something I'm actively getting better at doing and working on. Um but how I would get [ __ ] done, it's leverage, right? So it's like you have your time and then you have other people's time and you have code and you have media and you have all the things. But like the ne the first layer is just optimizing yourself. That's why everyone talks about like the morning routines and the you know time blocking and structuring and doing high leverage activities you know the next being like labor and having team that can do it because it's you know you working through team so now you have four people under you have four times the amount of production in terms of hours right and then you have a players and they are better at you than something and they can do it better then has a cost to it so there's a whole game here but yeah optimize you first and get that I'm constantly working on that I'm not perfect in theing slightest um and yeah so work on you work on having an A team, work on having things that work without you, AI, automations, um, you know, whatever type of code, work on things that are evergreen, like brand and content, work on things like that. So, or make a bunch of money and have your money work for you. It's kind of the leverage model, the four C's or whatever they call it. I've heard you say if you started from scratch, you'd find the expert and build the systems around them. I do bisop work for a growing influencer in the niche luxury space with 25,000 followers and deep expertise in high ticket product world, fashion. Okay. I'm planning to start with a low ticket front-end guide to build trust and then ascend into medium ticket with other offlers similar to what you mentioned on your videos. What would be a playbook to get from zero to 10K with a low in mind? Okay, wait. So, let's let me understand this. I do bisop work bisop for a growing influencer in the niche luxury space with 25,000 followers and deep expertise in high ticket product world. Don't sell them low ticket. They are high ticket people. You sell one person and make 10 grand. I I don't think I don't know if I'm fully understanding this, but if like there's no harm in we just now started selling something that's low ticket for economics and scale and brand awareness and stuff, but we've been selling things that are high ticket, which aren't even this high ticket. Um like high ticket product world, like fashion in a long like ever. Um that's like the honeypot. Um Dan Kennedy has a book on this. It's like selling to the affluent. Go read that. Um but that is like a life hack. An absolute life hack. And you see the meme that's like, you know, someone with a 5k invoice that's like follows up 19 times and when's work going to get done and then someone else that's 50k wire that's like, you know, I wire sent, let me know. And it's like kind of that energy. But if you're selling to a niche that is high ticket product world, you don't need to then sell them something low ticket or they view it as cheap. You need to match the market. Um, am I maybe I don't know that if I fully understand this, but you need to match the market on that. And if you wanted to do this, yeah, something that's community based, something that's it's just low ticket is just value. So, you need to give them something valuable enough that frames them in the way that it makes sense to have ascend into a high ticket offering. But if you just have a high ticket offering, I don't know what this is, but I you can just go straight to that with a callunnel very easily if there's a good offer and the market's there. Hey Ryan, I've taken your advice and invested into mentorship. Oh man. Um, for context, we build pre-all systems that increase close rates and shorten sales cycle. Send it my way, brother. Um, and I say brother and guy because 3% or it's like 2.2% of my audience is female on every platform. So, hate to see it, but seems that's what our industry is. So, we're going to keep saying guys. Here's the thing. I don't really want to take this offer into the info agency space despite having been a closer and using these systems myself for the past three years. That's fine. The life hack is using all this digital marketing stuff outside of the space in landscaping, in software, in whatever. I mean, like software is probably a bad example, but like some of these other ones, like any other industry that you then layer digital marketing in versus selling to other digital marketers and info and coaching to info and coaching people is like such a life hack. Um, yeah, despite having many clients in this niche already because you have networks, of course, uh, it's just so saturated. I don't have the mental mental energy to talk on camera all day. I don't get why you'd have to talk on camera all day for this, but not another one. More of a systems guy. Would rather pay someone for outreach and just take sales calls. That being said, I want to target highle B2B companies with an abundance of call demo. Agreed. 100% agreed. Since you're savvy with marketing, you probably understand my offer very well. Happy to dive into mechanism another time. I'd love to hear how you go about landing some meetings by providing value to high level guys who aren't binging YouTube. Also, how would you position my offer to cold traffic? Um, I don't really understand that. I'd love to hear how you would go about landing some meetings by providing high value to to providing value to highle guys who aren't binging YouTube and how you'd position my offer to cold traffic. First off, a lot of highle people binge YouTube. Let's be very clear. It's the whole market's here. Um, just depends on what part of the of YouTube and the internet you live on. There are guys that'll sit here and have four hour videos on taxation that you can sit and that are worth $10 million and watch YouTube videos with their bourbon at 12 PM or at, you know, whatever [ __ ] time. So, I don't think that that's really what it is. But, I mean, you'd position your offer the same way you position any offer. What's the likelihood to get the result? How good, you know, does it solve their problem? Like, you know, go read Alex Hormosy's offers book and you'd position your offer in that way. And then, yes, niche down and target one of these industries is not info coaching. If you don't want to work with info agency coaching space, go work in go help Dennis get better show rates for appointments. go help whatever business model that uses call funnels like exclusively like software demos for example like um you know Oracle some of the big like accounting agencies that do demos like just stuff like that I mean you're going to know your ICP better than I am but go and niche on that target and then live in their land and own that thing and then yeah make an offer go read Alexi's book he's going to tell you how to do this 50 times better than I am on how to position the offer but it's essentially like the value equation he has so make an offer that's so feels like you people feel stupid saying no to type vibe and go do that. So hopefully that's helpful. How to scale an offer with limited money. You don't need any money to scale an offer um with depends on the acquisition source. You can do it for through organic. You can do it through affiliates and partnerships. There's a guy that I know that does over 100 million a year and it's just partnerships. They've never run an ad, never done any organic marketing, nothing. They just have like, you know, a brand name and that they have referrals through affiliates. So you don't need money at all. You just need to do service delivery and then you pay them a CPA. So, partnerships, stuff like that. The other option is like we started ours with, you know, a couple thousand dollars in a bank account. Um, like literally like $2,000 and then you just bootstrap. You sell a bunch of people, you know, organic audience, cold reach out or cold outreach. You sell people and then you use the cash to reinvest and you just build and know that you don't take money out for a little bit until you scale up to a size that it's making money that is, you know, free cash that that's actually profit, not just, you know, next month's rent. Um, and then yeah, you go from there. So, a lot again, a lot of this stuff on this, a lot of build a business. Start with something that's service work. So, it's your time that you're spending instead of having to pay people um or a hard cost like you know, I keep saying landscaping, but selling something that's a backyard that has x amount of materials and you don't know the math and you don't know how to do this and your hourly rate for your team and all that. It's like yes, you can do that and people crush it with everything with floors with that. But, yeah, I would just go and start something that's service- based. I have a post on X where I ask people what they would do if they wanted to start from zero and there's a ton of good answers on there. It's affiliate there, stuff like that. But when you're saying offer, that's what I think. Where would you start if you had to start again right now? Um, I answered this in the last one. I basically said I would find an expert and I would build the entire thing around them. And now if I had the experience and understanding I have now, I would be able to get a majority of the company, I would imagine, around some expert and I would just do what I did all over again. Something with a massive backend. So something like financial services, something like um entertainment space that has like high commissions on the back end for placements, something that has like millions of dollars on the back end that you can get uh is something that I would do instead of just something that's info coaching on the front and like supplementary things and like partnership side deals. I would do something that has a massive [ __ ] back end and just put an expert in the front of it. Um a fundamental question, how can a person start an offer with minimum amount of money? I need you to go into detail with which niche you begin in. That's kind of bland. I already answered that with these two. Um, I would find an expert that has all this. I wouldn't need money because they would come to the table and I would be able to organically sell them likely through outreach and through some content and maybe run some small ad budgets and just grip and rip. I would just rip it from from nothing and go from there. Go back to the break. Go back to the breakdowns of your business. They seem more genuine than the random guess. Felt we were friends on those videos. Regardless, keep crushing it. Sorry. Yeah, I decided that I wanted I basically used the first 60 60 videos to build a network and to share, you know, spew a lot of things that were in my brain, what was happening now uh for us. And I still do that. Like today I'm going to do this Q&A. Um tomorrow I have a really good person I want to talk to that's all about another niche within info coaching and selling and exits and stuff like that. And the next day I'm going to do a month in review. Um, it's just it gets a little bit harder to do them every single day once I spew everything out and kind of feels like I'm just like yelling at the computer sometimes. And I don't know, the feedback loop's not super there, but I'm definitely going to continue to share things like as they're evolving and changing in life and in the business. That's what I've been doing. I literally just share what's happening now basically. Um, it was easier a little bit to do in the beginning because we were deep in marketing, so here's all the crazy marketing stuff. Then we were deep in sales, here's all the crazy sales stuff. Uh, now we're doing fulfillment and data stuff. And I'm sure I'm going to share all about our data restructuring and reporting systems and source of truth and automations and all that, but like I just share as we're doing it and we're obviously trying to move quickly so there's enough content to talk about things on a daily basis, but like it's heavy. It's heavy. So, what lean info business model have you seen that scales the hardest, runs with the fewest amount of people, and has the highest net rev employee, and has the long-term durability? What's the most badass one-man operation you've seen so far? Oh boy. Um, the most lean info business model I've seen was probably when I talked to Ahmed and they do the MR stuff and that's in make money online niche kind of, right? So, they're doing trading and stuff like that, but the model just inherently runs really lean, right? It's like community management and that's kind of it for the front layer and then some onetoone or like pre-recorded core stuff that's on the back. It actually flips the business model. Instead of having like done for you on the back that's high ticket, it's done for you as MR low on the front and then the learn how to do it do it yourself is or like done with you on the back that's high ticket which is very interesting. It flips. Um but they have insane high numbers for these. They have crazy margins. It's just nuts. So yeah. Um I would do that one. I mean I I don't play in that game so I have no idea but something that has that model where it's light like that. You want something that is community focused where because when you're saying that it's high, it's low team and high that is like no one to one. It's not that massive where it needs a huge overhead. It's it's lean. It's high ticket generally or mass volume low ticket and it's like community management an expert. That's kind of it, right? All the value is like inherently in there and then inside the community itself. Same thing with the high ticket like masterminds and groups. Those are, you know, they have high cost, too, I guess, but they have lean teams and very high revenues. So, uh, long-term durability, that's hard. I don't know. I don't necessarily know that I have an answer for you on this fully. What's the most badass oneman operation you've seen so far? Um, I don't think it's one man, but Peter Levelvels, I think it's how you say it. I followed that guy for like 15 years or whatever, 10 years, and I've he is no longer a oneman operation, but basically, I mean, he has crushed and done so many things building in public. He's a badass. Um, and he's more in like the development space or like developers, but he crushes. Uh, inside info, I don't know who's a one man that's gotten too far, nor do I think there really should be. I mean, you hear these guys say that there's going to be a oneman AI business that hits a billion dollars and like all the power to him. I just don't know that game well enough. So, you need some point of leverage. So, you need code, you need capital, you need something um that can scale in that way. Um, how would you structure a funnel and for a community plus live course that helps people get promoted in their specific role? Right now we structured as a free community, low ticket or free webinar and upsell to a boot camp. So that helps them get so I think you're talking about like for employment you're trying to help somebody who's sales man a sales rep learn how to become a sales manager I think is what you mean here. So right now you have a structured as a free community low ticket or a free webinar and then upsell to a boot camp. Um, depending, you could probably just go straight to the boot camp. I mean, yes, free is great, but first off, I would pick a niche. Um, and I would focus on it. So, in my example, you pick sales reps and then you go to sales managers. Um, versus, oh, it's like all middle management people that want to go to VPs or something like I feel like it just it's going to there's so many of whatever niche people that if you're the best of the best. I know a group that does it for a specific type of athlete that is very specific to a position and whatever and they [ __ ] crush crush like seven figures a month like cook. So they do a uh direct to group basically or like coaching style thing that has no free anything. Um they do like free guides and stuff for lead flow but that's it. And then they just sell direct so they don't have to manage a free community. They don't have to sell some little low ticket thing. A free webinar. Yes. So, I you could just even run free webinars to a lead list or get leads for a free webinar and then push them to this boot camp with the right process. I don't know what the ticket is or what, but like generally speaking that as long as you're selling the result. This whole thing goes back to that offer, right? As long as you have a good offer, which is, you know, again, Horoszy's book. I keep pointing over there because it's on that shelf. Um, but yeah, also it's 8:30 on a Friday. So, sorry if I'm uh I'm a little drowsing. How would you I'd love to hear about your process for handling no-show meetings. What does the sales rep do? What is the HubSpot workflow? What kind of success would you have rebooking no-shows? Um, so for us, these fire into a channel. So they have an automated email that goes out that's like, "Hey, you know, we missed you." Or like, "Where were you? Here's how you reschedule." And basically just send them that automation. Um, we have a for us it's no showcanc. They kind of trigger the same one. Um, which is different than a reschedule. Very important there. Um, but then we have them fire into a channel and then setters reach out to them and, you know, hammer them to try and get them back on the phone and figure out why they didn't make it, understand if they're still serious about it and then rebook them on the calendar. So, workflow is pretty simple. Just, you know, an email. Uh, we used to have an automated text that did it, but now we have actual people that do it, so it fires into a channel to notify them. And then what's our rebooking from no shows? Uh, it's pretty low, honestly. I mean, someone who doesn't show on that, if they don't come up with an excuse or a reason or whatever within x amount of hours, they're gone. And then we do have a ton of them that'll rebook themselves later through marketing assets, but we don't t spend too much time and like resources around hitting them. That'll probably change as the setter team grows to, you know, dial five a day. Go hard on it, but until then, nothing crazy on here. Know you're into info, but would love your insight. Agency is doing 20K a month in revenue. Nice. With 13K in profit. Nice. Seven clients. It Is it too early to hire an SDR offshore mostly commission and focus on building a scalable outbound sales team? Main bottleneck right now is just leads. We have backend. Yes. Yes. If your main bottleneck for growth is you just don't have inbound of clients, then yes, hire an SDR, it's any of the acquisition sources, it's paid ads, it's organic content, it's referrals, it's partnerships, it's whatever. It's all the things. It's outbound. It's like, you know, again, there going back to Horoszi, but read the leads book. Like there's a bucket of there's a lot of different ways to get clients. Find one that's predictable uh and scalable and consistent and hammer it and just have one. All you need is one and just have it as a steady flow that you know that you get 17 meetings a week and every week you have 17 of those and you know 10 of them show and four of them close or whatever your math is and you're good and the next bottleneck that'll break is the back end and then you fix that and then when you're ready for the front end to get bigger and your traffic source won't go any higher for whatever reason you have another one. ori had another video on this where they talked about it where it's like basically over a million a month is when you can start to talk about having multiple sources. But really what it's all about is just getting to a point where you have consistency and this consistency can scale to the level of what you can fulfill on and grow to. What are some of the best courses to take on paper call? Uh Adam Young has one on YouTube. It's a little outdated but not crazy. I mean it's still extremely valuable. Um where he goes through like 26 hours of the entire paper call industry so you have the understanding. He also has a book I have right here. The paper call revolution is a good one. Uh Carlos um Jr. has a uh course and community and all this kind of stuff. All for paper call. Um the LFG show on YouTube is um I'm forgetting the name, but those guys uh talk about all this kind of stuff. And there you'll find people who have them and there's a bunch of people. I mean it's a little closer held to the chest I think from my perspective, but there's plenty of people that do it. Um the one that I just did with Nate Anellet, he talks about doing brokering for paper call. So it's basically an understanding of paper call industry and then how to become a broker. Not so much like, you know, how to buy and set up landing pages and stuff. But yeah, you can find the guys just go to like LFG show, watch people on there, follow them on, you know, Instagram socials. Certain ones share certain things, certain ones have courses, some have masterminds, mentorship. Hi Ryan, can you make a video on the bless best places to find talent such as copy and creative? Obviously, P&L is a factor, but if you could break down the points at which getting top talent made an impact, where you found this talent at different P&L levels, hope this makes sense. Example, if you're at 30K a month, would what would you recommend for talent? If it's not this point, when does it become worth it? Um, all right, couple things here. So, for copy and creative, I would go in places that copy and creative people live. So, for example, a good one is nothing held back uh Facebook group. They have a job board. So, two different groups. One is like the community normal one, the other one is a job board. There are plenty of people that are all copywriters and creative um stuff on Georgie has a group those are you know more tactical like a like those guys crush and they have uh you know it's going to affect your P&L a little bit more but a lot of them will do retainer deal plus percent they'll do like a bunch of different stuff so it just depends on what caliber you're looking for but I would start there um the break points that when getting top talent made an impact is when you can't do it as well or your bandwidth isn't there hiring where it hurts. Um, so for us, we had a copywriter early. The co-founder was an extremely good uh copywriter, media buyer, all the things and spent for us up to like 20K a day. So that was kind of like a nonpoint for us. Um, but yeah, we definitely had creatives come in who did all the ads that was like Upwork style stuff. We had a copywriter that came in that did two emails a day and some scripting, but co-founder did a bunch of that. But yeah, if you need to find one, I would go in that group. And there's not a specific uh revenue threshold. It's more so when it becomes a bottleneck or when it hurts. So you'll know if you're not doing enough volume on creative and ads and stuff or you should know. And that's when you need to hire it over here. And then over here if you know you have too many leads but they're not closing. It's because your sales isn't good or because you don't have enough sales reps. If if you know they can't book out in two-day windows because you don't have enough volume or enough reps to handle the volume. So yeah, I would just think about it like that. What's the what's their point? When to acquire talent? I think that's probably the same person I would assume. But yeah, same thing. Hire when it hurts. We overhired and hired into the future a little too much. when there is a time and place for that when you're being proactive when the P&L can support it. But off the rip, I wouldn't. I would just hire where it hurts. I would try and do all the things. I would learn how it works and then I would try and find somebody who is amazing at it and then broker a deal that is, you know, paying them at market or above so you can keep them uh and have the P&L support it or break them into some sort of, you know, basically performance deal that scales with how they scale that's directly tied to what they do. So basically focused on you know an example of a sales manager that can come in and crush it can get a percentage of the revenue uh that they produce within their team and then you know they want to push it harder so they make more money and it's aligned. You want to make sure your per performances and bonus pools are in alignment with things that actually are growing the business so that you're not coming out of pocket more as you scale or in the wrong direction because of not their work and then you are losing you know profit dollars on that. So, when to acquire it though is just when it hurts. When you see that there's clear, when you see that, you know, there's a gap that's occurring or something continues to break or something's not optimized, you'll know and that's when you hire for it. I'm studying I'm starting a CRM and lead management agency focused on real estate. Nice. Mainly for uh for wholesalers and agents. I'm not into sales or cold calling, but I like the backend side. Systems tagging, lead routing, pipeline cleanup. Right now, I do W2 for a wholesale. I do this W2 for a wholesaler, but I want to build my own service business offering this to others. A few questions I'd love to take on. Do you think there's real demand for CRM and lead management without offering uh you're going to know that better than I am is there is if there's real demand for CRM and lead management without offering lead genen or cold calling. You know, you're getting them the result, right? You're not selling them the lead management. You're selling them what the lead management gets them. And if that includes cold calling and lead genen, then yes, you're going to likely need that. um it's a lot more difficult to sell like tech and infrastructure systems unless you can like reasonably say because you're you're not selling them that you're selling them the output same way that you're not selling AI to a company you're selling them what the AI does for the company what the automation does so you know if you need to find a partner that's either another company or a person or something that offers that part of the service and that makes your offer amazing then you need to do that is go high level worth the cost when starting out or is there a leaner way for full CRM it's probably the best way and definitely the most scalable I don't really mess with go high level just cuz I like my dedicated tools and that's just personal preference. I know people who crush with goh high level. I know people who have massively scaled it. I know some of the top affiliates for go high level. Uh I just never got into it. But I've definitely built instances in it and seen where you can have multiple people in it and sub accounts and all that stuff very easily. So it may help with your fulfillment and you can also charge them through the white label thing. So you can make more money as a recurring subscription, not just a one time or whatever offer. What are the bare essentials I should focus on to get the first two or three clients. Appreciate what you do. Been watching for a while. Um, I would use those case studies and results. So, build as much examples and resultbased stuff of what you've done with your current W2. That's like, you know, I built this lead management system and it took us it took the 10,000 leads we had and optimized it so we got five% of them that converted and like that's crazy because market average is 1%. or I built this automation that did automat that does follow-ups that gets a 62% response rate and industry average is 12 or like nobody even hits theirs or you're leaving $10,000 a month on the table inside your CRM because you don't have this automation like stuff like that and then I would reach out just direct to basically people that are like your employer and I'm not trying to diss on that and like I don't know your relationship but find other wholesalers. You either know them already or you can find them very easily in whatever group or LinkedIn or whatever that you can find them. find where they hang out and come to them with I can get you this result and then when selling them off the rip, you already have experience, so it shouldn't be that hard to offer money. Uh try and do some sale that's some ROI justification. You pay me five grand and I'll find you 15 or do some performance deal if it's just your time. If it's some time, then you're going to go, I'm going to build this out and we're going to take however many leads and on the tail end that come through my automations or the increase, I'm going to get X per deal or I'm going to get a percent or I'm going to get whatever. Um and I think that would be helpful. My wife's a dietitian and lactation consultant. Interesting. I don't know what that means. Uh, looking to launch a coaching program for women in pregnancy and early motherhood. That explains why I don't know what that means. Um, goal is to hit six figures without a huge client load. What would you recommend for packaging the offer, getting the first wave of high ticket clients? All right. So, she's a dietitian and lactation. I was kind of kidding. Uh, about consultant and wants to launch a coaching program. So, goal to hit six figures without a huge client load. Uh, six figures a year, I assume you mean, is only 10 grand a month. Um, which is not hard. So, that's two people at 5K a month. Uh, if your goal is that a month, you either need to be okay with a little bit more volume and be okay with 20 a month or whatever. Um, right. 20 a month. Yeah. Um, at 5K in the example. or you need to sell something that's higher ticket which means you need to target someone that is more affluent or this solves something that is absolutely revolutionary that people are willing to pay some top dollar even if they are not affluent. Uh what I mean by that is if you have some magic pill that helps them do XYZ in their pregnancy or early motherhood not actually a pill but like you know this crazy offer you will get people who pay you 25 grand. You will get people who pay you 50 grand. Um, and you can easily hit that if this is more of just kind of like a group or whatever coaching style thing with helpful whatever and it really changes them and like you can sell the benefits of the result being this changed experience in life and like major thing. There's like nothing more important than your health and your wellness and your family and like the people around you. And if framed correctly, that is actually a very easy to sell. Um, as long as you get the result and you're not scummy. So yeah, uh, I would package the offer. I would read that book. I keep talking about it, but read uh Hormosy's offers book and package something up that helps these women uh get the result and price it accordingly and then go after a market of those women, a niche of those women in whatever market that attend XYZ class or gym or this style or are in this type of employment or are self-employed or whatever that'll have the you know funds to do so depending on how you structure your offer. So, hope that was helpful. You can ask again in a little more detail. all my people to help and I wasn't being I was sorry I was being jokey. Uh what would you do about how or how would you go about acquiring clients for info products and coaching programs? I have a results and case studies but a poor acquisition system. Same thing I've said before. There's 92 there's a thousand different guys in info and coaching that have videos on this that are free. There's courses or case studies on how to get uh clients. There's organic, there's paid, there's partnerships, there's a there's all the things. Um, I just, yeah, I mean, that's what I would do is you need to learn how to have an acquisition system. I don't I don't know if you're trying to sell this and you don't know how to do it, which it would be inherently an issue if you're trying to sell an acquisition system and you don't know how to do it. Um, but yeah, this one is very prevalent. You can find a million people that'll talk about this on the internet for free and how to get clients and DM setters and all the things. There's like literally 92 different ways to do this consistently. Uh if you want to partner if you want to partner with an expert and build scale and optimize an info business, what do you think essential operator skills one should have to develop as someone who has never done it? You need to be the everything for everyone. You need to understand the business model better. You need to understand the math. You need to understand the people in the stack. You need to understand what's important and really the math um behind that. And then yeah, I mean you just got to get the boots off the ground right to start. You don't have to think about like oh what happens when we have 50 employees and how do I manage them be a good leader? uh that comes with time and you can develop that skill. The skill is consistency in each bucket. The skill is being able to know your numbers and get consistent acquisition, consistent fulfillment, consistent results flywheel that feed back into the marketing system, consistent sales if you're doing phone, you know, those pieces of the puzzle. Um there's contractors and agencies that do each piece of that puzzle, too, where you can like outsource and then just have a really good product. Like there's a lot of ways to look at it, but message me about this. Actually, DM me about this because I'm curious what you mean. Is the skill ceiling higher for info operators who scale with cold traffic versus those who rely solely on organic traffic? And how do the skill sets differ? Is the skill ceiling higher for info operators or who scale with cold traffic versus um that's a diff that's an interesting one. Um organic. So like me, it's a great example. So I don't have the organic skill. I don't fully know it. I understand this much of it and it's this big and even this much of it I joke of for my stuff I do this much of that right like I I get the 12point checklist and the product the packaging and the this and the that and like I just don't do any of that for my stuff and we haven't done that well in the business we just actually hired someone what's today Friday yesterday Thursday uh to do this on the main brand to give it a go um but the skill set is just different I don't want to say it's like higher or lower it's like one person who's really good at organic and can generate consistency around, you know, basically virality and get the right type of people to watch the content, get the right type of people to convert is a very good skill set and it also generally has a lower cost around it. Um, depending on how the content production and distribution is, but generally is going to be cheaper and have longer tail and deeper audience, easier close rates. The rest of the business model gets easier uh at some level than cold or than cold. Yeah. Which is like you're spending all the money. it can go all to a page that's broken and you can lose all the money in a day. You they're cold, right? So, it's not as easy to sell them on the phone. It's not as easy to get them to show up on the phone. It's not as easy to get to buy them something on a sales page. It's just not as easy. So, I guess I see what you mean by it being like a higher thing, but there's guys who crush at this and some guy in lead genen could come in and just rip it on cold traffic and, you know, assuming they understand the nurturing and the consumption model of info that is necessary to sell whatever you're selling could crush it for you. So, I think that answers your skill sets differ. Um, but yeah, mindset books, like half of these are mindset books and half of them are tactical. Um, I'll have to get back to you on this with like a full list, but like Psychocybernetics is a banger. That's one of my OG ones. Um, Magic of Thinking Big is a good one. Um, I have like the OG stack, like the the originals. So, those are the two that initially come to mind, which probably means something, but some of the newer age ones are actually pretty good, too. I don't know. I don't really like tactics around this. Um, I think books are great around here um for this. And then I also will say there's some banger mindset stuff that come from like Becker and Ovens and that are a little bit more specific to like you and your online business and how you live and how you think. Um they're the ones who you know brought to the newer age at least my bracket of age or understanding of where I was that was all around feedback loops and iteration and goal setting and not like affirmation but just kind of like framing your life living in identities transferring yourself into a future identity because that future person is the one who you know is at that goal. It's you have to change as a person to hit the goal, not the goal has to just, you know, happen. A lot of good stuff there. So, I would look up those. I think they have those actually free now online on YouTube. How do you guys how you guys your sales manager recruit rep? Oh, how do we recruit new reps? Um, so we'll do postings. Now that we're just known in the space, it's easy. So, now we just get inflow of them. We can post in groups. Again, nothing held back group is a great one. Um, there are guys that have, I'm forgetting the name of the software, but they have a whole software you pay like $400 for and then you get access to their entire pool and then as long as your offer hits this, this, and this, you're going to get a flood of applications. This is not really a hard one. There's just so many high ticket reps now. Um, there's what's her name? Uh, Shelby Sap. Like they have Shelby, Cole Gordon, like she has one that's like really all for females. Kohl's is not all for males, but mainly probably is. and like they have an entire system where they teach reps and or teach them how to be reps and then either sell them on the back or just you know make them available to the marketplace to do that. Um but yeah, we have recruited a bunch out ourselves. Our new sales manager has connections with a bunch that are coming in. Our old sales manager had a bunch that of connections that came in. We will post on some platforms sometimes, but like if you're looking for high ticket closers, there's a it's a it's like a unique part of it of the industry. It's not just like a sales rep who's like from manufacturing. It's like a high ticket remote sales rep. Like they know the gambit. They know the current situation versus desired situation and your yours solves that. They know like the script that's been passed around. So, I would try and find somebody that's already in the industry. Um, generally speaking, just, you know, watch your culture. Uh, financial modeling, ad campaigns, and your process for fixing bottlenecks and ads. Um, yeah, this is something I heard the other day was someone and I'm going to have one with uh the Alchemist Kid uh later this week and he's going to talk a lot a lot about this, I'm sure. Um, but yeah, I've heard you can completely dump all this and drop it into GPT nowadays. I haven't done this, but I've heard you can. Um, overall how I would look at this is like everything is a funnel, right? It's like if your click-through rates are ass, then you know, and your cost per click is this, but your optin rate, you know, you got to look down the funnel. It's like you can see within the different layers inside the ad manager what's happening and what's going wrong. You can see if clickthrough rates are not good. You can see if cost per clicks are out of whack. You can see if like these different things as you go down the thing down the chain from eyeball impression all the way down to purchase, you know, clickthrough rate, cost per click, landing page view, lead, app, booking, phone, like you can go all the way down the list and see them. Um I don't know. I don't know if that's a good answer for you, but yeah, there's a lot of this. There's also AI tools you can plug in. I was on a call with some like the eight figure or whatever it's called, the 8 figure uh info guys thing, and these guys were talking about how they use uh like that magix's AI tool uh for their ad accounts to set reminders and like find things inside the ad account. So, I heard that's a really good one, but yeah, I don't have a ton of experience on this. B2B SAS info product. I don't know that I know of that to be honest. B2B SAS to info. I know I've seen a lot of info products that try to go to SAS um or do already do this. Um but B2B SAS, I mean essentially generally that's like you're selling I don't know what you're selling. You're selling information on how to use the software. You're selling coaching on the back end of how to use the software, get the result. Like they're buying the SAS because usually what would happen is if they're be if they're buying the SAS, they're trying to get the result or use the tool to get the result, right? They're buying it for some reason in that way. an info product is then you know more of the same or the next problem that happens is once you get this result you have this issue and here's the information on how to solve that is kind of like how you'd look at it it's like what's the ascension ladder what's the chain in doing that and is it info or is it coaching is it onetoone is it group um is it completely personalized and done for you or is it you know do it yourself and just give them login access to a course I don't really know the context here with this much information but like yes it's doable I just can't think of an example couple more guys uh hey brother Rock, God bless. Thank you. Quick question about optimizing our funnel for conversion rates. We're running I love these. We're running an opt-in funnel VSSL to book a call and an opt-in. Okay, so it's opt-in VSSL app likely book a call for our e-commerce bisop offer. We're currently most of our bookings are from our setters calling optins or people responding to automated via text. Very few leads are self-scheduling through our survey to calendar flow. Interesting part is our best prospects are are the ones who complete everything. Of course, 100% because they have the highest intent. Here's what I'm wondering. Should we extend our current two-minute timer, which unlocks the survey that allows them to book to boost those self-induced booking self? No, not my opinion. I mean, test it, but or do we go back and fix the VSSL itself? How do you typically diagnose where the drop off is happening in a funnel like this? What's your process for identifying whether it's a timing issue versus a messaging offer problem looking to maximize? I love this question. Okay. So, if you have an opt-in funnel, then you are getting them as a lead. So, that's what you're saying is you're getting their name, email, phone number, and you are calling them and and then you're able to call them because they drop off. So, your VSSL is not doing its job. So, a lot of things that happen here. Once you get their name, email, phone number, you can call them, you can email them, you can text them, you can do all those things. They are landing on the VSSL and they are not making it to in this you said twominut timer, which is nothing. Ours is 18 minutes or whatever, 14 minutes or seven, like depending on the VSSL length. The CTA is like 80% of the way through the VSSL. We are then hammering them with emails because we don't even ask for phone number. We're then hammering them with emails. If you stay to the end of the VSSL, you get these bonuses. We're going to send them to you by email. We send everyone the bonuses by email. You're sending them an email immediately that says, "Hey, here's your training." You're sending them 25 minutes after saying, "Here are the bonuses for staying till the end." Even if they didn't stay to the end, you're then sending them another email another day later. Like you're doing that through email. So then they're going to come back and they're going to land on a page that's here are your bonuses. They're on the bottom of the page, your VSSL here, a testimonial wall that they scroll through and then the bonuses. Bonuses are free value that then ascend them into booking a call and applying. So that whole machine exists and then your VSSL just seemingly doesn't work because we still have a ton that come through direct. So they wait for that full 18 minutes. You need to get a tool for this portion. Where do you see where that drop drop off is happening? You need to see the VSSL stats. So you need to see the engagement rate, the drop off, the time of the VSSL, what the drop off is. So there's uh tools like, excuse me, there's tools like Vidalytics is what we use. I've heard there's a cheaper one that I don't use. It's like tid something. I don't know the name of it. Um you can ask around, but there's another one out there. Um but Vidalytics is what we use and it'll show you how many people click the play. It'll click show you where the drop off point like it's a chart like this. You'll see like and like how many stayed to the end, how many stayed to the CTA mark. You can do all that stuff. Um, but this is a VSSL issue. And then it's like if your beginning is like has this crazy drop off, it's like, okay, make three new leads and then all of a sudden you'll have one that goes to 30% over here and you're like, "Oh, that's the move." And then you change it to that one and your calls jump three times. Um, and yeah, so I'd focus on that. And then also the whole machine around it. If you're not emailing, texting, and doing all these things, if the VSSL isn't framed in a way that's to get them to stay to the end, if you're not offering a bunch of value with it or like why they should stay, like you got to optimize all of that whole piece of it. Um, but it sounds good that you're getting these and you're you're getting people to book and call even through text and stuff because they're clearly interested in whatever's on the opt-in page. They're in the result, the overarching thing that's in the training. So, you're you're on the right track 100%. I like this question a lot. Thank you. Appreciate the value you're dropping in your videos. I've been a closer for a couple different offers in B2C and B2B for two years. I used to run ads for an agency for local businesses. I've done well as a closer over 3 million collected. Nice. And I love sales, but I'm stuck at around 15 to 20K. I'm starting to burn out. Yeah, that's kind of the model is top closers like our models will make 30 or 40, but they are cranking if they're doing that. So like this is kind of par for the course. Uh want want more freedom to take the next career step. I'm wondering based on your view in the online what do you see as the next step for a sales rep? I'm considering either starting my own B2C info offer helping beginners get into sales or helping sellers closers make more money starting from my own sales agency or becoming a sales manager for an info offer. For context, my end goal is to build a business that gives me freedom. I enjoy running and getting into a $50 million network before 30. I'm 20. This is aggressive. This is a aggressive. So 50 million not not to say it's not a possibility. I know people who have done it for sure. But to do it through what vehicle is the better question here. And just doing it with like an info off or whatever, like you'd have to likely have an exit or you'd have to cash flow soing heavy and have very lax zone in order to do that in the next seven years. Um but like you can do it, anyone can do it. People have done it in one year. So like this is not a [ __ ] on that and I hope that's comes across right. Um of your three options starting a B2C info offer. A lot of people are doing this so you got to stand out of the crowd. Same with this. A lot of people are doing this. Starting on sales agency, a lot of people are doing this and yes, a lot of people are doing this. The beauty of this one is if you can bolt yourself into one that is scalable, that is has a plan of an exit that you can get equity in that you can do whatever you can get closer to this. The beauty of these is you have full control of everything and you like the sales agency for example. I know guys that are doing hundreds of thousands a month. Um I don't think I know directly anyone who's doing over a million a month with this model. Um but that it cranks you know you take 20% of someone's sales, you take 25% of someone's sales uh of their company and you run everything. You have sales management, you have closers, you have setter management, you have setters um and you just run that full thing. So, I mean, you have the experience, but you need to get more reps in any of these to like scale to any of these kind of numbers, which is everyone. That's life. So, starting your own offer could be cool um for B TOC. Uh this one is more mass market, so you could ramp it. It's going to take more marketing skills than it is sales skills in my opinion because you need to get in front of enough eyeballs to do enough volume uh to be able to sell something like this to get to a million, five million, 10 million a year. Um and then you know to get to these numbers you need to be at hundreds of millions over the next seven years which is again doable. Um but yeah so sales manager one is probably the next natural iteration where you could do that if you have no uh no no experience managing. It's going to be hard to go enter into somewhere as a manager. Uh especially like an experience like without the experience of managing people. Um it's going to be easier to grow as a sales rep into a manager in the company you're in. Um the sales agency one a lot of people are doing that. You can give it a go and just see how much you can scale it. see if you can get pieces of people's companies, see if you can get, you know, the rev share model is real. It's just you only make a spread because then you have to hire your team and manage it and you make your three, five, 10, whatever percent uh once you have economies of scale. So, hope that makes sense. Hopefully that was helpful. Um, you're crushing it, dude. I mean, you're 23, you're you're making, you know, 250 grand a year. I mean, there's a lot of options for you. There's a lot of options for you. So, for the next Q&A, this is the next Q&A. uh have been running organic YouTube and it's been slow as YouTube is typical for the as YouTube typically is for the past 12 to 18 months. One two high ticket high ticket clients a month and a month or two without any finance funding travel offer. Interesting. Looking to run ads for the for it to generate more lead flow and app bats but don't want to go crazy on spend as it's a lean team essentially solo operations. It possibly get a good idea to also run ads to a digital product. If so, how would you set that up? direct to cart with long funnel copy or even a VSSL explained digital product and then for those that purchase having them also join a free community where you can nurture them further on live calls thinking this through I feel a good idea to work on both with ads and not only to grab data but to have more people in the free community to eventually sell them later on high ticket what are your thought process on the situation all right so you're talking about a lot of things here you're talking about having a low ticket product talking about having a free community that they get in which is actually a paid community because you're having them pay for it you're talking about having a free community standalone and you're talking about selling high ticket and you're talking about doing it from organic and you're talking about doing it from paid. So organic must not be working at the scale or the offer isn't good enough because I don't know you got to we have to see the funnel here. So if you're getting a thousand clicks from your organic a month and you're getting no units or no sales it's like it's not a good acquisitions like you you don't have enough flow out of a thousand clicks you should be converting higher like somewhere in the chain is broken and I need more data on that part of it. Uh ads are going to be quicker but yes they have a cost. Running to high ticket you're going to get a quicker higher return in my opinion unless you have something you know how to do this low ticket piece. The other way is running a organic to a free community could totally be a move and all you're doing is funneling them into there for XYZ results or to be in there for XYZ reason. And then from there you can nurture them you can set them. You can provide value and you can only do CTAs inside your free community for your paid stuff or to book a call or to get XYZ result. And then your organic just acts as getting them into the free. And then the free just acts as getting them into the high ticket or the paid. So I would do that. Uh I don't know that you need to I I don't know the funnel math. I don't know the count of clicks and the count of views and the stuff you're getting right now. Um but it sounds like you have like the right idea. Um this is just my opinion, but yeah, direct to cart with long funnel copy is generally speaking hard. Um and especially hard if you don't have the backend system built to where you know how to ascend them up or like get them from the community. So if you already have a community, learn how to nurture and pull people from the community that 3% of the people in the community ascend to your high ticket or whatever and then work on getting flow of consistency from organic into free community and then that free community upselled into paid. Like that's a very classic funnel. That's horos you know that's a big portion of how they do it at school is free community to paid community or free community to high ticket you know group which has a community stuff like that. So I hope that was helpful but I don't really know what this offer is either. That's kind of finance funding and travel. I don't really know what that is, but simple, easy setup for running ads to an offer. Simplest funnel uh is going to be a DTA funnel. H that's maybe not true that we'll use that is going to be a headline, a VSSL, and an application. They apply, book a call, and get on the phone with you. It's the easiest one. Uh the hardest part of that is going to be the VSSL portion and that's, you know, kind of it and then obviously the sales call. But you get a lot of feedback. You can talk to people. you can understand, you know, how they got there, the flow on a phone that you won't be able to get if you send them to a sales page because all you're going to do is see a heat map of them clicking around and doing their thing and like that's it. So, I think that's probably the easiest one. And then, yeah, all back to the offer. Biggest thing here is the offer. You could have the ugliest page, the ugliest funnel, the worst converting one. You could have a funnel that doesn't work and that people have to send you an email or send you a postcard in the mail in order to purchase. And if your offer is good enough, you will have thousands of postcards. So, focus on the offer and then back into a very simple funnel. I have explanations of all of our funnels and a bunch of other people have million of these. Cole Gordon just dropped a really good video talking about this where he walks through the different funnels they've used with, you know, um, free posting and like community stuff to high ticket or like uh, VSSL opt-in funnels to all that. So, yeah, hopefully that was helpful. 58 minutes almost on the hour daily update. Today was day 79 in a row of doing these videos. Uh, you can see them all here. www. Got to use that because I broke clickfunnels. Uh,.comdoc. It's a notion board. You can sort by tech, marketing, sales, ops, mindset, all the things. See all the videos that fall into that bucket. I've been doing interviews with some people that I've now met through this. And those replace some of the daily videos of just these info Q&A funnel build style ones. And yeah, guys, we just hit 75 million today. So, get that third disc. so I can finally be fancy. There's really no ego, no flex is like I literally have friends that have like five times this and I'm a little fish, but it's nice meeting everyone and being able to provide some value. And I really hope you got like a nugget out of here, thought of something in a different way. Sorry, I'm a little exhausted.
