What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about culture and team building in the info coaching space. There are a lot of differences between info coaching and other online business models and other business models in general. So, we're going to specifically break down our core values, departments, meeting cadence, communication cadence, how they differ in info coaching versus other online business models, and then kind of talk through some new concepts we're coming up with around these that we're going to roll out based on an event we're at. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 76 million actually in total cash collected and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. Old goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people building cool All right. Again, sorry I'm on the road. I'm in London and we're at Eman's event. I don't know if you can see this, but 8 figure manor mastermind got some big day. So, we are learning new things and just getting a lot of perspective, right? So, uh, we have an info coaching business that's a little bit different than a lot of others. Uh, ours is not this big massive margin cash flow biz. Uh, ours is a little bit more focused on mass scale now and how we've built it. And that's solely because of how we built it. So, we're going to walk through some of these today. Um, and I think you're going to get a gist. So, for us, again, we're always a work in progress. We learn something and we adapt. We learn something new. We adapt another direction. Sometimes things, you know, but heads, sometimes they don't. Um, so where we're at currently with our core values is future focused. We truly truly live this uh in our main business. Um definitely live this like everything that we're doing is for 3 months from now, a year from now. Foundationally built now. For a long time there's a lot of duct tape. It was a right now cash thing. It was a right now decision thing. And now it's much more future focused which we love. World class. Think of that like a players. Think of that like just doing the best by the customer. Think of that in all ways. It's just world class. We have the best tech. We have the best people. We have the best systems. We have the best conversations. We have the best results for the clients. We have the best. We have the best world class. Okay. Radical transparency. This is a little bit on client side, but mainly meant on like an internal team side. And this is around for us just like truth. Truth from personal to professional. Truth from how you show up here to how you show up there. Truth for all those things. Um this has been this one's been with us for a while. Um but it really kind of like sticks through and true. And we've had definite moments. I've had definite moments of this like 100% where had to just come through and be radically transparent on fuckups I've made or situations or things. Same with across the company is really important to us. And then extreme ownership kind of stacks on that one at least in my head. Um to where you know everything is extreme, you know, extremely owned ownership like it truly is on you to do things and take responsibility and own it. Uh and I do view those two as kind of like not one and the same but they stack on each other. So I like these core values for us. Um yesterday was a big conversation around basically team and culture building. Um and what Eman's built is like really fantastic what they have in their team and the culture they have. So for us the departments are broken out like this in current state. So marketing, sales, CS, product, tech, finance and people. These ones are kind of the two funky ones because finance is essentially me and we need to hire in for that sooner than later. Um people is the same as product right now for the lead and then CS sits within those. So it's really kind of like these three in one. Tech and finance are in one because of me and then sales and marketing are standalone. Um because we're very very acquisition focused right now or like heavy. So we're very direct response style. Um meeting cadence wise around this and kind of to back up on here though real quick. So departments so they were sharing a bunch of different examples of how they have their company set up. I was talking to people next to me that were doing 30 million a year in info um that were way leaner than us which is interesting. Um I was talking to you know Iman and their team and how structured they are and all these guys have great margins and it's like we don't um in that way until we're at a certain scale because of how we built it and how we're trying to build it. So just kind of like an interesting point of view to see how they have their structured um where certain things are like there's um you know guerilla style team on there that can do multiaceted pieces of the work. Another big part of this is um kind of bouncing all over the place but welcome. I'm traveling. So, um, is the global talent pool that all these guys use. We focus like almost exclusively on W2, uh, inside the US and it's a huge cost and it's also a different style of work ethic. Not to say you can't find them, but it's just like a different average uh, style. Um, so yeah, it's just been interesting to see like where we're positioning this thing is going to continue to stay in that lane. Um, but a lot of these guys will have some like worldwide arbitrage on talent that's not something that we currently uh take advant uh, use or take advantage of. So with the meeting cadence around those departments, we have a marketing weekly. We have a sales daily which is also a sales for closers and then a sales for huddle uh I'm sorry for uh setters as well. CS kind of talks daily already. Product talks once a week and then again all these all talking communication channels and then everywhere all the time but like actual meetings that occur. Um tech happens weekly kind of uh tech is only that happens right here in this operations department and then there's an operations cross and then for the department ones it's every single one. So it's like think of it like this on a calendar. It's like, call it, let's just use examples, 9 or 10:00 a.m. to noon. Uh, so that 2-hour block on Tuesday and Thursday. This block right here is going to be for uh cross department ops. And then this one is going to be for dedicated. So like in 30-minute blocks for four departments. So we're going to go product, then we're going to go marketing, no, we're going to go tech, then we're going to go um product, then we're going to go marketing, then we're going to go sales. So that's like how we currently operate it on like an operational level. Um but for the um for the divisions themselves, they only operate on these. So one of the interesting things that we learned while we were at the event um was that a lot of these guys will do daily huddles, which is super interesting to us. Like entire department daily. So they'll have uh you know 40 50 people on one meeting for about 30 minutes and they'll go through updates just like water cooler talk and just like have fun and do that and then on the other side of it they'll go um and go from there into breakout rooms beyond those. So they will have their main meeting that's like the operations section uh or like the companywide section and then they'll go breakout room so it's just sales and they'll go breakout room so it's just marketing breakout room so it's just this um which I find very interesting. I don't know our team's like very large so I'm not sure 100% if that's something we're going to like take action on for ourselves and do. Um but definitely with the daily portion I think we are going to roll out for the actual department. So sales already does it. I think marketing should do it on daily. I think CS should do it on daily. I think product should do it on daily and tech should do it on daily and just a touch point and just like so people aren't living on an island and just like existing outside of there. Um so keep these and then bring these to daily. So we basically just have like one operational management style version on top and then the actual the example they used was essentially like seale managers and then makers. So like the people boots on the ground. So an simple example of sales but you have like sales rep you have like sales manager and then you have like sea level meeting. So that sales manager would have the sea level meeting and then they would have a daily touch point with all of their team. And I think that that would be really good for us. Um because everyone kind of does live on an island. We haveund whatever people now at this point. Um it's high. It's like 100 I don't I say that because we have W2 and uh contractor and I never know if I should include both of them but you know call it 130 right so yeah team is growing and I think this would be very helpful and continue to keep the culture tight and then communication cadence for us right now exists basically just as I have other videos where I go like deep into this and meeting structure and across this and agendas and you know slack channel breakdowns but right now for us we just talk on Slack and then we talk on Zoom right we have Zoom meetings that are these cadence um and then a bunch of ad hoc stuff and and all the Slack channels in the world. So, we only meet like once or twice a year in person and thus far it's only been basically like Seale or like, you know, owners and operators kind of style. Um, and it might be interesting for us. We were talking to somebody about the math on how to budget this, but it's like, you know, it can easily be a quart million dollars for a trip like this, which is like that's a lot of money that like eats into into margin. Um, but it's so important because like the team is everything. So, we're just trying to navigate how we would be able to do something that could be impactful. One of the things they did, um, actually here, let me roll in this new concept piece. Um, but so yeah, so their new concept that they were talking about that I think we're going to roll is daily huddles on each department. More fun, less people on an island sitting their own thing. Collapse the timelines is an interesting idea, too, is when people are working on projects, like they'll have touch points or like we'll imagine you have a Tuesday and Thursday meeting. Tuesday you decide some stuff that needs to be done by Thursday and then kind of nothing really happens up until that Thursday meeting and then Thursday the next meeting is on Tuesday. So they have all the rest of Thursday, Friday, Monday and then up until Tuesday at the meeting to basically get that one thing done. And of course you can have projects that are that big or need to go further. But like a lot of the time it just kind of like expands the timeline when it doesn't need to be. And it happens because people then exist in their own world out here and it's like oh it's due on Tuesday. But if you're then meeting tomorrow and every day and having the FaceTime, like it's just so easy to hide behind the computer, me included. If it's like if I have someone uh that I'm talking to on Thursday for it due on Tuesday, I'm like, "Oh, cool. I'll do it by Tuesday." And it's like I I think this will be very helpful for our project charter and boards. Um I think that'll be good. And just a deeper stronger culture. Um this less segmented thing we have to solve for somehow because right now it kind of exists like acquisition and like fulfillment kind of are like the pockets. So you have like acquisition um that in current state has like male leadership which is no problem at all and then you know it's we're 97% uh female team um but it's like acquisition side so like marketing sales that exist over here all the sales reps are 90 something% of them are um female and current state and then on the uh fulfillment side it's female leadership and female over here and it's just like we need more blend both of like the roles and like you know again I'm not I don't really care or notice whatever directly on like gender or like whatever you want to call it, masculine or feminine, like everyone blends well together. It's just they don't have enough touch points. Um so it's like we're almost like not fostering the connection um that I think we can have. So trying to come up with a good way in the end. I mean like marketing is going to work with marketing, sales is going to work with sales, CS is going to work with CS, and product's going to work with product, right? Like they are um but I think there could be better touch points. So coming up with something for that cuz right now it's basically just existing within Slack and then on once a month um a all hands meeting with the company. So I think we can do something better that can have more touch points and would be cool and like a deeper stronger culture growth. Um cuz that's definitely something I'm just noticing here is like they were talking so much about culture and you know I'm sure you guys are all waiting for the secret sauce and like the nitty-gritty and the tactics and it's like those come and go those change but if you have the team that can implement them and be on them and like catch the waves and you know just work sidebyside you when it's good and bad the rest just kind of happens. And I was like, that's a very interesting perspective because it's true and it's like I have a great relationship with a lot of people in the in uh the business. But yeah, it's just just an interesting interesting perspective. So um and then yeah, an all company offsite. So figuring out how to budget and build this in and make it like actually feasible where you know because you're spending x amount of dollars and you're also you know we run 247 essentially. So having a model where we can essentially shut down for however many days, no calls coming in, marketing off, like it's a bigger idea than it's a bigger thing than just like oh we have to pay x amount of dollars to like fly everyone and get hotels and like throw on a thing. It's like the whole business shuts down. So you know I would assume so there's like all the opportunity missed cost. There's the ramping up and down of ads and then there's the hard costs of 150 people or 200 people at this time and flights and hotels and events and planning and all that stuff. So, just a cool idea though. Um I know these guys do it for like for example they did a a marathon all together. Um they did they're doing like some climb together. They're doing like all this cool stuff that they do to bring everyone together and they do it around a goal which I really like and that's our culture too is like competitive physical fitness um strong like just it's it's on brand for us. Um so it' be really cool if we could build something like that out. So yeah, that's kind of the general gist of like where we're at with this and thinking about things on like how we can collapse some of these departments into like proper leadership. having a lot of conversations about where I sit on things um and as these people start to take over more things and more so I let go of things which is another big thing is like me and my whole I want to work 16 hours a day all day every day um over time I mean I'm already not effective at that like I should probably be able to do what I do in eight hours I just bounce around between this and this and check this and that and like I want to be able to make sure that we have department heads that are happy and that love their role and that are compensated well for it and you know can handle it and we can be gone for two weeks weeks and then come back and like everything's better than it was when we left. Like we need that. We need to foster into that and get to that point and I think we're definitely in the right direction. Um but it'll just be interesting to see where I land on if I just go work on other things that are still like in parallel like I was talking about in a video two or three days ago where I just kind of move upstream and continue to learn like around the actual scope and sphere of this industry or if it's just kind of just be patient and focus on like literal personal and like self and other hobbies and stuff. so that it's not distraction from work. Like it'll be interesting to see how it navigates. Um because this is like golden goose number one and this is the most important thing to me when it comes to work and what I do on a daily basis. So yeah, it'll be interesting. But that's that guys. Um so where we're at right now is we're currently I want to give you some exact numbers. So I'm grabbing my phone here. Um but we are trending. Last month we finished out at 3 million. Um which was good for us but not great. Um but good for us in the sense that you know before that we were at 1.5 and we're kind of stuck in that little pocket. So uh currently right now we're trending for a little over three and we just changed all of our bookings um over from 30 minute slots to 45 minute slots. So there' be less volume but the idea being less miss calls because they're back to back to back more time for admin work in between deeper calls that can get higher close rate. Right? So like we have to offset that with the volume to the uh close rate. So I'm very interested to see where that goes. is we're going to run a minimum of a twoe test but in current state that puts us at you know low to mid3s which would be good for us you know ticking up in that direction um and then July is usually when we do our special so our special is internal only uh we only do it for renewals at this point um for the July one so you know essentially assume you have a 10k product that's recurring at 10k instead you offer it for 8k and you do it for one week that's essentially what we do so we're like just blast test it out to everyone and then we'll do we usually do like a couple million bucks on that. Um but we're going to test something that's actually higher so it's like less of a discount because we're trying to protect cash flow um or protect margin and push cash flow at the same time. So we're going to kind of like game that a little bit and see. So yeah, that's kind of where we're at. Um slower off the start uh of this month. Um we're technically trending up, but we slowed down from where we finished out last month. So yeah, blah blah blah. I'll just say but uh I have to run to this event. It's actually really good and uh I'm excited to give you guys some updates of what we've learned here so far after day two and three. Um and I'll be flying back in a couple days so I can kind of do like a full recap maybe then. Maybe that would be helpful. But all the videos are here. Um I got to schedule out some more interviews. If you guys check on the channel, I've done a bunch of interviews. Today's day 91 or two in a row of doing these. Um and yeah, I'm just in between sessions right now. Then back to another session, black tie event, all the things. So I appreciate you guys. Check out all the other videos here and I will talk to you soon. Hit me on IG or X.
