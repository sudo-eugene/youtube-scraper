# How Ravi Abuvala Built A $25M Empire Working 3 Days A Week
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ewHW9A18ik

What's up, guys? We're back. I can't say day 123 in a row anymore, but I think it's video number 123. And we've got Ravi. Ravi, how do you say your last name properly? It's actually Abu Vala. Abu Vala. Okay, cool. Thank I was like trying to spell it right. I was like, I don't want to be that guy. But so, I've seen your stuff for years. So, I had Cole on. Cole was like, "Oh, you know, I'm good friends. You got to get him on." And yeah, you made it on the original list. I made a list of hundred something people. And I was like, "Who I want to talk to?" Because again, yeah, followed your content for years, seeing kind of the evolution through the different offers. So, how would you say like what you're currently at? Like what is your business currently? What are your current offers? What's your gist? Yeah. So, uh we essentially it's actually transitioning more into an advisory firm, but it was mostly a consultancy for the past 5 years. We've served almost 3,000 clients at this point. Uh we'll hit 30 million in sales this year. And um mostly we're serving coaches, consultants, course creators, and uh online service providers. And we're typically building marketing systems for them. Um I I'd say in the past 2 years, it's predominantly personal brand and content focused just because of the way that the marketplace is shifting. It's pretty difficult to run paid ads and um relatively saturated in intangible markets like coaching and consulting and invo spaces. Um and so you need to back it up with some personal branding. So, um, uh, that's the primary focus of what we do. And then my advisory firm is like a almost like a holding co. I have a couple of companies inside of there, including my fiance's company, which is a matchmaking service online. Very, very high ticket, almost $30,000. Um, and so, um, we do some decent numbers in that. Um, and there's about five companies in that portfolio. And then I also have fun. I just bought a lakehouse, um, which is where I'm at right now. I I have a couple of boats and planes. And so I I'm more of the work hard, play hard kind of guy than the like work 80 hours a week kind of guy. Um which is actually how cool when I first hung out. Nice. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. I mean you are it's you Dan Martell and I think that's it that I directly would follow that fit in that bucket of like I I model everything, right? So I I'm like I learn how to do things by finding someone who has it who's been where I was get Right. And you and Dan are honestly kind of like the only ones that I see and again it's all online so who knows, right? but kind of give clarity on that. But you two are the only ones I see that do kind of the family, personal life, relationship stuff uh and share it and kind of like align with what my maybe desire of that life would be. So, it's super cool to see that you share that and it definitely stands out as someone who shares that. Yeah, I appreciate you saying that. It's kind of interesting um because like for a couple years it it only really started happening 24 months ago when I really like sat down and I identified what I truly wanted out of my life. Um, and like I at that point it was I was very mimedic like I was like okay if somebody else has this thing I want this thing right and I never had actually figured out like what truly makes me happy. Um, and honestly since I've done that I've I a lot has changed in my life. You know I got engaged like is how I focus on what kind of business I want to run and you know now it's no longer about scale at absolutely any cost like you know 30 ad creatives every single week. You know it's a little bit more like what what why am I doing this and what's the end result in this? And I almost felt a little um uh I almost felt a little like imposttor syndromeesque because my company is called scaling with systems and for so long it was like gassid at any sacrifice. I don't care what happens. And so when I started doing this I was like man I'm kind of afraid like if I start creating content around my personal side like we I just started a vlog channel which I'm I'm I'm three vlogs into that right now. And so like I'm showing a little bit more my personal and so I'm like oh what if people like call me out like oh you're not working as hard as you need to. Um, and it it's kind of funny because I realized like that's truly the great thing about content in my opinion is like there is a niche for anybody out there. And so instead of you having to be somebody you're not in order to be the entertainer that is attracting all these people, you can just continuous to be the person that you're uh adapting into as you get older and you get more and more experiences and you will attract the people that are attracted by that. and and so instead of it being a weakness now I see it almost as a strength and and Dan's actually a good friend of mine as well and him and I have talked about that as well. It's like you know it's like you're literally just being yourself as cheesy as that sounds and then because you're being yourself you're going to attract people that look up to that kind of lifestyle and so it's it's been quite the journey. It it seems easy for me just to be like, "Oh, yeah, I do all the" But I've been doing all that stuff for years, but I was like so afraid to ever show anybody I was taking any time off of work because I was afraid that I wasn't going to be the grind 80 hours a week and, you know, hustle to make all the kind of money kind of guy. Yeah. No, the content thing's real. I mean, it's like you stand out. Um, Ovens, Iman, Hormosi, like the guys who have more or less steadily produced content and kind of been like top of mind or front of screen. Um, that over the time have shown the progression. Cole even right when he talks about his it's like it was this I mean he goes all the way back to like I was working at traffic and funnels to I was over to here to holding codes and how all that didn't work and how he's going back to XYZ but B2B and like it's cool to see when that content exists. I didn't start doing this until like literally four months ago just every day. So like I just try to ram it all into a short amount of time 120 days in a row just like boom boom boom. Um but no it's it's super cool to see. So the business doing 30 that's that's sizable um for info coaching. Yeah. So, like did they 30 in total or 30 this year? Uh, 30 in total. No, we'll probably do like eight and a half this year. Yeah. Still and you're and you're in the camp of I always talk about how I love your ads. They stick out so much to me. The one that's the Hyru screenshot cuz like only if you know do YouTube organic organic. I'm like people that are listening this are like what's Hyros like you know what I mean? But like that was I got know what Hyros is but people Yeah. Yeah. No, it was it was like 40k piff 20k piff 20k piff 20 YouTube. Yeah, it's it's I actually just did a webinar right before this this uh presentation I was showing. I have that on my webinar as well because it's like it's just undeniable proof cuz I have 6 I think right now we're at 630 published videos on YouTube and every single one of them has their own tracking YouTube highross parameter every video. So like I c I can not only say the entire client journey of the 30 million that we've made but I can also say the exact videos that they watched and clicked on and and last year 50% of our high ticket clients the last thing they did before they became a client according to Hyros last source was YouTube actually 48%. So um yeah it's been massive for us and so that's just been me doubling down and and that's why I launched this vlog channel. I launched a secondary YouTube channel. Um, I'm actually even taking the gas off of Instagram a little bit right now because once again, I'm going more towards like what do I actually want to do, not what's going to make me the most money. And if I'm just being really transparent, Instagram is probably the content channel that I like the least. I like consuming it the least because I feel like I'm just putting a Dyson vacuum up to my brain cells and getting it sucked down. And um, I also like producing for the least because it kind of, you know, in somebody else's words, these aren't my words, but they said it so well, I'm just going to repeat it. They said, "I always felt like Instagram um uh watered down your brilliance." So, you know, the brilliance is obviously an egotistical term, but the sense being that I have I love depth and I love like really explaining things like on my iPad for an I just published an hour and a half video today on YouTube today about sales funnels. Like that's what I love. So then to like do the the gimmicky 60-second 90 second thing on Instagram to capture somebody's attention for like literally 3 seconds before they hop off, it just wasn't me. So, I'm not saying I'm never going to go back to it again, but um but uh yeah, YouTube has always been such a high driver. So, I was like, "Okay, well, I've already bought back so much of my time. What if I just stopped doing Instagram and spend all that additional creative energy into YouTube?" And that's why we actually launched the vlog channel. Nice. Yeah, I know. It totally makes sense. I mean, I I have the context because I followed your stuff for so long. So, I remember the like the MR engine you were working for a minute there. I remember then a lot of paid the D you guys ran like a lot of we call them DTA but like direct application funnels like the headline VSSL app right there we do a ton of opt-in funnels VSSL optin funnels because we like the consumption everything we do is paid so like very very heavily paid so we need the consumption so even though we get the drop off we email twice a day we have contextual flows plus two campaigns a day plus plus like seven days a week so that's like our model um but what have you seen I was talking to Cole about the marketplace I remember when you're doing the remote. Um, I'm blanking. Yeah, the remote integrator cuz like that was that's like the the the hat I wore for a long time. I built all the tech stack, all the CRM, you know, 5 million zaps a month. Like I did that for a long time before I went more operator and like, you know, owner vibe. So, what's the stack now with long form? Does it still go to is there a recurring engine? Do you keep that going or is it now just Yeah. So, so specifically product suite? Yeah. Just kind of like what? Yeah. What what's your main leaning into? I mean, I know you said where it is now, but what kind of sits on So, so for us, um I still have the membership site scaling school. Uh there you're right. Last year I was going really heavy into it. Um in full transparency, which like that's what I for me I one of the things I think my clients pay me for is just like for me to be the guinea pig and test stuff out and then if it works I pass on. If it doesn't I don't. And so the the MR thing was something I I was testing out for both myself and a bunch of our clients. I think the main downside of the membership site is like I didn't think enough of this in the very beginning, but it's very similar because info is like content and content's like TV shows. So that's very similar to like Netflix and so why do you keep on watching Netflix every single week? Because they come out with fullfledged like literally shows all and so I didn't really realize that that was going to be what was required. Now, I was able to get to 100K MR relatively quickly, both because of my audience size and because I have 54 classes inside of my scaling school because I have been, like we've been talking about, creating content for the past four years. So, I just packaged it up a little bit better, dressed it up, and put it inside of there. So, I got away with it for a while. But, I'm, as we've been talking a little bit, I am very much one to audit my time and my return on time. And I just felt like, okay, creating these classes like for $100,000 a month, it just wasn't it just didn't line up for what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, etc., etc. And I could only also say the same thing so many times, you know what I mean? Like, you know, Netflix has all these different producers and directors creating pretty much the same premise of a show multiple different times, you know, uh, and I was going to be a oneman show with it. So um that being said and last year uh 22% of our high ticket sales were ascensions from scaling school into the high ticket because we do an onboarding call. Um and that onboarding call like this quarter so far we're at 100% of onboarding calls into qualified sales calls. So it's it's it's like a big big driver of high ticket sales for us. So we kept it for that reason. The high ticket sales in general or 22% of the scaling school ascended? No of the high ticket sales in general. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think the ascension from scale in school is uh 13%. Something like that. Still crazy. Yeah. It's still really high. Well, you also got to think like the other thing about skill in school was I couldn't really I never really got the paid ads nailed down on the on the MR side of things because you know and I used to have the the CMO of Mind Valley as the CMO of my company. I've spoken with the CMO of um of MasterClass, you know, and they're not profitable. It's like it's it's you it's like a selling a s a software where the only way that those companies are able to scale is they get huge venturebacked capital and then they pay let's say $300 for a $100 a month member but then they get it back up in the lifetime value. But of course I'm not venturebacked so I'm paying this all out of my pocket. And of course this is the exact opposite of me spending you know a dollar and making $4 back on my high ticket paid ad side. Right? So like I could never really crack that. So the reason I say all that is because that ascension rate was higher because it was all organic. Um primarily driven by YouTube people that had been watching myself for a while but had never joined us high ticket for whatever reason. Uh I I that the one thing I'll credit with scaling school what it did for me was it really opened up my mind to what in the SAS world they call productled growth. So instead of salesled growth, which is like, okay, book a call, book a call, book a call, book a call, book a call. It's like, hey, try this product first and then if you like it, then you can maybe try one of our higher product suites or product tiers, which would be the high ticket. So that was really great because we were getting people that were like, man, I've been following your content for a while, never did anything. I came in here, I bought Scaling School, I implemented this one thing. I was like, oh my god, this is amazing. Let me go now work with you guys oneon-one. Um, and so that was why we kept it around. So that's a long way of saying scaling schools still our primary low ticket in Q1 and Q2. I tested a bunch of different low and mid-t offers, but we're kind of sunsetting those a little bit because once again, I don't think they're the best return on my time. So scaling school and then it goes to scaling with systems, which is our flagship. Um that's our primary uh program. Um that's $18,000 anywhere from 14 to $18,000 depending on payment plans. Then I have a back-end mastermind that's 40 to 50 grand called Scaling Initiative. Um that includes inerson masterminds, one-on-one times with me and my CMO, my head of sales, my client sess director, um done for you elements, etc., etc. Um I actually have my mastermind next week in Miami. Um and then the thing that we I I wanted to launch a higher ticket offer because what what's happening is in our backend mastermind, we're getting right now we have our fourth and fifth renewal for some of these people. And so my client sess director is like, "Dude, we got to find something else." Like, you know, like where we we pulled everything out, you know, like we got people coming to your house. Like we pulled everything out of the the hat that we can to like get them to renew again at the lake at the boat. Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. The boat was part of it. Yeah. We were invited like, "Oh, you um but what we that was actually one of the official formations of the holding company." Uh so now the thing above the mastermind will be the holding company where we buy equity inside of the company and then we'll help it scale um that way. So it's like okay you're not paying whatever an upfront amount of it but it's still a way that we can massively increase our lifetime value because like let's say we get one client that we're able to net like like let's say an extra 3 to four million a year from that one client. Well, then if you extrapolate that into the lifetime value of, you know, whatever whether how whichever level you're looking at, scaling with school members or scaling with systems members, that's a massive add-on on there with just one more client. So, that was the final offer that we've tacked on this year. And so, I've been working with my client SES director to kind of teach him how to do better due diligence because if there's one thing I've learned talking to a bunch of PE guys and then even a couple people in our industry that do a little bit of the holding co thing, it's it's not a numbers game. It's not like VC. you're really looking for like I would rather find two amazing companies a year to work with versus 10 because um what one thing I have learned and this is a great lesson for everybody on this call is that and I've seen it even even in businesses that we've taken on let's just say for easy numbers in in scaling with systems let's say I'm putting 10 units out of 10 in effort to make the money that we're making which probably isn't true but let's just say 10 out of 10 and these other companies because of the market the offer the industry blah blah blah I could put two out of 10 units of energy in and make the same amount of money I'm making 10 out of 10 here, which is why Herozi wrote $100 million offers first. So like that's one I'm like, okay, I'd rather just instead of working with 10 companies and all of them have to take the same amount of energy, let's just literally save ourselves for the the two to four companies we come across a year that are just unbelievably bananas and they're just printing money, but they don't know how to build a sales team or marketing team or whatever else it is. Um, and we'll just rip them that way. Yeah. No, it totally makes sense. I had uh Amed on here uh and he does he calls it black swans. He's like I will only work with black swans which is his version of you know one or two versus 10 in the trading space. So he only does it through organic. Um so he would they don't do paid ads and they have like the exact shop on how to do it. He has someone that basically shadowed him like Mr. Beast style so that could that uh could just make it so he could basically be his operator and right hand and he'll snipe these good ones and grow them large large. he doesn't say the exact name but a very large uh he was the CMO like from the jump uh with a very large guy that then went into uh SAS from trading into SAS uh which we probably all know who is but uh then went from there to having multiple of these and they do size and you can also like yeah cuz the monetization model it's it's a hybrid agency holding co equity whatever but in the end with a lot of these info coaching businesses they're never going to sell right so like equity almost just offers up like risk at some And then also profit, you know, generally would be tied to like a distribution or a profit number, which also you don't have as much control over. So a lot of these guys I've seen are doing it based on rev. So either Rev or if you're if they're paid, like Jeremy Haynes, for example, a lot of his are rev minus spend. So like gross numbers roughly. Um, and then sometimes some will bake in acquisition as an entirety. So like the 10 to 15 to 20 points of uh sales. And I'm like, so interesting. There's a lot of different models out there. The equity one's interesting because if they can't sell it like what's the upside? Well, I think I you're right. The that is one way of looking at it. Um and in full transparency, the entire portfolio I have right now is all all of them are pure cash plays. Um right. And that was also one of the things that I identified myself was like what do I really want? Blah blah blah. I don't really need like you know all if I did nothing else in my life I'll hit $100 million by the age I'm like before 50. So like that just by my investments going on right now. So like um and that's not even I'm not even including active income coming in. I'm just saying my my compounding uh investments. So it's like okay if I know that that's kind of in the bank unless I just totally [ __ ] the bed on something then um it kind of makes me look a little bit different. Okay like so what is 200 million going to do? What is 300 million going to do? And it's funny there's this really good podcast um I forgot the name of it. It's like money something. It's by Sam Parr. It's his company Hamilton and they interview these founders that are like couple hundred million dollar exits and then they walk through their personal expenses. Moneywise. I know exactly. Money wise. Moneywise. And they and they're like $100 million net worth like two three hundred million. And they're spending like they're like, "Yeah, yeah. My burn monthly burns like 15 grand, 20 grand." And it's like that's that's below my monthly burn right now. You know what I mean? So it's like like it just showed me that I I don't need more money to be living the life that I want to live. So that's all to say that I kind of was like, okay, I could try to find these companies that have a lot of enterprise value, but there's also a lot of downside to trying to building those companies up compared to maybe cash flow plays. Um, and so like we said, I we'll do $30 million this year. And so I've been very profitable, very cash flow heavy, and it's given me instead of having to sacrifice five or 10 years of my life and then make $30 million, I've just made that money along the way and enjoying my life the entire time. So I was like, well, let's just do that business model. And um and and so we're we also look for creator first brands that are maybe creators amazing at capturing attention but don't know how to package the offer up into something incredibly high ticket and don't know how to build sales systems, marketing systems. Like my fiance is a great example. Like we're able to almost pack a salesperson's calendar with incredibly qualified people for this matchmaking offer and it's a 28k offer and these guys are dudes with jets and like it's it's nuts um what she's able to get from just her Instagram reels that she has there. But the reason I say all of that is that um the equity aspect of it to me have after having done with this a few times, I like it for a few. Number one, it does give you a little bit more um protection of the number one thing that we all know that happens is someone comes to you at 50 grand a month, you get them to $5 $100,000 a month, and then they decide they don't want you anymore. You know what I mean? So that that's probably the number one thing I like about equity because I have done that multiple times and they're like, "Okay, cool. Well, we'll just terminate the contract and like take and then sure, you could try to whatever, but it just never works out that way. So, I like equity for that sake. Um, and then also for decision-m power and voting rights. It's like, okay, I've done I've done portfolio companies where I had minority and there was two other founders and it was like, okay, let's make this decision today and and like the founders wanted to meet up in person and have the conversation and like, you know, and what I would have done in one day took three weeks to do, you know, and and if you extrapolate that every single decision across the thing. So I try to do equity for typically to try to make some decision getting some kind of voting rights inside the company but also to protect my downside if I invest heavily into the team and structure of this company and we scale it that they can't just walk away and leave and do it on their own. Yeah, the downside one's big. I've had this conversation a lot because it's like what's the it's a monetization model, right? It's like you're you can it's consulting for equity, it's consulting for revshare, it's consulting for deployment or whatever level of service then whatever level of monetization. And this conversation happens a lot. I went to a London event the now consulting.com quantum but um was Iman's 8 figureure license and I went out there and this was like a 4 a.m. conversation for two hours these guys were going on about this on different ways uh the and I just saw Will uh Rivera post about this about almost making it like a record label style where you're like fronting cash instead. So you're doing like as like a hedge and protection which still is not super protected in comparison to equity but like basically where you're like fronting forward and you're like cool they're doing 200 grand a month I'm going to take them to a million a month come up with the math on like you're fronting them cash because you're really like backing the person which you are no matter what you know through the whole process if they're creator led you're backing the person anyway and I was like oh that's an interesting idea but yeah a lot a lot of different models and ways to cut that and that's kind of like my vision of where I'm going to go within this we have a very like paid paid heavy um not as high margin version of info coaching. So like we still deliver through info coaching but you know we did 30 last year and we're like hammering into it trying to get to 100 and very paid heavy now trying to build out like this big suite like this whole thing but you know 120 140 people but 120 employee like it's just so it's so like attractive to me to do these different versions and I want to stay in info coaching and not go off and be like private equity or software like you know how everyone climbs up makes all their cash and then dips. I'm like why not stay right here in the honeypot? I can talk up and down and back and forth about, you know, this industry. Um, but yeah, I think a lot of people also leave as well because I think that they feel embarrassed um by how easy the money I watched a YouTube video the other day with this guy was like, it's not a real business and I'm like, I need to challenge myself like, you know, whatever. Everybody does whatever the hell they want to do. Like, I'm I'm totally cool with it. But, um, the one thing I will do always before I make any decisions, any major decisions, is I will interview 20 or 30 people that have done that exact same thing. So a great example is before I and proposed to my fiance I talked to 20 or 30 entrepreneurs about do you regret getting married like good marriages bad marriages like so it's just like the shortcut mentoring thing you know but nice thing is with with my brand I can typically make a story and then get on some calls really quickly so I've done that for everything and I actually at the beginning of this year I was thinking about transitioning fully into private equity and um and doing the thing where I go work with these brick-andmortar companies I get a potentially we grow them I get a percentage of what they called Carrie the 2 and 20 when they exit in 5 to 8 years and so like I had this whole thing mapped to my head also with the help of ChachiBT I was in Japan like literally I had like a whole life revelation and um and I was like this is what I'm going to do and then I talked to these 20 PE guys and I'm really fortunate where I live in Miami on this island there's a bunch of PE and VC guys there so like I would talk to them at the pool and like I would run them through the numbers of what we were doing and how much I was working and they were like dude you're you're going [ __ ] backwards right what are you like what are you what are you doing like he's like you're you should just be doing more of what you're currently doing and like taking home this guy and I talked to this one dude who lives on my island and he's probably worth like $200 $300 million and he's like dude the bottom line is cash is king and exactly what I said to you earlier it's like okay you could wait and you okay maybe in in 5 years you could make $20 million net or you could just make $5 million a year net for five years like u or four years or whatever um and maybe and maybe have a higher quality of life And so they were all kind of like I I literally every single one of them was like I think this is not the right move. And so I decided okay instead of doing the private equity where I go work at these brick and mortars I still like the leverage that private equity and stuff gives you. And so that's why I kind of decided to do the holding co thing instead and and leverage it that way. But we're just primarily focusing on info and consulting businesses because um like you said it's it's I'm an expert at it. You and I could talk about it literally all day long. I've seen every problem thousands of times already again. So I can solve it in like an instant. And that's how I can see this company, we can start working together and hit half a million dollars a month within the first 60 days. And realistically in my and I feel like I've almost put no effort inside of it, right? Because it's just you've done it so many times. So So why would I go back and start from zero? And maybe I'll maybe I'll regret this and I'll bite my words and I'll later on I'll be like, whatever, you were so naive. But I I'm just at the stage in my life where I want to prioritize um I just like I I like to prioritize living and I don't there's no at this point there's no like let me sacrifice now for a future great date because I just know that that's almost always monetary tied and I can't really think of like that Japan trip I'll just be really transparent. I think we spent 35 or $40,000 uh on the Japan trip and like other than flying private between the islands in Japan, there's literally nothing else I think that we could have done. And you could do spend a 40 grand vacation making a couple of million dollars a year. You don't need to make a hund00 million a year to do that. So, some of these things are all realizations I'm doing like as I've been going through my life. Yeah. No, that's uh the decision- making and this is what Cole had said when we were on like where did that come from or like where he his example was his example was talking about like apartments you're looking at you're like oh yeah well like it went through these like this and this yeah my assistant already did like 15 the 15 point checklist so I don't even see these 120 of them and then you know I see only these five and then I get there but like even how you're talking about interviewing like I'm trying right how to understand what I need to build towards an exit. Like we our whole goal is like we want to hit exit velocity in info coaching. So there's we have other plays that are going to be in we're in fitness. So like there's supplement plays, there's now like the peptides, the tele medicine game, there's recurring like info, but then there's onetoone high ticket. There's like all these different things and it's like what are important parts and pieces? So I'm like should I get on one of those websites and pay a,000 bucks an hour to talk to some private equity person? Should I get some fractional someone? Um, I got on with Roland Frasier. He's got consulting for equity, which means I'm sure he's going to want some chunk if I do do it. But like he's, you know, he has the 90-day offer that's XYZ high ticket to do basically the initial combo. Um, but like where did that come from? Like how do you I mean I see how you approach things, but who makes the initial SOP? Who makes the like It's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy with everything. It's an interesting question. Yeah. And and it's so funny you bring up Cole. He's hilarious, dude. He's like like when when he was thinking of moving to Miami and uh I was showing him my condo and he was like, "Dude, I love it here. I love it here." And he was like I was like, "Yeah, I I've already done a bunch of research. I looked at he's like he's like, "I'm not even going to look anywhere else because I know that you've already researched every single place in Miami, so I would just move right here in the same building." Yeah. Give me your top three. Yeah. He's he it's he's And same thing like I have this walkie treadmill in my office. He's like he just came in my office, took a video and bought like all the stuff that I had bought inside of there. It's already out. That's what I love about Cole. He's like he has no ego. He's just like, "All right, if this is the best, like just throw me." Um, that's been a great relationship I've developed over the past couple years. I'm glad he introduced us, but huge shout out to Cole Gordon. He's an awesome awesome dude. But, um, yeah, I don't know. The decision-m thing, I don't really know. I think in all honesty, like when I think of things that are like, okay, so let's just say it's a habit at this point, right? I'm a big first principles guy. So, the the systems and decision-m and like, okay, measure twice or 10 times before you cut once. Like those all have to be habits. And so if you don't if I don't get it ingrained from my parents and being grown up, which I don't, then it has to be something else that like continued to positively give me a feedback whenever I did that thing. And so that would could convince me to keep on doing it over and over again. And so honest to God, if I had to like narrow it down to one thing, I think what happened was um there was one point very early on in my business career where uh there's two main instances. one where I was making almost no money and the other when I was making good money, let's say like 100 grand a month, uh but I was working like 80 90 hours a week and I hated my life. It was like I had just it was to me it was the same thing as making no money because I just wasn't really like I wasn't able to enjoy anything. And so in both those instances I actually just read the same book twice which was the 4-hour work week. Um so this is 2018 2019 and in both times it totally changed my life. The first time when I had no money, it was getting a VA to do cold email for me for real estate agents. And then I was only taking sales calls and like that exploded our business. And then the other time it was like starting to build um automations and hiring VAS to do fulfillment and simplifying our our backend. So instead of doing email and SMS and websites and funnels and ads, we would just do an instant format for these real estate agents and I could set it up in 5 minutes. Um and so both of those instances then totally transformed my life. The first one, me actually starting to make some money online. And the second one was when I I actually sold all my stuff, ironically, in the same town that I just bought this house in. Um, and I moved uh to South America for a couple of months. Then I moved to Europe. Then I moved and ended up in San Diego um where I lived before I moved back down to Miami. And so like it I was really working the four I was really living the 4-hour work week lifestyle there. And I was like only working a couple hours a week. So I think that just for me the simplest way to put it is um I know that whenever I build a system for something I typically never have to deal with that problem ever again in my life. And so I almost like to just try to make my life as free of problems. Obviously that sounds cheesy but as humanly possible. And so it would just bo it just boggles my mind why somebody wouldn't build it like okay you let's say a great example I have um I probably take 80 to 100 vitamins every single day. So I hired somebody to come over here to to segregate out the vitamins that I need to take in this little vitamin thing that I have so I don't have to deal with it on a daily basis because I know I need to take those and I hated Sunday nights spending like 30 minutes pulling out these vitamins. So, even I have to pay somebody $50 to come in here and do it, like that's even if I wasn't working during that time, it's a better use of my time just to be sitting on the couch and reading or relaxing than for me to be doing that. Um, and the the second element of the systems thing for me is um I like people I think make decisions so quickly on things like let's say that private equity thing or jumping niches or whatever else it is without interviewing people. Um, and so I just know that the quality of your life is almost directly proportional to the quality decisions that you're making. And so if I can make sure that I have as much information as possible before I make that decision, then I could arguably have a better quality life than somebody else because I have more information than other person does. Um, and so I think it can be a little bit of a um of a it can hurt me a little bit. Like I like I bought a boat here recently and I would probably not be oversetting if I said I spent 30 working hours trying to figure out which boat that I wanted to buy here. You know what I mean? But I also know that I'm going to have that boat for a couple years and I want it to be like the perfect boat for me. So it sometimes tilts over that way. But yeah, I just strongly believe that the your life is determined by your decisions and the decisions you make is typically determined by how much information you have. And so I just try to get as much information, quality information as as I can before I make the decisions, which luckily now AI and chatb it does a lot of the heavy lifting for me or will at least do the heavy lifting for my team members that they need before they present it to me, etc., etc. Yeah. No, it's amazing. I've learned so much from you on this and I clearly have so much more to learn about this um like from you like because if I look at it as Dan's Dan Martell, right, the buyback your time, it's like this idea four-hour work week. I've read it. I can't even tell you how many times like that idea around things, but I took the tech piece of it and just went triple down on that. Like I said, 5 million zaps. Like I didn't have a marketing nut. I didn't have a marketing tech until 6 weeks ago doing 30 million a year. Like I was still doing the marketing tech piece on like buildouts. But then again, we rammed like 71 million through one call funnel. So it's like there wasn't a ton of intensive builds, but my whole thing was like build it, structure it, a little bit of duct tape, but a lot of rounds of duct tape because they can scale heavy just it's more apps and cheats and whatever. And then finally like took a breath, zoomed out was like okay, we need like a data person, we need like a source of truth, we need, you know, a marketing, we need like these different pieces and now we're moving that direction. But like I still like personal wise, I have no EA. I just hired a project manager that started yesterday which is like my version of ops because right now I'm like okay now the biggest lever is marketing but like team efficiency through marketing which then turns into CPA efficiency right it's like so both buckets are cash burn that could have much higher return on so I'm like okay I need project management I'm gonna initially deploy them in marketing but you know she has the experience and training caliber that she can go cross company and worked in a team with 140 prior like right before this I'm like okay perfect But in a personal life, you do it in all these ways. I definitely use like chat aggressively. I definitely use some of these things. I think like that, but I don't like build systems to then replace it. So, I get kind of like caught back in that same loop. But, I've never had an EA, for example. I've never had like my business, you got to get an EA, dude. My business manager has a house manager and she does like the supplements. Like, he opens his fridge and it's like the water's perfect. Like the pro the RTD protein shakes are perfect and like he's got his meals. I'm like, "Oh, like I'll order meal prep that delivers to the door and I'll do this and this and just have Amazon auto deliveries." And I'm like, "That's my version." But like it's automation. Yeah. Yeah. There's But there's always like there's always the reason why you'll like and I won't say never, but like the reason why I still think people are so afraid of losing their jobs to AI, but there's always stuff that slips between the cracks and there's always the person that you need to run the AI thing. So like for example, my assistant might ask me um like, "Oh, how do I do this thing?" And I now I just say just ask chat GPT that's it's like the answer for every single thing especially we're buying all this stuff for this new house but the things will always slip through the cracks and uh I don't know I think it's just because I think about it all the time. I'm just so keenly aware like when I'm doing the vitamin thing when I was doing that for the like couple of weeks I did it when I first got this health coach and I was doing this every time I did it I was like this is such a waste of my time but like you know the person current person I have right now I don't think I could trust them to do this accurately so I had to hire somebody else. Um, and so like, but it's all it's all leverage. It's typically front-loaded. So, it's like, okay, let's just say for easy numbers, whatever. You have you're spending 10 hours a week doing [ __ ] that you shouldn't be doing because you could have a personal assistant do it. Um, and so you're just justifying like, oh, I automated I blah blah, every once in a while a hiccup comes up, so like I can just handle it there. But then if you just frontloaded like two weeks, let's say 20 hours, you could probably find, interview, hire, and onboard that personal assistant in those 20 hours. And then they could take care of this. And then any growing thing that you're doing like you're probably and I don't want to project on you Ryan so this might not be true but but at least for me like at least so I'll give you a great example. This house that we just moved into there's a we're doing like a bunch of [ __ ] I built a custom sauna out here like we're building new dock like a bunch of stuff inside the house. So like all of this stuff that's happening there's just absolutely no way I would do that if I didn't have an assistant. She's living at this house here with me right now executing on all these tasks. She's coordinating with the landscaper. We're getting pravel everywhere. She's coordinating with the handyman to fix these doors, the electrician uh for these lights. Like, so there's like 17 different vendors she's talking to. And so we're 2 weeks into this house and like it already looks like we've lived here for 5 years, right? And and so the only other option would have been I moved here and either a I lived in a house that was below what I would consider my standards. it wouldn't have been there and I would have just maybe done a project here or there when I ever I found time time which is typically what I see most entrepreneurs will do. They just don't live the life that they really could live because they know that they can't take on more projects cuz they physically don't have time or B I'll have to sacrifice my business and the growth of my business and folks spend that time that I I should be working on a business building a [ __ ] fire pit or something inside of here or like you know doing whatever else it is. So, like most of the time what I found is a lot of entrepreneurs before they have an EA and I once again I don't know you well enough but they they typically will just settle for like okay this is cool like like uh the meal thing like I used to get meal prep too until I was like I had somebody cook me a meal at my house my assistant and I was like oh my god this is 100 times better also it doesn't have seed oils it can have some variation inside of it like and so I was like okay well I'm not going to do meal prep ever again and Um, so yeah, I just feel like there could, especially at your level, dude, like it'd just be so funny how much not only you could take off your plate that you're doing right now, but how much more could you do that you're not currently doing? Um, or even for your wife, right? I think you're you're married, correct? Uh, girlfriend. Okay. So, even with your girlfriend, like, you know, what could you surprise her with? What could they take off of her plate? Whatever else it is by having um either an EA or a PA. But my only recommendation would be if you can try to get it in person. That's that's a big game changer, too. Yeah. I know. And I'm talking about moving. So like in the more recent time, I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to wait then until I move." I was at my dinner with my dad. He's like, "Dude, stop nickel and dimeming. Like you can overlap on you can overlap by a month and you know $2,500 spread." I'm like, "Yeah, you're probably right. You're probably right." Are you moving to a different city or to the talking I'm talking about Scottsdale right now. I did the Puerto Rico thing for the last three years. So I was down there. Were you there right now? No, it's just like super isolating and it just kind of got to a point. I was living a different lifestyle, too, in all fairness. like I was partying like a rockstar like having being all over the board and then like I was in I wasn't in Dorado life. I was in like San Juan area and I had a couple friends that were like lead genen guys and kind of in the space but in the end we were all the guys who were on our computer all day and then the random times we'd come and connect would be like hit it hard type and like that model. So I completely cut that like that part of my life out and then I was down there and then it was extremely isolating right because I was like not doing that stuff or that. So, moved back to where I'm from. Um, which is where, you know, friends, fam, girlfriends, stuff like that. It's all good, but it's it's, you know, I talk about kind of not a bad way, but like lowering how I was kind of living, right? It was the glass boxes and it was all over all these places and now it's like, you know, I'm in like a little townhouse and wherever and I'm like, "Okay, I got I got to get out of here." So, went through a winter again. Never had winter in years. So, yeah, it's time to move. So, I'm looking at Scottsdale, Florida or Miami. I just went to Jeremy Hans's event there. like it's cool, but also like kind of quick trigger I I could see I guess anywhere you are including Scottsdale, but like it's easy to fall under these different buckets like the lifestyle and the type of people that are there. So without having quality people, I also have half my family out in Scottsdale, so it's kind of like an easy Oh, cool. middle push to like double whammy that I've always wanted the Michigan summers, the lake, the all that vibe and then somewhere warm during winter because I just won't do that anymore. So I got to dance that line. So that's a that leads to a good question cuz I would identify myself I would say or when I look at you it's almost like you escaped the entrepreneur grind rat race work work 80 hours I need to be doing things all the time and you went out into like you said obviously not you know 4-hour work week only maybe sometimes of your life but like in these mode but that other time you still have the same amount of hours you still have all that and I would identify as me individually like I don't like to go see the waterfall. I don't like to go on like the like that's just not and maybe it's a false belief or maybe but like I really don't thus far enjoy it that I know or maybe I've just framed myself in a way to do that like where it's like that's not as exciting as me being in a laptop in a coffee shop. Even when I'm like in Bali, I don't leave the mile. I go there and I work and I have fun and like I like the weather and I like where I'm at. But that's why I optimize having like really high quality living spaces because I don't leave. Like I just work in my spot and I go to my gym and I do my thing and like I have my little routine no matter where I am. So like what do you do with all the time? The the buy back your time is like or the hormone is like you know replace yourself and then do higher leverage and you're constantly doing higher leverage higher leverage and not like like taking the break in the air. But it seems as if you have found like the things that enjoy you or that that you enjoy, right? That that are your mode, right? the boat, the trips, like you said, going to Japan and doing all that like kind of sounds fun, but again, not really my speed on like what I want to go taste all these things or like go see all this stuff. So, that's where I kind of struggle with that, too. Yeah, it's it's honestly a really good point. And I think that it's almost like a little bit, you're kind of right, it's almost it's so funny. There's like, oh, you're Matrix, red pill, like you know, you're working 9 to5, blah, blah, blah. But no one really talks about there's also an entrepreneurial side of that as well. Um, and I just want to be totally clear when I say all this that I totally respect one of my best friends in the world is a [ __ ] workhorse. We'll go like literally I I went to the snowboarding trip with him and he went on the mountain for one run one time and the rest of the time he was literally working at his computer and I'm like, you know, I have no knock with that. And he's happy. He, you know, for me I would never travel all the way over here and like, you know, do one run and and work. But like you you're just like you. That's what you want. And I know he's done what I'm about to say, but I think that what most people do is they fall in this glitch, this mimetic thing where it's like, oh well, because this other person said I need to be grinding all the time and and I need to be grinding all the time and because that's what I that's what I want. And I think the problem is like from the moment we are born for the rest of our lives, we are being literally I you know I am hesitant to use the word brainwashed but we are being inundated with other people's expectations of what we should do, what we should enjoy, what we shouldn't do, what we shouldn't enjoy. And I just feel like not enough people actually isolate and sit down for a long enough period of time consistently enough and identify what do I actually want? Not my mom, not society. what the entrepreneur community whole not my ego, right? Like even right now we're like, "Oh man, I would love to maybe move to this area full-time cuz I just I love who I am here." So, but I'm like, "Oh, but I'm known as the Miami guy." Like I can I literally can identify my ego being like, "Oh, you're softening up. You're not playing the game as hard. People aren't going to look up to you because you're not like living the Miami lifestyle." Like I I can I'm thinking of it and like I even have conversations with Chat GBT about it, but I I know enough of like what first principles I truly do value and enjoy. And the truth is, it's almost ironic a little bit, but you have to take that time and not be working the 60 to 80 hours a week to even lift your head up long enough to identify what do you truly truly want. And it maybe it is working 68 hours a week, but that's the first step that most people don't even do. Um, and what I did that really helped was creating I call it my life manifesto. Uh you might have heard me talk about that or not, but like that was really that was two years ago and that was when I really painted the life that I wanted and I nailed down it was like me speaking in future pace three years from now and I actually read it out loud and you can even see on my YouTube channel the time stamp and all the things coming true. Yeah. So like you know and that that gets a little bit into universal stuff which I won't talk about now. But the point being that I was like okay cool. This is what I want. and I'm going to cut off anything else outside of this and then I'm going to see in one year, two years, 3 years if this is still what I want or maybe it changes from there. And so I just don't think enough people create the space that need to to figure out what they truly enjoy. And then once they do figure out what they truly enjoy, I think it does take courage, especially if it's against the grain. And also like I know I could be making more money right now if I was working harder. Like there's just no doubt about it that I could be like maybe two times the income if I work two times as hard. So to go against the the main predominant society which is like more money is is what everyone should go through. Um it's really it takes courage and I know that sounds weird to say like not working hard takes courage but I think it does as long as you're doing it mostly to because it's what you align with. And if anyone hasn't listen hasn't listened to Naval Ravocon or read the almanac I think that's like that's one of the people that I look up to probably the most in this world. Um because I think he's nailed it so hard. or he said the point of playing the game is to no longer have to play the game. And so I'm kind of at that now. And so I don't want to play stupid games and win stupid prizes. So yeah, I say all that to say that I think that what helps is sitting down and identifying what you actually want uh not uh outside of your ego and then just testing it out. And so what I found for me was that I prioritized more than anything else um what I value more than anything else is quality time with quality people. That's like I know that sounds cheesy but if I had first principles it's literally I like to be around really great people. I like to learn from them. I like to laugh with them with them etc etc. And so a great example is I used to have a plane um and I have my pilot's license and I would travel everywhere with my fiance. We put a couple hundred hours on it in two years and I ended up selling it and moving into a house on the water and buying a boat because the boat was more conducive to activities with friends and stuff like that. And so on a Wednesday instead of working, I might invite everybody out for an afternoon cruise on the boat. And you know, sometimes it's hard finding friends that are are also not falling into this like working 68 hours a week. But I I I sit there and like we're all laughing and like sometimes I'll look at my fiance and I at the same time. We'll just kind of catch each other being like like we created this and this is like we love this so much. Um and so because that I we love that moment. That's the feedback loop to be like, "Okay, what else can we do?" So, this house that I bought here in in Greatton Beach, Florida, this lake house, everything that I'm building, this custom sauna for eight people, the boats for eight people, like the couches for eight people, like I'm buying it so that I can also invite all of my friends from Miami or, you know, around the world to come stay with me here cuz I know I I value that more than anything else. Um, and so yeah, it's it's a little bit about figuring out what you want and then you might not even know if that's true, going out and testing it. And then maybe it's like you and you truly do just like to work on a computer or somewhere, but you want to do it beautifully, then there's also nothing wrong with that. There's no shame in that. I just feel like most people um just do it totally subconsciously. They'll live their entire life like that. Um and as a final note, I'll say, I know that I'm ranting a little bit here. The the the day that it really really hit home for me is um my first large event, I made $1.4 million in in a day pitching from stage. And I remember I did that and um I just felt nothing afterwards. It was like I I just realized that my life didn't change one iota. You know, my team's like freaking out. That was our first big event. Like it was like it was this huge deal and I was just like, didn't even nothing changed for me. Even that night and the next morning and I was just like, "Wow, I'm really glad I realized this right now versus me trying to do what we've been saying here so far. You know what? let me get out of info so I can get in SAS so that I can have a $100 million exit so I can sacrifice the next four to five years so that I can be and then I I do that and then I'm in the that's why I like that moneywise podcast. That's why I like interviewing people that have made that kind of money because you kind of start to realize like, okay, I'm at the point now where I have escape velocity. So, I could outside of flying private everywhere I want to go. Like, I could pretty much do anything that I want to do right now. And so, before I dive into something that's just more of what the same or more of whatever anybody wants, let me take some time to figure out what I actually truly enjoy. Yeah, there's so much gold in that. That was like Yeah, that was a huge rant. I'm sorry about that. So good. Like the almanac, that's probably my most gifted book. Uh, oh, that's awesome. Is the almanac and it's only like four or five gifts, but I don't gift things often and that's definitely one of them. The It's so funny that going to a mountain like I've gone to Aspen, flown in and literally like and I never hit anything like I never even like rented. I never I just sat there and mine used to be partying. That used to be like my like reason for it cuz it was it was the social part of it but that was like what got me in the zone of like being social. So I would go to these crazy I would either work work there or when I wasn't it was like oh what are we doing? where are we going? Who's everyone that's there? And it like it got like destructive levels like we hit it hard and then the money was involved in this stuff and I was like yeah I just don't need this in my life. Like there's there's more cons than pros and like many away and I was like so I'm not doing that. So when I pulled that away it became what is there still and it was just okay the work filled that void. So I'm like there's some there's some uh play in that between Yeah. But Ovens was the first one like OG days that I I think his was called morning formula I think it was at the time or maybe that was Welch or one of those guys like all of them have it at some level but what is my you know manifesto or formula or or future vision and I wrote one out back then and like to this day like you can see clear as day like I I followed this thread and then like it because I didn't update it. it broke and like I I I have this portion of it and then I was like oh cool I just didn't go that direction with things which is good but like I don't update that which is a very um very updating is a key key part like I started not getting motivated reading my manifesto and and then I asked chatbt because that's like my first thing anytime I have a question and like and it's like well you got you already you've already crushed like 80% of this so like you know you need so then I was like all right well let me do something crazy let me say I'm going to buy a lakehouse in my hometown in this and lake that houses sell once every 25 years. Within six weeks of that, my buddy who's an agent here text me and was like, "Yo, this house is about to go on market. I know you had mentioned that you might want to get a place here." And we ended up closing in 30 days. So, it's like it's it's like by updating it. You just got to be careful what you put on there because that [ __ ] will come true. Yeah. Yeah. That [ __ ] will come true. So, you got to be like like I told my fiance like, "Are we going to move here full-time?" Like literally, we found our dream house in Miami in September of last year. Everything's perfect about it. Couldn't be any better. and we're like, we could probably live here the rest of our lives. Like, we'll buy the house here. Like, this is so amazing. And that was on the manifesto before, like, get this dream house and have a boat in front of it. And so then I updated, put it here. And now, like, within 30 days, now we're like, should we just move here full-time? So, [ __ ] just changes so fast. So, you do have to be careful what you ask from the universe for that stuff. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. So, I'm super curious. So, like relationship dynamic wise and all that. Like I've heard your content like I said you Dan are like the two main ones that I see that kind of talk about it or that from an outside perspective that I would model towards um and when I went in this mode like I was 99% there and like 1% I was doing the video a day I have main co and then I have some like quiet co thing right that like no joke because I was scattered because there's no EA because I'm trying to manage all three and they happen and and you know three slack channel like all of that's happening all day it got messy it got like It would be 8:00 p.m. and I'd be like, "Oh, I didn't do my video for the day." And like, "Oh, because I didn't do my 5:00 a.m. and I broke structure, I have to do it at 8:00 p.m. and like date nights are going out the window and these things and like not hanging out with friends and was not good." Uh, so I like switched the script on it, kind of like put more in focus. But how does that dynamic work, you know, in in your world? Like I've seen you talk about planning together. I've seen you talk about I mean again whether this is friends whether this is a partner whether this is family it's like you know it's the people in your life that are outside of work right is what you kind of bucket it as so in yours I've heard you again talk about where you do like monthly plans together you talk about the big vision stuff what like out three years out 20 years like how does that look yeah I I guess it all started or it starts with finding somebody like so the main reason why people don't in my opinion prioritize relationships is because they just haven't had a great relationship yet, like an effortless one, one that makes you want to be a better person. And I was having this conversation with my fiance literally yesterday. When I say makes you want to be a better person, it's not that it makes you want to be their version of a better person, cuz I would never want that. I want to be a better person of myself. Um, because that's also who this person is attracted to, hopefully. Um, and so like all of my previous relationships were very draining, very me trying to push this person to try to be somebody else, maybe even that they weren't. Um, that they they they didn't want to be, but it was who I wanted. Um, I I also see dating very much like employees in the sense that like, you know, like try to find somebody's batteries and Yeah. Yeah. Exa Exactly. Literally, exactly. And also try to find somebody batteries included as Herozi would say. Meaning like don't try to hire someone that you want to change into the person that you want to do because just understand that the person that you meet that same day. There's a greater chance than anything that is exactly who they're going to be in 30 years when you guys are married together. So like like I also learned that big lesson as well, which I'm fortunate of. And so like find somebody who already is the person that you want to be with long term and it'll the relationship it will be way easier, way less uh energy. Um, and it'll be really for me it's energy giving, which I think Dan does a really good job at talking about things that give you energy, things that take away energy. And and a really good relationship is energy giving. And you know, I'll just be really radically transparent. I haven't had a relationship with my dad for the past three and a half years. I haven't spoken with him one time. We've always had a rocking relationship. And I I actually turned I cut that relationship off in my life because that was very energy draining for me. And I I eventually needed to start to be really ruthless with my energy and how I did it. And so I think that um if you are able to step one find somebody who's energy giving then everything else is just so much easier. It's like it's like yes I can I definitely could talk about the sinks and the the manifestos and and all that stuff but it's just like all that stuff is so so easy and I'm like you know if you tell me to like let's say we actually funny enough I'm celebrating 5 years with my fiance tomorrow. So like let's say 7 years ago you would have been like yeah you need to meet at with your girlfriend at the time every single two weeks and talk about the relationship blah blah blah. I would have probably been like hell no absolutely not like there's no way you know what I mean but now I like look forward to it and once again it has nothing to do with my previous partners. It was more like me and who I was attracting who I I was trying to have them be somebody that I didn't that they didn't want to be. But um so that's the first thing. And then I think the main thing that I noticed because I I actually do get to see this unique side because the reason why my fiance has she has two offers. It's a double-sided marketplace, right? Like Cole and Setters and placing setters, it is she coaches women in a in a in a offer called irresistible. So, how to become an irresistible woman to attract a really highquality man. And then she has this matchmaking offer where then she potentially places those women with these highquality men that are entrepreneurs and that want a woman that really understands the entrepreneur lifestyle etc etc. So it's like very similar to Cole's thing or even my remote integrator academy train integrators place them. So like that that was one of the things I took to her business is like I was like we should two-side marketplace this thing. So, I actually have this really cool insight of because I'm a partner in that company of like the the female version, what they're wanting and and expecting and the male version uh what they want to expect. And um and so I say all that to say that finding the right person before you do anything else is the most important. And second of all, um that if you're also struggling with that right now, that you are not alone. That there's a lot a lot of and I'll just talk to the men here. There's a lot of men who are trying to find this right woman who haven't found them yet. Um, but I could the only thing I will say is that don't wait too long because the majority of clients that we're working with, they're like in their late 40s. Um, I would say like and and they regret not doing this process way way sooner. And so I just think that once again because you haven't spent the time to find the right person or put yourself in the situation to find the right person, you feel like women are a distraction. And so because you think a women are distraction, the thing that is giving you validation right now is the business and the money you're making from the business. So you'll keep on spending more time in the business and not enough time with relationships. And that will continue to happen until you potentially, I'm not going to speak for everybody here, lift your head up in 5, 10, 15 years. You've made all of this money, but now you have nobody to share this money with. You know, uh the way that I say in the marketing letter for our video sales letter for the men is uh you're a king with no kingdom or you're a king with no queen. You know what I and it's like you have nobody to share this huge empire that you build and now you're trying to find this person, but now you're at a bunch of disadvantages because you haven't been really working on others for the past year. So, um I think it's something that I think a lot of people should definitely speak more about. And um the thing that I think really helps my fiance and I is communication. Like I that's just the thing that I think it it's so cheesy and it's simple, but that that's all those meetings are the two main things that you mentioned, the bi-weekly meetings and the manifesto reading. So every two weeks we have a meeting. I follow an agenda. It follows if anybody knows the EOS framework. It follows that exact same framework. We introduce uh we share one quick win. We recognize the other person for doing the segue. Exactly. We re we review KPIs. We look at the bank accounts. like it's like I've literally followed that. It's an ASA task. I think I have a YouTube video on it. Um and then the other thing that we'll do is we read each other's life manifestos and I mostly do that um to make sure to see if there's anything that I can do to more become the man that she wants to have in her life that she's talking about in her life manifesto. Um as long as that's still in line with who I want to be. So I'm not going to be somebody that I don't want to be. That's just spot. I don't care who it's for. Nobody in my life is going to make me be something I don't want to be. But the the nice thing is that it is who I want to be. And so it's just like I'll give you a great example like two weeks ago we read the manifesto together and in that she says like you know my husband randomly surprises me with things not to hold score but just because he loves me and like after we read that later on I went out and got her flowers and I and I brought it there you know and like I just forgot like I just needed to do that and it was like a nice little gentle reminder for that and so it was a way that she could kind of communicate to me what was important without her being like why aren't you getting me flowers you know it was like this way of like this is what I would really love my future husband to do and if I want to be her future husband and I want her to be in love with me. It was like, okay, I can do that task right there. So, yeah, communication is a huge key. And the final thing I'll say on the rant, which I just feel like I've been ranting on this whole thing, sorry, but um the final thing I'll say is um I think a lot of people say, yeah, when you when you right now, cuz I I have messages all the time from clients as well, like, I don't know if this is the right one. Like, she's asking me if we should get married, blah blah blah. And I always tell the same story when Lauren I first met Lauren and she says it's in her content. I said, "Hey baby, this is how it's going to go. Number one priority, it's me. Number two priority, it's my business and you're number three priority." So that was the first thing I told her cuz that's how I told every other woman I'd ever been with cuz I was very much heads down, build the business, blah blah blah. Um, now it's no doubt about it. It's still first priority me, but it's definitely her before the business. There's no doubt about it. Um, and so I she was like, I want to get married. I want to have kids. And I was like, yeah. um you're you're in the wrong relationship for that. That's not going to happen for me. For some luck of God, she decided to stay with me even though I had said that. Like our anniversary tomorrow is not the anniversary of when I asked her to be my girlfriend because I never asked her to be my girlfriend because I was so I the only the anniversary is for 6 months in a relationship when I just turned to her and I said I love you for the first time. Like there was there was no let's work boyfriend and girlfriend. I just turned and said I love you and that's what we consider to be our anniversary. So, the thing I'll say is like, you know, I didn't know in the very beginning. It wasn't like I it was it was love at first sight and this person's be the person that I want to marry. Um, it was like it was a gradual process. And then what happened was I um I wrote my life manifesto um in uh September 2 years ago. Um yeah, two years ago. And I figured out what exactly do I want out of my life? And I that was the point in time that I realized I actually do want to be married cuz I was subscribing to everybody else that was like, "Oh, marriage is a trap and like you know you don't you can't be successful and be married blah blah blah." And then I realized no no I actually do want a marriage. It was just I was listening to what other people had told me that you can't be a successful entrepreneur and have a marriage. And within 12 months I proposed to her. You know what I mean? Like so it was like I had to figure out what I truly wanted. The right woman was already in my life. Um and I just need to actually figure out is this something that I actually want? And that was what um was one of the leading factors for me proposing. Yeah. No, I love that. I think the and even what you just said like the the growth charts is sometimes what kind of like hangs me up because you know how fast you grow and then you know when you have two people that are like that in the growth charts sometimes they are like up and to the right together but sometimes they're like going like this or could go like that and if you don't have the touch points you don't have the continuation and changing of a manifesto of what you're working towards in that growth. It's I feel like it's very easy to go like this. Um, and like casting that casting that. And I think I've been I was joking about like when I was in the YouTube videos. I'm like I'm a cog in a wheel. Like I like I made I made this machine and now I'm just like in it just working but I'm like this like I have not like zoomed out taken a look at it and been like what can I do here? Um, so no I I I prescribe that a ton. So what's what's next? What's next in the manifesto now? You hit this, you hit that. The business is is cruising along. Yeah, I love the idea of the, you know, consulting for equity slash whatever offering you would call that, you know, holdings. Um, but what's kind of next in there? I know we're going up on already have an hour, so we can wrap soon if we Yeah. Yeah. I It's cool. I have some time. Um, what's next? Yeah, I have So, first of all, I have to update my manifesto because like I you know, I haven't yet. Yeah. And so, that's what that and that's what's also funny. By the way, I wrote that manifesto and I gave myself 3 years on the original one. within 12 months I had done 85% of it right that's just and we all know that like you need to dream bigger but for me I was like oh a Miami uh house on the beach and on the bay and a boat and like you know and I was like boom boom boom boom I'm engaged like so it is funny how fast life will happen when you get super clear with what you want but um I need to update the manifesto to see what I want um but I know in the near term one thing I've been working on kind of quietly behind the scenes is I'm actually writing I actually have written my first book um called the theory constraints. So like that was also something that I was like uh a bunch of people including Alex Becker it's like never write a book it's not good for marketing blah blah blah like you don't need a book. So I was like oh I don't need a book like I don't need a book. And then I finally realized like you know one thing I do if anybody's been a client of mine before is inside of my portal I have like dozens of Google documents that are 30 40 50 pages long. Like some of my YouTube videos are 2-hour long Google documents that I'm just reading through. Like so I truly love to write. Um, and so I just had these things about why I shouldn't write a book. So anyway, I'm gonna be writing a book. I hope to get that published this year. I'm very excited about that. You talked about like, hey, should I pay this guy on one of these websites? You know, I'll give a huge shout out to Sahil Bloom. So, uh, many of people that know Sahil, I'm fortunate enough to know him. And, um, I I actually paid, uh, a couple thousand dollars to have a one-on-one call with him, I think a year or two years ago. And it wasn't even about writing a book. It was about something else. We got to know each other. And then when I wanted to write the book, going back to like, hey, let me interview 20 people. He had just published his book, the five uh levels of wealth or five types of wealth and crushed it. I mean, New York Times bestseller. I don't know how many he share how much he's sharing numbers, so I won't go too much into it, but um I was like, "Yo, can I hop on a call?" And he's like, "It's five grand now for an hour of my time." I was like, "Fuck it. Yeah, let's do it." And I learned so much on that one hour call. Like that was so like exactly what I needed to launch this book. So, um, anyway, so I'm writing a book and, um, I honestly don't know. I will tell you, I might I might come back to regret this later, but I've always told my fiance like, okay, like two to three years to have kids. Two to three years to have kids, two, to three. But being back in my in my hometown and being I just became a godfather to my nephew, my brother's son, like and seeing how cute that baby is and how much joy they bring. Like, and once again, I'm prescribing to all of these other people that I hear about like, "Oh, kids like, oh, they drag you down, blah, blah, blah." But then I'll give another huge shout out. One of my closest friends, his name is Carlton Dennis. Um, and he's like this like legendary tax uh fin like CPA guy. He has a huge YouTube channel. And so they just had their baby. And like within a couple of weeks of having their baby, he hosted this mastermind in Miami that I I went and spoke at. And we're at MA, which is this like restaurant in Miami that's like a club. It's like 11:00 at night. They're like taking shots. We're having this like, you know, $4,000 meal. Like, yo, where's the baby at? He's like, oh, they're at home with the nanny number one. I was like, nanny number one? He's like, oh, well, we got two nannies that we travel with. And I was like, bro, that's the way that you should should be doing it. You know what I mean? Like he So, he was the person that had shown me like, actually, you can have a kid. you can have all the benefits of having the kid without the downsides like no sleep and having to be like you can't live your own life etc etc and so just I continue to have my beliefs shattered. So I say all that to say like who knows I might increase the time the or shorten the timeline of me having a kid. I feel like that would be another huge thing that I've always wanted to do. Um and outside that I think it would be really cool to have this holding co get to 100 million a year in revenue with like six people. That's like that's one of that's like I want to have a super lean team that we just parachute inside these companies. And you know I used to have a 50 person company and then once again when I was trying to streamline some stuff now we're at 24 people and I love my team members and I I couldn't get lower than that in the current offer that we have. That's exactly the perfect amount. But I think like in my long-term horizon, it'd be cool to literally have a handful of people and my dollar per employee is like $10 million or $20 million per employee, like a true hedge fund or something like that and um and just make a small amount of people incredibly incredibly wealthy and have a huge impact. That's that's something I see like in the next three to five years. Yeah, it's amazing. last one because now it's when I started to do all these YouTube videos, it was the intent and I say in the beginning I'm like my goal is I want to get talent for the businesses because I speak specifically in info coaching land and all that. It's like talent, I want opportunities and I want network and what network meant essentially was like literally friends, right? Like people I could talk with about this and came back to hometown have these dinners and stuff love my OG 15ear friends like we're still thick as thieves like all good and they're crushing in their own domains but not within like this line of work. Um, so it's difficult to kind of talk about and talk about the numbers and talk about the stuff there in the same way. So I was like, I just want other people I can jam with. And I think something that I've seen of you and you mentioned a handful of names on this is like you've built that, right? You've got you're talking Cole, you're talking um, uh, Dan, you're talking Carlton, you're talking these guys and I see I've seen, you know, on social or whatever, you guys go on these trips or you are at masterminds. Like I think you've done a fantastic job of like cultivating a crew of that. So how do you how do you view that? Like I mean that's a that's a life hack that if you don't know it yet, you are 100% hitting where it compounds and it's 1 plus one plus one of you guys equals like 55, right? Like it's it's cool. So what how do you view that and then we we can wrap. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. It's funny. Um, I think it's it's I think it's similar to the relationship thing where, you know, I think that if you and the content thing, if we just take it all full circle for what I said at the very beginning, if you just focus on being the absolute best version of yourself that you truly are like that you really really align with this. Um, and then you add in distribution. So, that's the only thing that lot you can't just be the absolute version of yourself, live in this tiny little city in in a middle of nowhere and nobody knows about you. that's just not going to work in today's day and age. So like it's funny all of my friends that so for example Cole um I was a client of his uh and that was how we became friends. Carlton he was a client of mine and that was how we became friends and like the only reason for example I think Cole him and I became friends was because he offered a one-on-one call with me when I was a client of his and the only reason they offered a one-on-one call with me was because he had consumed my YouTube content and he was like he wanted to ask me a couple of questions, right? And so that was because I had the content in the first place. So I think that if you are like vibrating at this frequency where you're just truly yourself, I don't know. I think other authentic people can pick that up. And then of course you need to have some kind of value exchange there. So like if I was like I don't know this a soul sucker like and even if I had a big audience they wouldn't hang out with me but because I would imagine in some way I add value to their lives. So that's the one element and then absolutely having distribution is a huge part of it because like friends that I have and places that I get invited to and it's all because I have an audience already and and so people either feel like they know me or maybe they want access to some of my audience etc etc. Um and then the other thing is I'm just super intentional with it. You know I go back to the I told you earlier the thing I value more than anything else in this world is quality time with quality people. So it was like cool, we just identified, all right, there's going to be three or four big trips a year that we take. It's going to be with like three to four guys that are in this realm. You can invite your wives or your girlfriends and we've done China, Japan, Dubai, South Africa. Like, so it's like, okay, cool. This is probably going to be 10 days. Like South Africa, we had no Wi-Fi. You know what I mean? Like, so you're not going to be grinding there every single day. like you know so you got to be you got to be willing to invest in that which investing includes the opportunity cost of not working on your business during that time but instead you're building these relationships um and I would say that that's probably the primary way that I've done it and then just like anything else um like you and I have had a great conversation so far like you know that was because Cole introduced us together and so bec there's that network effect where um a great example is uh Cole and Carlton I'll just use that cuz they're some of my closest friends they didn't know each other previously, but then I invited Cole one year to my New Year's Eve Cabo trip that I was doing every year for a couple years. And then I also invited Carlton and so then now now they have separate relationships uh like outside of me that they met through me as well. So it is a little bit of that like network effect that happens. But the main thing um is first of all it's okay if you don't have that if you don't care about it. So identify do you want this in the first place like if you're an introvert you don't care about it then it doesn't matter. But if you do want it, then I think becoming like a a subject matter expert on something that other people find valuable. Um, being successful in however you define that and then it's having other people know that you're the subject matter actor that's successful in however you define that. Then the opportunities aka relationships like Dan Martell and I met because he wanted to get on my podcast. Um, and now I'm really close with his creative director Sam as well. Like I got a nice text from him literally two days ago. So that was because I had an audience and and then we became, you know, he said in the podcast, RV is the only guy that I think likes systems more than I do. You know what I mean? Like it's like that's so then we connected that way. So yeah, that's what I would say. Yeah. No, that's uh that's super Cole said very similar. He was like some of the best events cuz we were talking about like what I want to do with this now cuz I don't sell anything and my goal isn't right. So, like there's not really a mastermindy play directly, but uh he was like, "Some of the best times I've had is get everyone to basically throw five or 10 or whatever to basically cover fees and I've gotten like a box somewhere at uh whatever golf thing or he's like or we went Scott, we did that." Yeah. Yeah. He's like, "I've done some stuff like that where it's just like it's just good people hanging around and then other people from get connected there that are maybe outside the industry that bring like different value." So, he's like, "Yeah, it's a good time." So, we can wrap there. We're already over an hour and I know I said an hour. So this is amazing. This was extremely helpful and much different than usually they're very funnel marketing info. I I figured it was I was like we're probably doing a little bit more on the people listen to this are it's crazy the inflow. We didn't talk much about that but like the inflow I've gotten from this is people doing one two five million a month in info. Um the affiliate lead genen uh agency those guys um through X and YouTube. It's almost like X is an extension of YouTube for how mine's set up. the the follower track like 5% different travels. So it's like 8,000 here, 8,000 here or like it just like goes like this. So it's communication on X and networking on X and then just like platform videoing it on YouTube. So it's like a little library. It's kind of fun. So that's actually amazing. I definitely want to rip a part two or something fun. I just started doing them in person a little bit when I was in Miami with Jeremy H. Yeah, let me know. Cool. Yeah, dude. you. Well, I would love to connect with you in person as well. And um yeah, maybe if we get to know each other a little bit more soon, we can have you come one of these trips or come check out the lakehouse or something like that, dude. Sounds great. All right. Well, I look forward to seeing all your Let me know when this goes live so I can I can publish. I'll probably do what's today? Thursday. I'll probably just do Friday. I had one go live yesterday. I was going daily, so they were just like literally five minutes after. But this one I can actually sit on. Is Cole's out right now? Yeah, Cole's already out. I'm going to go check out Cole's after this. Yeah, Cole's Cole's is funny. His is good. He's an awesome guy. Yeah. Thank him for the intro. Cool, brother. Appreciate your time. We'll talk with you soon. See you. Right. Bye.
