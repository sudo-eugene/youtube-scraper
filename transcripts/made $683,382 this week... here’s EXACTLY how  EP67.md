In today's video, I'm going to be sharing raw exact strategies on how we did $683,382 in the last 7 days. Comes out to around $97,000 a day on average. I'm going to walk through the marketing, sales, and fulfillment systems that we use right now to achieve this. And if you stick around to the end, I'm going to talk about how we are planning to 3.1x this to get to 10 million a month. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in this business. We've now done over 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No guru, no course, no mastermind, nothing. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing as you will see in this video. All with the goal of finding top talent to join the team opportunities and network with cool people building cool So, let's get into it. All right, so May 11 to today, I I took the screenshot right before this. It's 35 after right now. Let's get into the funnels. So, this is the web of all of the funnels. I'm going to go one by one first of what we're running in marketing and then we're going to talk about how they all connect. So, to start, we have a VSSL opt-in funnel. This is our core funnel. This is exactly what we used to do 70 million of that cash collected before we started to pivot and do more. I think we should have broke earlier, but we did not. So, if you've been on the channel before, today's day 70 or 66 of me doing this in a row. And you can see kind of more deep dive some of the past stuff and the evolution. But to start, we have an opt-in page. We're going to have name and email. We do not collect phone number because we do not use it well enough. Okay? So, we just have name and email on the ops. We are then going to go to a VSSL page that will have the VSSL, nothing else on the page. wait until the CTA in the video to do the popup for the apply button. They will go to a dedicated application page where they will apply. This same application page is the one that's going to be used across a lot of these and it what is the main CTA on any of the social assets on the site anywhere. They come direct through application. They will then land on a booking page where they can book. They will then go to a success page that is flooded with testimonials, pre-objection block, what you should know before your call. They get on the phone with the closer and then they join the uh program, become a client. Okay, so that's the VSSL opt-in funnel. Now, what we're doing here is we were testing multiple opt-in pages running through the same VSSL and then all around the same messaging and then we were also testing two different VSSLs that were on the same messaging. Ended up not flopping necessarily, but the control one. So, we had these running. Now, why I kept this here is because we're running two tests right now and seeing what happens. But essentially, the main VSSL funnel that's running has we're testing another messaging style of uh VSSL. So basically, you know, imagine you're talking about this messaging pocket, then this match messaging pocket. Two different ones. What we're starting to see is because the alignment's not there on the messaging that's on the opt-in page to the VSSL, it is not converting. So, we have that off. Now, what we or we don't have it off yet, but we're letting it run. The big one that we're doing is we're running a completely second standalone VSSL funnel. So, this is like one to one. So, paid to ad direct to a different opt-in page to a different VSSL through the same application. So, there's where they connect back. And this one is crushing for us. So, we ran this one on call it, you know, whatever. We're just going to call it pocket one of messaging and pocket two. Still selling the same program, but bring them in through something different. Think like thyroid versus general fat loss or think like, you know, I mean, stuff like that, like different messaging pocket is what I mean. This one is crushing for us. We have not scaled into it heavily and this one still tried and true works at, you know, call it five figures a day in ad budget. Okay, so this is funnel number one. This is a majorityish at this point of the heavy lifting. Now, funnel number two is a DTA, which is what we're calling it, which is a direct application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL. So, you can watch other videos where we tested this. We essentially had three of them going, same headline, different VSSL, same application, three running all through one link as a split. We use VWO for that. I have other videos where we talk about that on the tracking. They will then apply direct there. Okay, that goes the application comes up in a pop-up. Once they fill it out, they then go over to the booking page. And then from the booking page to success, same flow as this. Okay. Now, the big difference here, and I just did a video with Eddie Malof on this and talked about this, but for us, we were testing this with the button on the page immediately visible. So, someone did not have to consume anything. Now, this will have way lower consumption, right? Because it has less friction or guess the other way around. It has less consumption and less friction. Um, and because of that, this one is getting extremely cost effective apps and bookings. And even on like uh just data metric you just look quick on like or basically contextually or the content of the applications they are high quality but they are not showing as well and they're not closing as well because they don't have as much friction. Okay. So we're doing what we can to try and grow that but in current state that is not backing out amazing for us. It's doing okay and it's definitely profitable but it's not like as scalable into it. Now we optimize around purchase instead of around schedule. A lot of people optimize for schedule. We have not been able to do that because of just some of the different things we've broken on the pixel which we're working on right now. Okay. Now, the big test here that we are doing is we just launched this as a split. That's why I put it here. So, two-way split where this one is actually waiting to show the CTA page or the CTA button to apply until 5 minutes in. The actual VSSL CTA is the same one that's running up here. For example, this is a 25m minute VSSL and 20 minutes in or whatever it does the CTA. That's when this button pops. This one it's always on and this one we're only waiting five minutes based on the idea that if someone opts in you can email market to them back here. That's why we didn't do one. But we need a little bit more friction to try and see if we can basically just gently increase the consumption, gently increase the cost but vastly increase the backend return. Okay, so hopefully that makes sense. Now low ticket we are doing a low ticket ascension funnel not AOV or like front-end profitability focused. I mean that is the goal at some level is to you know get it either making money or as close to as possible. Our target is 50% SLO. Um so I think it's SLO SL selfquidating. Um so we are running three of these. Again one of the big things we found out about this so quick through the funnel. They land on a sales page that is long form. It'll have two it'll basically say start checkout. They'll start with their name and email and click like continue. It'll bring them to a two-step. So here so you capture that information. You have ops that then you can then re uh retarget to who don't complete checkout. Basically can abandon and cart. They'll come here on this checkout page. These technically we're running three different that are completely three different designs. So the checkout pages are in alignment with the design. They will then go to once they purchase they'll go to a booking page. When they book it is framed as a starter call uh you know quick start something like that. And is actually booked with a setter. Okay. So they'll book with a setter. Then they will go over here and book with a closer. the setter will push them to set with a closer or they will set it with the closer and then they will purchase. Okay, now backing up on this for us this being ascension focused it is built for the setter call and for the closer call to get them into the high ticket. It is not trying to liquidate them. It does not have upsell one two three trying to get an a higher AOV. The only leverage we have is within here to get order bumps on this. Now I'm going to talk through these all in one and we're going to talk about what we changed and what's working now for us to achieve this. So these funnels all three run independently with traffic but they over they they are in connection okay because someone will see this then they'll come over here then they'll buy low ticket they'll get set through here so technically they initialized here but then their last click was within this they'll end up talking to a setter closer okay in here they'll route through it like all of the things you can imagine. So the big things that we're changing for the VSSL side of things for this opt-in funnel is this secondary messaging is huge. So we're leaning into that. So we have three main core pockets around messaging. We're going to test three different ones and we are also testing three different brand faces which introduces another variable but we are confident in it because they are working on the ad side towards this one that is another brand face. So imagine you have a video of me in an ad. Then you land on there and some and you know some other guy is talking and is then doing the training. there's a bit of uh it doesn't pass the continuity test. Okay. So, we are in pretty we're pretty certain that it's going to work. So, we're going to test three different ones of those, but right now we're testing one that's just different messaging with the original brand face. Okay. So, that's through and through there and it's working. We are constantly doing different splits on the designs of these two pages. And just so I can go a little deeper, the these pages technically split out because there's a router inside the application for all three of these applications that um will send them based on the quality of their application responses and their financial qualifiers and stuff to a DQ version of this that either gets picked up by setters or the kind of like ramping lower reps. Okay, now that is the main core changes we're launching here. I think that it's going to work for us. I think that uh you know, we ran this initial VSSL funnel too hard. Um, so we're booking x amount per day. And the cost per call has come down pretty significantly since we got our CMO in. So the real answer to all this is like what's working now for marketing, sales, fulfillment, ops is people. That's like the the simple answer for this. But I'm trying to give you some t uh tactical stuff on what the people are implementing. And again, this is our team doing this and with us, not not me in there clicking the buttons or having the conversations. Okay, so that's what's running there. DTA, I just talked about what our plan is. So we are testing one right now that's a five minute. We may have to delay to three. We may have to put a timer on page that shows it's going to pop in three to five minutes. Something along those lines. Or we just need to be able to cook the pixel well enough that add enough friction inside the application that they have on page that it actually makes sense for them or that it actually uh qualifies them enough to make it through to the next page. Okay. So dancing around back and forth. The harder option is complete other VSSL. That's qualifies them more. But the issue is they may not ever actually completely watch the VSSL even if you don't have the delay. They can't necessarily you can't confirm that they're watching the VSSL. Okay, so that's the gist there. And then low ticket. This has been a very interesting journey for us. So for us, we because we have millions of contacts and millions of people in the system and have been running this for years. When we launched this, we already knew that some of the leads or some of the buyers more so were coming from existing people in the CRM, whether that's four years old or three days old. Um, but as we continued to lean into it, it looked as if more of like 70% of the traffic was coming through warm leads. So, or 70% of the purchasers were coming through warm leads, which makes it more of a retargeting asset than a cold scalable low ticket product. Okay. So, stats on this are phenomenal. Um, well, more so the stats on this on how they back out on the all that. Uh what we're struggling with is getting the net CPA and actually having it be new not as a retargeting only because to truly scale this to hundreds and thousands or whatever of units a day we need to make sure that it is cold friendly. Okay. So we basically built out two different variations that are same product just different framing that makes it a little bit more cold friendly and same with the page design and it is working well. So we're testing things on uh Facebook or on meta side of things to do that as well as there. Okay. Now, all of this is more so how did we get people to the system or into the system and how did we get people onto the calendars and the phones, but this is more so how did we actually like collect the cash, right? So, now we're going to get into sales and fulfillment. So, I said we brought on a new cso, same team, same everything. and he came in and layered in energy, structure, focus on numbers, new scripting, new standardization, all these things, and just brought life back into the existing team that's already there. And just like that, we had a pretty stark uptick. I can do an entire video on this, but just that alone, which is interesting because we had a few different sales managers that we were interviewing for for that role that all of them had said like, "Oh, these are the standard KPIs that we'll run by or like the bare minimum." And all of them were light years ahead of what ours were, which was very interesting. It wasn't just from one person. We did get the best of the best that we wanted and we're very happy about that. But it was very interesting that it came from across the board and from people I talked to in the industry that had that. So he raised the bar and the standard with the same team. So now begins training, development, structure, uh, standardization around our like all the things in that. And that is going to be an even bigger boost to this essentially is my plan or is what is what we're thinking. So sales is crushing it right now and they're only going to crush it more. This was only their first week in it which is great to see. So fulfillment side of things developing here is essentially different programs that we're rolling out of the back end. It technically has not been it's not reflective of this because this start this rolls out tomorrow what I'm about to talk about. Um but we are rolling out things like we're basically rolling out two different options for retention. We have never focused strong on LTV which would be included in this gross volume not the new volume. Um but a majority of this came from new. Okay. So, where fulfillment is crushing is we are getting plenty and plenty a day of client results, client wins that then feed back into the marketing and sales system that we can use to help uh leads become buyers because they are seeing that we get them results. Okay. But we are not doing an effective job of and what we need to change that I think will just explode this is the framing during year one to stay into year two. And we have never had conversations about that. We've never put it into the programming into the planning into how the product is structured. You all know the product that on month nine or 11 or whatever before your thing's up they start to frame you and talk about what's going to happen in the next year and how amazing it is. We do not do that because we have never really offered that in a clean way. So just changing that is what we're rolling out to start and changing that and also offerings of different things. So basically multiple more years on the back end that you can purchase up front. So think something that's higher ticket. Think something that is lower ticket that is continuity because that's going to be a majority of current state people who want to stick around paid their high ticket thing once but they want to stay for community access um all the things in that way just not the onetoone personalization as much but maybe like a group or a many to one uh version. So for that uh I think that's going to be a huge thing. It's also going to help the enterprise value when we can have a long-term recurring thing. uh if you follow me on X, I'm like I'm studying all these like customer uh retention and community management all these stuff books because I want to get ahead of it. So we're launching those on the tail and then operations we just have an amazing CMO, we have an amazing cso now. We have an amazing chief product and these divisions are like ready and powerhouses. So now they're all working together. Initially I always say like what's your bottleneck? We thought it was marketing because where the lead flow was uh was not ideal and also the cost like just kind of the whole situation and sales was not backing out the leads. So we're like this is a marketing issue and granted it was at some level and we brought in a CMO restructured everything built it for scale was amazed at how we were even doing it how we were. We were only running one funnel. We were set up very messy inside of our ad accounts and he completely restructured that setup and is now set up for scale sales. I'm sorry. Once we solve for that, it still weren't backing out into sales, and we're like, "Okay, wait a minute. This is a two-prong problem here, which then is going to solve for sales." We had a sales manager that got us from 1 million to 3 million, helped us like crush in that way, and then uh over the x amount of time has been interested in becoming an entrepreneur, and we helped him go and do that, and he phased out clean and we brought in the new one that I found through my network on YouTube and X, and uh brought him in, and he's just going to be a powerhouse. Like, he just he crushes. So after solving for that just that is what got this lift right here. So having all the marketing restructured so that we could consistently fill calendars with quality and then having sales layer in is there and then fulfillment is the next batch of what we're doing. They're already crushing it in terms of results but now we just need to do it in a way that boosts LTV more not just gets the one-time result. Okay. Operations like I said is all of them in one. Now what are we doing to get to 300K a day? So those back-end ones and just more volume very very simply put that's exactly the plan. So we in the marketing front let's go one by one. In the marketing front the goal would be to have essentially three of these maybe or three of these andor these and then three of these. Right? So you're going to have imagine person one that talks about messaging one and they're going to have three different styles of funnels or two two to three. You're gonna have one that's VSSL focused. You're going to have one that's low ticket that's actually a purchase that's uh based on ascension. You're then going to have uh another person with another messaging pocket here and here all under one brand name. You reduce founder risk, you reduce market saturation, like all these different things all under one brand name. So that is going to be a huge lift. And then we're going to go one by one so we don't overdo it. Uh one other thing I forgot to mention in this in sales is setters. We scaled to 24 setters. We had zero setters uh up to 71 million. We had never done setters ever. um not effectively. We kind of tried it once but not really. Um they are in every pocket of this. Someone who applies but doesn't book and falls off. Um somebody who books and doesn't show. Somebody who submits a form or custom time request because it doesn't the times on the calendar don't work for them. Um this one they are huge. They're major major leverage and they actually have the highest show rates and close rates through this system with low ticket ascension. They'll get auto booked in with for a 15-minute zoom. They will talk to the person, you know, make sure they have all their stuff and then frame them to why did you not, you know, try and book the or why did you not try and apply for our onetoone coaching? It has better results. It has all this kind of stuff. They do an amazing job framing here. So, there's going to be a huge evolution with that team because it's they're mainly doing inbound hot leads and we have, you know, a million and some change leads right now in the system. High hundreds of thousands uh in the system that have phone number and then the rest are email. So, they're going to be able to work the people in the pipeline. We have Facebook groups. We have inbound phone number stuff we can add. We have all the things. So that's just more like volume. Um but for us right now it's going to be for the marketing front. It's going to be pushing these further because they can go so much further and then also layering in the other ones at the same time. Marketing team is growing to have more structure in that way. Sales is going to grow is is going to kind of do two things. It's going to like tighten up. So the current team is going to get I'm sure a little bit tighter and they're going to have more expectations standards and more performance. We are then going to grow the team directly through external hires that we are then going to be able to scale into through that. There's going to be a lot of stuff that changes for them. Our expectations, things around that. Uh as well as close baseline percentages that did not exist prior. Uh in alignment with that, the comp will get better for that. Comp will get better for that and comp will get better for that. I'm setting that up right now so that margin stays locked as we scale in which was not what happened when we went from 12 to 30. Um and that's there. And then fulfillment is the behemoth. That's basically what we are going to be focusing on what my main focus is going to be on as we begin to lean into this because everyone every person that churns through here or is not fulfilled on in the way that frames them for the second year is just leaky bucket and lost LTV. So that's the next focus is what we can do with other offerings on the back. We are talking about offering something else on the front end that's a bit um higher ticket potentially. Um, we do have people who ask for it already, so it could fit, but again, that's just more of a fulfillment headache when we're rolling this out. So, right now, I just want to focus on the core offering, making sure it's dialed for that, and then making sure that the backend, too, are built out and structured in a good way with the right retention team, which is kind of a sales function. So, hope that makes sense. I think just pushing that'll get us to 10. And then I want to talk about some crazy  But until then, this is what we're going to do. This is where we're cranking at 19 minutes. What's working now for us? I hope that was indepth enough. Been talking a little headier stuff and yeah, find your bottleneck. So in here, if you go to rinccclugg.com, www.ryclog.com/docck, I have all the videos I've done. I'm on day 60, whatever, seven in a row of doing these. And you can sort them by here by tech, marketing, sales, ops, mindset, or just watch them in order. I mean, this is just me talking through random things, but they all do connect. And it's been a journey. I have days in here where we're losing 30 grand trying to figure out what's going wrong. And now we are doing, you know, 100ish a day, which is good, but not even close to where we're going. So, hopefully this was helpful. Appreciate you guys. Drop some comments. Let me know some feedback, what you'd like to see or see less of, more of. Uh, I appreciate it. So talk on X or IG and I'll see you
