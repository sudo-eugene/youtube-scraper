In today's video, I'm going to share how we did $34,161 in six days testing digital products. We're going to go through all the metrics that are important to us, like how many front-end purchases we had, how many calls he's generated for the different teams, the back-end purchases of our high ticket program, and the ascension rates through them. We're going to do a deep dive across all the metrics throughout the entire funnel, and then a plan as to what we're going to do with optimizations where we're going to take this thing and examples at the different rates. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected all through a high ticket VSSL call funnel. And I make all the videos on this channel just to share what failed, what worked and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, what I mean by digital products in this for us is a low ticket info product that we are selling with the goal of ascending them into our back-end high ticket program. Okay. So for purchases, just getting straight into it, we had across this range of testing 153. I have other videos on the channel where I go through kind of our ideology here and how we're and why we're going from uh high ticket only to low ticket on the front end. Uh and that's part of our plan to get to this 100 million a year mark. So of those low ticket purchases, it's a $37 AOV right now, which is $5,661 in cash collect on the front. That generated oops 77 calls with setters. From those 77 calls with setters, we have 32 that then went to closers that were pre-framed over. Back-end purchases, we had five by our high ticket back-end program, which is $28,000 in cash collected, 20,500 technically, uh, in back-end purchases, which is a 3.2% ascension rate on units. All right, so that's where we're coming up with our 34,161. So, let me get into the entire funnel and then we'll go into the metrics. So, right now, we're actually only running Facebook. uh Google starts today and it's April 2nd, 2025. Um so Google starts today, but right now all meta traffic and even that in itself has like 92 variations and splits and new ads that are going and not splits but you know new ads that are testing that we're going through. Um but as of now we're running a three-way split across this six-day range that is basically three like complete funnels. So the sales page is splitting but then goes to a checkout page that's splitting that goes to a booking. So all are actually like one singular split. So all the same design across one. All the same design across one. Meaning you can't go from this variation to this control, right? Um so I'm going to go through the metrics across all of these, but essentially someone lands on a sales page, they give the name and email to land on the checkout page. Uh so it's like a two-step. Then on the checkout page, they purchase the Otto. In a lot of low tickets, you're going to have like upsells and try and increase AOV with add-ons and cross cells and things like that. We do not have any of that because our goal is to get them on the calendar to then talk to a setter and then talk to a sales rep. Okay. So, for us, it's a booking widget that then goes on the setter calendar where they then land on a thank you page with a like questionnaire application they can put on. Um, that's also very valuable and information because we found the more people that fill this out uh and the deeper that they fill this out, the more info um or the more likely they are to close. Um, so they land in this call scheduled. Then I'm going to go through the different outcomes that can happen from the setter call itself. So no show cancel follow-up close lost close one uh which is a set in this case that then lands in a call scheduled for the closer calendar and then how they land in the buckets for no show cancel all the things uh down to close one. All right now starting with the front end of the funnel. This is the control. So this is how many views the actual control had. And you'll see the difference here on these. Um I'm using VWO for all these stats and like it's as close as it can be. Um, but just take that for granted or take that as like a grain of salt. Um, with a grain of salt. Jeez. Uh, so these different ones are going to have different traffic based on a 33 33 33 split. And in the middle, I'll show you, but we turned this one off and that's why it has lower. Okay, so this date range is constantly like across this date range is this data, but it's constantly in flow and in motion because people can be in these different steps and then come back to them later. Um, and I'll show you that right there. So across this test, we had the control was getting a 10% uh that are doing the one step. So they're giving name and email and going to the checkout page. Of those people who purchased, so 62 buyers, so 123 people opted in, gave us name and email. 62 of them then purchased. So 10% rate from here to here, 50% rate from here to here, and then 27% of them booked a call with a setter. Okay, not great right here. These are very solid right now. The variation one is essentially like a lighter design that is uh like completely rebranded, but the is like light versus dark on these. So on this one, we had a 7.9. Not as good. We had uh not as good on the checkout and not as good or better, I'm sorry, way better on the book a call. Okay. So, of those that came through, we had 20 calls that popped out, which is really the optimization point uh that we're going for because it continues it down the funnel. So yes, the math would be better on this because you'd have um 43% that are actually purchasing through um I'm sorry uh you know what I mean? So we'll have 34 that are buying out of that pocket. So you are getting more dollars but you're not getting what you actually like what the goal is on the back end. So then of the variation two we had 9% uh on the v on the opt-in page portion of the checkout. Then 53% of those actually checked out from um the and turned into an actual purchaser. So 57 of those 53% and then this one has a 70% booking rate. Okay. So when we were looking at all this data essentially we're like okay so two is just losing right like if you look at um the total count of purchases across this range. It's like 62 versus 34 versus 57. Basically with the same traffic. Now the reason this one's lower like I said is because we actually turned this one off like a day into uh a day ago. So 5 days into the test now all the traffic will run to these two. Why we're continuing to run this is because one, it's branded and more in style of what we're going for. Two, it is getting a better backout rate on this, which is more important. And that's a a lot to do with how this page is designed right here on this Otto booking page. Um, so this one is better in like a lot of ways. And it also backs out better, okay, into this, which is the most important. Now, um, we're going to go through here and then I'll go back to these on how we can optimize, but of that total across this range, we had 77 calls, right, across these that then land on a set calendar. Now, again, I want to like emphasize the data on here is as accurate as it can be. But because people get stuck into these stage, like whatever this is, 153. Yeah, we said 153 purchases across here. Only 77 booked. That does not mean that 77 are ever going to book. like by the time that I refresh this, we could have 80 of these calls that came from these purchases. And because we're actively running traffic, it the the data is constantly like updating itself as who's in the pipeline of things that can go to the next step. So if you turned off ads, all of your numbers would climb over time theoretically because you would have people that then book on calendars later that then buy later. And how long is that sales cycle versus this 5day snapshot and picture which is like as best as we can do for an example like this. Okay, so 77 calls scheduled with setters. Now, of those 14 no showed, four cancelled, 14 are in follow-up, which is basically like they're not ready yet to take the step, but like keep them on the radar. Close loss, meaning like completely not interested, disqualified due to financial, any of those things. And then closed one, which we are is a set, right? So, when when you win a setter call, it's a closed set. Okay? Now, those 32 carry over. So 41% of these calls scheduled made it onto a closer calendar. All right. So going back through here on this you have right you have 40 calls. Let's just use this one as an example. Of the 107 optins you got 57 purchases. 40 of those booked a call. Now into here 32 of them have now set with a closer. Okay. Okay. So, of those 32 that are on a closer calendar, important here, these are pre-frame. These are like excited. They have context on what's happening. They didn't just like cold book. They're not just direct from ads. Like way juicier than just your VSSL direct. So, one no-show, seven cancels, 10 hot listings, two low ticket follow, or I'm sorry, long-term. I use LT twice. So, long-term follow-up. So, a hot listing is basically going to mean that somebody is um like in the queue, has to talk to husband, uh interested, qualified, just like hasn't gotten over the finish line. Uh long-term follow-up is someone who needs six months, needs three months to, you know, get funds together or it's not in the time and place in their life. Closed, lost, DQ, financially not qualified, um not interested, not a fit, whatever. And then closed one, we had five. So, 15.6% sales per booking, which is solid for us. Um so backing into this why these things would happen and where we can do optimizations. Okay so starting here just in toggling this one for example as full traffic will get us a call it 50% lift. Okay. And which will then drop costs in the same way because all of these you got to look at this as as and I'll go into examples down here of like the different costs and breakdowns across. But if you take this entire thing all the way netted out, we got five units on in total 153 purchases, which is a 3.2% ascension rate. Now, every single step of this can go up 1%, 5%, 20%. And as you do that, that ascension rate climbs because that that ascension rate is essentially like the sum total of all of these different percents. Okay. So, what we can do with these different layers and what we are doing. So, first things first, this so we're crowning these and likely we'll crown this one as a winner. Um, from here you can do a million other splits. You can do design splits, you can do headline splits, you can do complete offer splits, you can do like a million in one things. The these are like communication buckets is like what I'm calling them. So when somebody opts in but does not purchase. So on this this for example, we have 53%. Okay, so the first drop off point is how many people land on the ad and then opt in. So 90% of people don't give us their name and email. There are tools and things you can do to capture email and like rep push them to that. Not something we're interested in this time. We're only going to start with our communication on people who are name and email. So, they give it to us, but then 45% of them do not purchase. So, we have their name and email. We can remarket them. Um, and we do that right now with a push to purchase. So, it's an email sequence that goes back and forth and just pushes them there. It's not optimized. It's not built like the best way. So, right there, that could go from 53 to 58%. Call it. All right. Push to book. Same thing here. So now you have somebody who purchased but did not book a call and in this one it's cranking 70% is like fantastic but let's say we want to get to 75% like how would we do that? So a couple ways you can do email you have their phone number so you can do SMS because you have your phone number you can now have setters assigned here to dial out and get bookings from this directly um and other ways basically that and they sit in there and again this is across this date window of call it whatever this five or six day date window. If we turn everything off right now, this number could climb to 42 45. Like as they consume the product, you have CTAs in product. Um they're inside the community, they decide to book in a week or three weeks or a month. Uh and that's the beauty of this is these are buyers that now are inside of your network and inside of your system and in communities and in product and consuming content and doing all that and then will book and will buy later. Okay, so push to book, that's another one. And then push to app. We're not even leaning on this at all, but this is essentially people who did book with a setter but didn't fill out an application. um or like a like a questionnaire. It's not even the same application as the main. It has different info and different like what are your goals gathering a lot of free form to see like what they're interested in. So all of these as an example, you could get a 5% lift here and a 5% lift here and that'll dramatically change things as they go down the funnel. Now of those 77 that land with setters, the big thing that stands out to me here is 28 of these were no shows or cancels. So the automations to get people to show like the show rate uh like best practices are not even in place on this. We literally have nothing. We have like the two calendarly automated like hey your calls at this time hey your calls at this time. We have no preframe. We have no um like dynamic messaging. We have no direct SOP for setters on how they should handle these. We have no HubSpot branded email about like what you should prepare in your call. None of that. So this right here we could drop to 10 total. So right now if it's 18, let's say we get it to 10 of them no show and cancel. And if you're assuming that 41% of them become uh schedules or become with the closer call, like just that alone, you'd get four more bookings with closers. And obviously that's like blended math, so it doesn't like completely back out. But you know what I mean? Like if you could have three to four or more sets that would come from these because you have no idea if these people are qualified, if they canceled or no ship. You have no idea, right? You don't know if they land in this closed lost or follow-up. So optimizing around that doesn't exist yet. Now getting on with closer. These cancel and no-shows are interesting because this is like very low percentage which is amazing. Um but like cancels more so the no-shows. So what generally happens with somebody who cancels is yes something comes up every once in a while or like that's the number one excuse is something came up. I have work, I have a kid thing, I have something but generally what happens is they're researching you and you haven't done a good enough job of doing like pre-objection blocks. So you're not sending them the oh, you know, a loom of you explaining the reviews and how people online say it's 10k and people online say it's $40 a month and like all these different things and all of them are wrong and it's completely customized to the person and check out all these, you know, 300 reviews on Trust Pilot and like building that rapport because this is them doing their own research and then coming up with a reason on why they want to cancel. And you need to do a better job, we us included, and we need to do this on our VSSL funnel and our low ticket funnel, but do a better job of getting ahead of these and in front of these and having the proper framing to do so. So 10 of them landing in hot listing is like great. That's basically a closer like a not I don't say issue, but like a closer metric. So that's saying that 10 of them are basically ready and do qualify and likely have the funds and they just didn't get over the finish line. So optimizing your closers around this is fantastic. Um as like the goal long-term follow-up, these are just what they are. Also kind of a closer thing. Close loss. This generally speaking is like DQ. So it's could be optimized here by making it so the setters didn't even push them over to here because they're not interested in the product because they don't have the funds because they don't whatever. So this could be optimized by having less calls that actually come through. So all the percents will go up into the correct buckets of like uh total allocated. And then five closed one. Great. like 15% sales per booking is sol would be really solid for us on the VSSL funnel. Um our goal for this one is higher than that. Okay. Now let's say you blend this entire thing across. If you have again 10ish here solid you have 55 to 60ish here solid. You have 70 I mean 70 is fantastic but like if you hold that then you optimize around here to have less no-shows and cancels right the setters are brand new too. So we have setters and this low ticket with all the ads and stuff. Both of them are brand new. So none of this is optimized even in like the person itself and their skill, let alone the actual system and the network there. Um, but if we get all these percents up and go through here on this, we could have 60% of these and we could have this number closer to 100. Okay. And just in us changing this to be the uh variation two as like the main part of the funnel. The differences on this backout is would be higher than 100. Right? All right. If 70% of these are coming through and we had 153 bookings, like that in itself is whatever 110, whatever. I can't do that math right now. Um, so 77 would back out in a call scheduled, it would be 120. Assume the same percents across that, you know, the same proportional amount are going to know cancel that increases this. But if we solve for this, it increases this even more. This same thing that units would be seven, it would be nine, would be 11. And then all of this exactly again like I said over time. Okay. So, what my plan is is essentially to do these uh automations around here as the core piece. And we can uh introduce things like our AI SMS bot that we have uh Mandy Macros. I have other videos on this, but we have an AI bot that can message back and forth with complete context. So, it can say, "Oh, hey, you know, um so and so, I saw that you applied is the current use case we use, but like booked but didn't, you know, fill out your app or tried to purchase this and didn't or purchased but didn't book a call." And it can do those different automations with different uh goal like actions called actions split tests across this. So like I said right now we just got rid of this one. The control and this are still running. We're kind of just running the control just because it technically has higher stats on the on the uh purchases, but overall it's like not where we're going with brand in terms of design and it's also not where we're going um with splits like the ability to split and and uh and how the offer structured. So, it's going to be this and then likely what'll happen is we'll roll out two, three, four more of these of different things as the bonuses, different offers, different pieces there. Okay, optimizations basically what I talked about just different optimizations across this whole thing and knowing your numbers is like the number one thing for me at least. So, I can't make any decisions without knowing all these numbers and being able to because these can drive like basically behavior changes and decision um decision-m which is like the entire point of all this for me at least. Um and then AOV booster. So right now we are collecting $37 per on here and we are doing nothing to get more money. Nothing. And a lot of low ticket people and how they do it is it's like this true like economics game of how you do it where it's $37 on the front then there's a $197 upsell but then a 97 $97 downell. If you take the first upsell you there's a $397 and you get your AOV up to like $150. So that if your cost per uh purchase on the front end, which is the whole thing, is $75, like you're making double your money. If your AOV is uh 150 and your cost per purchase is 75, that's not the game we're playing because we're optimizing for this. Now, if we threw something in here that was like a $97 upsell after this purchase and then had a booking widget, for example, or only had the booking widget after an email or only in the product, yes, your economics would be better, but because we have a sales team, because we need to fill calendars and the goal is to have this start to take over a portion of how many calls are on day or fill a portion of the calendars, the volume is just too low and the time span is just too long in order to do that. Um, so not to say we will never play that game, but in this model specifically, it is built to be a a direct ascension funnel, not an economics play. Okay? But what we can do in AOV boosters is at this stage right here, um, so this post purchase, I'm sorry, I mean at this page on this checkout page, we can do order bumps. So statistically, according to a lot of sources, that it doesn't really affect conversion rate that much. All it does more or less is increase AOV. So in this case, we're selling a uh ultimate guide to macronutrients is the entire thing is about fitness. Um we can have a recipe book as an upsell. We can have so if you want like the more of the same model, you can have recipes. You can have like the master class that is like an advanced version or like the quick start guide. Um and then if you want to go into the direction of like what else do they need next? That's going to be workouts uh exercise style because you went from nutrition to exercise. But we can lean way more into likely a lot of this is obvious like this entire thing is being run by the CMO. He crushes it. He's doing all this is me sharing data about it and what the team is doing, not necessarily what I'm doing. Um, but having that as the uh AOV boost, we could go from $37 to $50 and that would completely change the economics. We could go to $75 or higher and as we begin to scale like CPA theoretically and you know proven is going to rise. So being able to match that. Now, examples of this in current state, we're about this one, but like let's say so you have a $10 net. So what $10 net means is that you have $37 purchase for example and it cost you $47 to get that purchase on on ads. Okay? So you spent 47 on uh Facebook, $37 back per unit. Now that's 10 net. So it really only cost you $10 to get them to the next stage of the funnel. And we can do all the math on this, but we'll be here for an hour and a half. But then you could basically divide that out. So if right here is that number, if 70% of those are booking a call, what's your cost per set call? Right? It's 13 bucks or whatever that is, right? Because if 70% of them are booking, I can't do that math right now, but let's say it's 50%. So it's easy. It would be double that. Okay? So, if it cost you $10 net to get a purchase, 50% of them booked, it would then cost you $20 to get a setter call. If you know that again, 50% of them schedule out and now it's $40 to get them on the phone with a sales rep. And if it and 10% sales per booking would be uh um what I say, $40 would be $400 cost per purchase, right? So, like that's how the mon the math funnels down. So, in the case of a 3% ascension, so we're just going to use 1% as the total versus purchases versus back-end purchases because it's the easiest one. And how you get to the 3% is blending all these percents. All right. And the quick math, and these are super simple numbers, um, but and totally oversimplified, but $10 net is going to be with a 3% ascension rate would be a 30 $333 CPA on the backend product. With a $50 net and the same ascension rate, it would be 1,600. With a $75 net, meaning it cost you whatever $110, $20 in ads to get a $37 buyer, right? That $75 net. 3% ascension rate would be a $2,500 CPA. So, our target is sub$,500. Okay. So, now, how do you need to change the math to get your net both in your CPA and your AOV to be a solid number in here and then also get your ascension rate to be like as high as possible? Like if I look at the stats from last month essentially when we were like test running this and all of this is date ranges and moving numbers if I look total versus across a week across a month. Um but like last month ours was 3.98 current month to date which is two or three days in it's like three. Okay. And if we stopped running ads tomorrow that number would slowly just increase until it was like five which is great. Um but that's not the case. We want to scale into this and sell a few hundred a day. So 50 this is basically where we're sitting right now. Now, the other model is what happens if we can optimize this entire funnel with everything I said here and got this to a 5% ascension rate. That same number gets you a $200 CPA. So, same net, just just a higher ascension rate because your funnel is built better and because your and your structure is built better. $200 CPA. 5% on this is a $1,000 CPA and 5% on this is a $1,500 CPA. Okay, so this is the model. Um, so how do we get this up from three to four to five across here? And then how do we keep that CPA or that net CPA down by both increasing AOV, decreasing ad costs, and like better optimizations there, sales page splits, and then the entire funnel. So, just want to give an update on kind of where we started and where we're at with this. And yeah, goal is to get this up to a couple hundred a day. This is just one niche, one product. I have other videos on the channel where I talk about how we did uh how our plan is like evolving and how we're thinking about different niche products or different messaging products that are uh low ticket as well as paired with the VSSL funnel. Um, but yeah, these are the current stats where we're at. And as always, Instagram for communication. Uh, it's in bio on here. And then comment, subscribe, all the things on what kind of content you want me to share. So, have a good week.
