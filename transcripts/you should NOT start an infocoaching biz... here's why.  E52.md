# you should NOT start an info/coaching biz... here's why. | E52

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing why you should not start an info coaching business based on the math. We're going to be talking about why most people want to start these and if it makes sense for you to do. And then we're going to go through marketing, sales, and the fulfillment of the different business models and do real-time math on how much profit each one of them makes you. And if you stick around to the end, I'm going to go through ways that people have 100xed this and made big boy money from their info coaching business. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business and we've done 72 73 million now in total in ours. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with same people doing cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. Now, why most people want to do this? Simplest reason is just like they see easy money. Okay, it's just like, oh, why wouldn't I? And it is in fact an easier business model and can be easy money in compared to in comparison to a lot of other business models. All right. So, the first thing I'm going to ask though is like what is your goal? Is your goal to make another 100 grand a month? Is your goal to have a full standup company and then exit it and do all these different things? Like the most important thing is what is your goal before you start to do this? Because the next thing that happens down on this is your focus then veers into this. There are ways to limit it in terms of time and money that you do that and or the exchange of those. But the biggest thing is, and the reason that where I'm coming from with this is I saw and inserted myself on someone's tweet where they were asking like why, you know, how do you guys do this onetoone coaching thing? It just like sucks up this time, but I can make a couple hundred grand doing it a month. And it's like, you're correct. You could. You 100% could. But the focus and for somebody like that and for people like that who have a main business and then who are basically bolting on info coaching for people who want to pay them to learn from them, it can be a massive distraction. like massive massive distraction. If you're building a software thing, if you're running e-commerce, if you're doing lead gen like any of these things and right now you're spending of your working hours, you're spending 100% more or less on this one thing or if you're already one of those people who have like two or three businesses and you're spending 33 33 like across the different businesses, which is already probably not good and one could be bigger than all three if you just focused. This is adding another thing to it. There are ways to limit that and there are ways to decrease the amount of time you spend by paying people to do it, but then you're still managing them. So the time instead of costing time which is you know the biggest resource you then exchange that for money which means you make less profit on it and you still have to spend time to do it and a lot of the time in these smaller ones like you still got to spend the time in general because people are paying for you. You are the expert. So people do it for cash flow. People say they're going to do it and they're going to exit theirs or people who just have info coaching businesses. Hormosi made a video on this and I'll be talking about that a little bit later. He just had one that came out recent. like you know 99.99% of people do not exit these businesses. There's like more or less like three that I can rattle off that actually sold and not big numbers and hormones even says on his it's like a licensing company that he sold and and they call them education businesses instead of info coaching. It's like you know similarish. Uh and I'll get into why they're sold and how they sold because he talked about it in a video. That's a direct copy from that and then I'll talk about like 10 other examples of cool ways that people have done it um not to sell but to make literally 100x down here at the end of the video. But exiting it's just like don't even account for it. Unless you're doing something that's like the 0.01% you're not going to exit. So it's strictly a cash flow game and that's why you're doing it. Um it is easier than a lot of businesses. There's no doubt about that. like spinning up like an events business even or even some of the physical e-commerce stuff with you know fulfillment and having to do like there's it's an easier business model the cost to fill generally is like or the the method of fulfillment is generally speaking time or pre-recorded or like a one to many situation which is easier um and then I would urge you to really only do this if you are expert in the field uh if you are a lot of people in this like info coaching game sell to each other so it's like info person selling to info person or like online marketer selling to online marketer and it's like this vicious circle and like I hate it. I'm not a fan of it. Like I mean we've bought them for sure. Um I buy everything like that but I don't know it just like kind of rubs me wrong versus like being an expert to of in XYZ niche and using online marketing to fuel it. So example fitness. I heard somebody talking about like a a gardening one that was doing over seven figures. Dog walking or dog training I'm sorry not walking that was doing over seven figures. Being an expert in the field and then bolting on the online marketing I think is like the real pure way to do this because you're just maximizing you know you're throwing a magnifying glass on that expert's thing demand are people already asking for it for examp like you know we have our expert for example gets plenty of DMs asking for coaching or onetoone or this and that um you know people ask me for consulting like there's a demand for it already or you are solving a problem it's all comes down to solving a problem like can you provide the value and solve the problem and then time versus money kind quickly talked on this already, but the different models and how you do this or if you even do this is a time and money exchange. So, a lot of the time these business models are are expend on your time for money. So, it's still like a you still have an hourly rate when you do this and everything you do has an hourly rate. So, like knowing that going into this and trying to optimize it for where you make 10 grand an hour versus you make $150 an hour, like you need to think about that going into this. And then when you replace yourself and pay people to do it, you're limiting your time, but you are increasing the cost to have it managed for you and decreasing your profit. Not necessarily a lot. You can do it in good margins, and I'll get into that right here. So, marketing the I'm just going to bucket these in three very simple ways. There are more than this, and don't [ __ ] on me for that. There. I'm just going to say marketing, sales, and fulfillment because it's simple and that's what we're going to use. Okay? Okay. And those are the three core buckets that I'm going to use on my opinion. So, marketing, organic versus paid. Now, ours is 95% paid. Okay. Now, when you have paid, you have a large cost or a cost, not necessarily large or depending how you how you run it is uh either percentage large, but organic. Now, all of these [ __ ] guy, not all, a lot of these [ __ ] guys, a lot of these things, these guys, they get to a couple hundred grand a month, they are able to do that strictly on like a warm audience on following they have built on either X, on Instagram, on YouTube or wherever, and they don't need to run ads. Now, why that is good is because in your units and in your overall P&L, your marketing expense, sorry if I'm glitching, it's because you don't subscribe and because I haven't swapped to my new laptop yet. I'm sorry. But um the organic versus paid. Paid is a large size. So when you hear people talk about rorowaz and it's 2x or it's 5x. It's like that is how much you spent on ads to how much you returned from ads which generally speaking is like a majority of your revenue if you're doing it. Not necessarily but like it could be 20% it could be 40% of your revenue and it directly eats into how much profit you have okay or your cash collected. So in this model we're going to talk about this real quick. So, acquisition funnel, this is a very simple VSSL opt-in funnel. And this is the math behind it. So, let's say you get a lead for $30. Of that, of those people who opt in to watch your VSSL, 20% of them apply. Of the people that apply, 50% of them book a call. So, now it cost you $300 to get someone on the phone. Then, 55% of them show up for the for the call. So, it cost you $545 to get a live call. And then you close 25% of them. It cost you $2,000. $2,200 actually to get a new purchaser. Okay. Now, if that person is paying you $8,000, which is not crazy high in the high ticket space, but like definitely more than your $27 ebook, $8,000 over the phone because it's that high of ticket. Generally speaking, and I'm going to get into that in these, generally speaking, that means that you need to pay a sales rep because you are not because you're using a sales team. Now, this is that time versus money thing. I'm going to continue to go back and forth with if you are taking the calls, you do not have a cost for it other than your time. Okay? Now, in this model, I just said 55% of them show up. So, you now have blocked off, we'll use 50 on this so it's easy, but like two hours of your time. Let's say only one showed up. And really what it is is one in four of the live calls. So, you had to take eight calls roughly to get this one unit. So, you just spent eight hours to get one unit and make eight grand in cash collected. Then you spent two grand on ads, which netted you $6,000, assuming that there is no sales team because you did it. And the fulfillment is all your time as well. So, you just made six G's in eight hours roughly, let's call it, based on how long you took on sales calls. Now, you have to fulfill on this and coach with them. And what is your hourly rate? So, let right like now you spent the eight hours here. How many hours are you going to spend to work with the person and get them the result of why they're paying you? And we're going to go through the different models of fulfillment versus the sales versus the marketing. It it can get spread out. And if you're running an ecom business, if you're running a like any of these other things, it's like why are you doing that? So most people are not going to be if you're that small and if you're in that model, you're not going to have metrics like this because you're not going to be running paid. So in this what what would happen with an organic and someone like Eman talks about it how they have 70% margins on their net net net like not gross like their net margin is 70% which is like on 70 million which is just nutty. So for them it's going to be a zero ad cost. Okay. Because and it's not actually zero because if you want to account for it the right way or whatever it's like how much do you pay your team to actually do the content or even if you're doing the content like what's the time cost on that? But in literal dollars of this, if you're not including team that you pay to do it or you just pump out all your own content, an organic sale does not have any ad cost or marketing cost directly. Okay. Sales team, this one can vary, but like we'll call it 10%. And fulfillment, depending on the model, which we'll get into, it's 10%. So that's where you're making your 80% here. And then another 10% goes to your overhead that is lean as can be and you're making 70% margins. Okay, now that's the difference on the organic versus the paid. So being able to do it with an audience. Now the thing there is if you do not have consistency in growth of the audience through organic methods, it you would like to depend on paid to scale. The thing with paid is it is consistent. Organic can be consistent for sure depending on like content outputs and like knowing your numbers on what where you sit on like engagement rates and um conversion rates of different pieces of your organic audience. Um but that's just like a general gist. Now sales direct versus over the phone. A lot of people cap it at 2K. I have, you know, I mean, I personally bought stuff up to 15 grand without talking to somebody. So like what I mean here on sales is direct versus phone. So a lot of people will sell something that is $297, call it. Oops. $297, call it. They have no sales team because they're selling direct. So what I mean by this is like either running ads or organic. All these can be interchangeable. You can have an organic phone funnel that only does community or this. And you could do a paid funnel that does phone that does direct but does like like there's these different options. So, we're mixing and matching. I'm trying to give you examples. So, the phone version is on a sales team. You would not sell it this low. You could not sell it this low because the math in order to sell something over the phone on just just a 20 $297 unit doesn't make sense for how much you then would be able to pay a sales rep because on average you're going to pay a sales rep 10%. When you are using an outsource agency it's 20% to pay a sales agency and that's why you're using high ticket and when you're running it in-house you're going to call it 15 to 17. So we'll just throw 17 in here. Okay. Now, with direct, there's no sales team and the fulfillment is dependent on these different models down here. Okay? But like, let's say it's zero. You're basically making all this because you organically sold somebody. You posted on in your community or on your Facebook or I'm sorry on your on your Facebook on your uh Instagram or inside your on YouTube and a thousand people bought this thing and you didn't have to spend any money in ads. You didn't have to sell anyone over the phone on a sales team and the fulfillment cost you basically nothing because you're selling a community. So you essentially just made 297 per pop and then the only thing is then the cost to fulfill on it which is either your time one to many in a community or you pay a coach or someone for community management plus a little bit of you. And that's how a lot of these guys in that model works for the WP communities uh for the Discords for the different things like that is it's the collection of people. It's a direct to cart so you don't have to talk to anyone on the phone. So fulfillment is extremely low. There's little to no ads at all and there's no sales team. So that is how they can basically only have overhead thereafter which is how much they pay the lean team. The fulfillment is you know one to 5% call it with like course uh with uh community managers things like that. But that's the gist. Okay. So direct first phone. Now if you're selling something over the phone uh what example do we use 8,000 and you're selling it organic your sales team like I said we're going to use the in-house number. 17% of it that includes managers that includes setters that includes everything. A normal sales rep's 10ish, call it maybe 10 to 12. W2 add 20%. Manager add two three points. Uh setter basically the same cap 2 to three plus two. So like you can get up to 17 to 20 real quick. And then I specifically know agencies that either do it for 20 or 25 of the net new rev. Okay. Fulfillment. Now if you are selling for something for $8,000, fulfillment's next on this. But on average for service, you're going to keep it under 20%. Okay? And this is an the example of you. It's organic. You posted. You went through this to get someone onto the phone. They booked in. And then it cost $1,300 to pay a commission to a sales rep and the whole team. And it cost you $1,600 to the coach, the community manager, the people on the background that are fulfilling on it. Now, again, this is at scale when you have like a big business because normally this is going to be like way lower because it's either your time that you're selling for $8,000 or like group time and it's still just like extremely limited. So again, pretty solid margins. Next, fulfillment. Two different types of things that exist here. So like education industry-ish is info coaching. I'm simplifying and this is my interpretation. So info is going to be like your consumable. So a lot of people will sell a course, a community or like group. Okay? And that's and a lot of the time it's all of them. So you'll get login access to a group where you have like trainings and education to learn the thing. You have a community that goes side by side to ask questions about it and like as you go through the course material and then you have group coaching calls which are like that little bit of personalization to have Q&A that's not like a support inbox. I know people who just sell course. I know people who just sell community. I know people who just sell course plus community with no calls. I know people who just sell calls. Like you can interchange these however you want. And you need to be able to make sure you do your math on what it's going to cost you fulfill because a course cost you b literally nothing the time to do it. Okay. And then the hosting cost of Kajjabi or wherever you use or school. Community is going to cost you your time and then either you're going to upgrade people from the community to manage it or you're going to pay a community manager to do it. And then group coaching is either going to be your time one to many which is extremely scalable to a pretty high range or you are going to pay a coach to do the group coaching calls which is also one to many. So still you're paying one person x amount of time for many people. All right. Now, next piece of this, and again, all that in to keep the math up to date in this $8,000 example, an organic sale, a sales team that happened because it's a higher ticket thing. You couldn't sell it direct. I have bought things for more than 15 grand just with an order form. So, not saying it can't be done, but generally speaking, over 2K, you're going to be selling it um you're going to be selling it over the phone. So, you're gonna have a sales team. So, let's put the sales team here. And all these things I was referring to are either zeroing this out if it's just like a login access it. And then if you have group coach, you have to pay a community manager, whatever, it's 2%, it's 5% depending on the volume. Because $160 is not what you're paying the person. You're paying the person 40 grand or 26 grand or whatever number you're paying them. And then it's spread out across however much volume you are doing per unit. Okay? That per unit decreases if the person is making a flat fee. If the person is making 2% of every person that comes in, it stays 2%. Okay, hopefully that makes sense. Now, fulfillment in coaching, there are four different layers here. And you have coaching that is onetoone. So that is someone who is paying you $50,000 or $10,000 to literally work with you directly. Now, in that model, someone's paying you 50 grand. Oops. Generally speaking, there is no ad cost on this or it's later in a funnel that already happened. So, it's like the p top of the of the uh funnel of like or the ascension ladder. It's the top. So, you've already liquidated ad costs. So, zero ad costs. A sales team likely is happening or they're talking to you directly to buy. So, it's either 15% or zero. And then fulfillment in terms of actual dollars is zero. Okay. When it's one to one. Now, this is a massive time suck. And in the direct answering of what someone was posting about, I was like, "How do you guys do onetoone coaching? Like, I feel like I could do that, but I just don't have the time." It's like, yeah, exactly. So, are you going to trade off making 200 grand and feeling the indebtedness because someone paid you 50 racks to want to then to try and help them get the result they want? And the reason they're paying you 50 is to make more than 50 in whatever value exchange. Whether that's literal in terms of monetary, they pay you 50 cuz they want to make 200 or they pay you 50 because it's going to change their health or their relationships or their whatever. Like if you do not get them the result, not a good thing. Okay? So like you're going to put x amount of time into this to make sure they do it and that is going to distract you back to our focus thing from your main business where you're making money in physical e-commerce or as a yoga practitioner or as a or like you know or scaling whatever. Okay? Okay? So, it's going to take away your time because you're going to be focused on helping these people do it in exchange for $50,000. Okay? Like, simply put, that is what you are doing. So, that's a one one example, and that's where someone is going to pay you the highest dollar value in your ladder. And there are other like kind of offshoot things, but like in this example, we're just going to use these four. The one is the peak of the pyramid. you can charge the most amount of money and people are paying the most amount of money because they have access to you and they have the highest likelihood of getting the result versus if they buy a $27 ebook that you produce, they do not think they're going to get the personalization, the one-on-one, the the likelihood of them being able to follow through on it or the value of how they look at it is $27 versus how they look at something that is $50,000. Okay. Now, next one too many. So, this is changing the fulfillment style as well as the offer. So in this you are doing group coaching okay and in that let's say you can charge 25,000 not $25 you can charge $25,000 okay or what's more realistic is maybe a 12k program and again these there's so many depths to this this is this is six-month range is this you know some of these big guys charge $1820 or whatever for six-month access right now and it's a group and it's coaching calls that are mixed with group and the person and it is a community and like that's it. I think I said the same thing once but like and there's like a little teeny course that's attached to it and they charge 20 grand and it's a six-month thing because everyone focus on recurring now which I'll get into later but one to many the difference here is somebody is now going on and they have to like bid for your time. Now whether this is in community or this is on live calls in this example I'm talking about live calls. So now instead of you doing oneto ones with this person and only having your time one hour to their one hour where they're trading 50 grand like people like Cardone I've heard have charged like 200 grand or 250 for like three hours. I don't remember the exact number so don't quote that but it was definitely over 100 and it was per call it was it was I'm pretty sure it was over 100 per call maybe 180 for two I don't know something like that but it's high and that is for uh coaching direct consulting calls because people can pay that because they think they're going to make or they know they're going to make and that's the thing they the highest likelihood that they are going the highest likelihood of result that they're going to make more than 100 grand from the hour of what they learn on the one to one piece the next for this one to many is them getting on a call where there's 15 or is there 40 or is there 200 people that are all going to you one to many instead of one to one where they are trying to get their same result but they know they have to bid for the attention. They're asking questions in the box like yes it's you answering but is it onetoone? Is it direct communication and feedback? No, it's not. Or are they in a group chat where you will answer but they're also answering a bunch of other people versus onetoone texting someone. So it's different. The value is perceived different. You can charge less money. Okay. Keeping everything the same. No ads, no sales, no fulfillment. Okay. Now, coach onetoone. This is where instead of having you do this, you have coaches. So, your coaches do a one-to-one call with them. Um, and this is generally speaking also a little bit lower. And we're using like the true expert model here because at scale on like a real business that runs this, and not to say they're not real businesses, anything that you know, whatever. It's not they are real businesses, but the ones that are at scale already are at these models. And I'll show you an examples of that. But a coach onetoone generally this is like when you're pumping you're doing a lot of these there's no way that you are doing one to one. So instead of you doing one to one you have coaches doing oneto ones and you have 10 coaches or 50 coaches that do this and they go onetoone and that is the next tier down on the ladder where they'll pay pay nine grand for six-month access where they get onetoone attention from a coach and they get all these other things. They get the course, they get the community, they get the coaching, but they get onetoone with a coach. Again, highest likelihood they're going to get the result. they're cool with it. Now, the next on the ladder is one to many, and that is a group coaching style again, but where the coach is the person instead of you as the expert of the person, which then can be broken into cohorts and pods, and you can have one group, one group coach with 10 people in it instead of one coach with one person on it. Okay? So, you see as we're tiering down this that is call it three grand. I'm just using examples on this. We're just dropping it as we scale down because that is the how the value is perceived of these and the likelihood to get the result drops as you do this. But eventually there's like a floor and that's where kind of these numbers land and it's dependent on your industry, your space. If you're, you know, in yoga like I said versus dog versus like make money online, vastly different dollars because it's what your market is, where they value it and what the return is, the ROI justification either emotionally or literally in terms of dollars. So now I'm going to give you an example of at scale how this looks. So let's say for our program we're charging 8 grand. The ad cost is this number up here. Sales team is actually 17% let's call it an inside team and fulfillment is 20%. What this is is someone is paying for a onetoone coach where they also get community. They're paying for onetoone coach for six months or a year let's just say. Okay. So, they're paying $8,000. We are using all paid advertising to do this and spending large sums of money a day to consistently acquire clients because we do not have an organic pool. So, it's costing us $2,200 to get a customer. It is then costing us $1360 in sales, sales management, setter, whatever. And then it's costing us $1,600 to pay this coach that does onetoone work. Okay. Now, gross profit on that is 35%. So, you make $2,800 of that 8 grand in this example. Now, I don't know about you, but as you scale up a team and go through 35% gross before overhead, before software, your marketing team, your all the pieces that do not fit into either your ads, your sales team or overall sales or your fulfillment team. Everything else that happens in your business is an overhead expense in simple math or simple in this example. Okay? It's going to be generally speaking. you're gonna need a lot of units or you're going to want to increase that percent because you're only making 2000 bucks 2,800 bucks of that 8,000 or you have other offerings or you have these other things but like I'm just giving you an example of selling one offering in this. Okay, now people who have done this I hope this all makes sense. Um I just yapped for 24 minutes and it's just so important to understand like the differences in these and how the percents or the the pieces like cuz if you don't have paid you you know you could save 30 points off this, right? If your ads are that, it's almost 30%. So you drop 30% to the gross profit line and then that water falls down. If you do paid, now you know if you do direct versus phone, phone teams, you know, are going to cost 15%, 10%, 20% depending on the number. The fulfillment, this is going to have little to no cost to fulfill. This is going to have a lot of time to fulfill. And this is going to have a lot of cost to fulfill. It's like what's the tradeoff? So like should you start one or not? Yeah, go ahead spin one up. like you're going to lose focus on what you're actually doing if you're doing something big and if you you should be doing this. The only people I think should be doing this are people who are experts who are already doing something big anyway. So, it's a cash flow game. You can easily make a couple hundred grand a month doing this. FYI, but ways to 100x this talked about this and what something actually sells. He sold his and he talked about this literally in a podcast yesterday. So, I'm like directly ripping this. So, shout out him. I watch all of his [ __ ] I'm like it's perfect. Uh it fits how my mind thinks. So for him, the whole point is like recurring value and that's what that's the part that sells. So like why people come back. Um so in this model that 8K, let's say is the six-month membership and people are obsessed with it. It's like the best thing ever. They need it. They get the one to one touch point. It's what helps them get the result because that's what they're paying for and they want to do it forever. And you know your turn 15% and you keep most people and you have a constant inflow. Like that's valuable because it's recurring because future cash flow is predictable. Okay. Now, what's valuable in the examples he gave? I'm literally pulling this from his podcast. I listened to the plane home yesterday. He talks about how like there's like hot lists like so different things in like real estate or different things in um like he used another example of like you know product blueprints or something where people can like basically the like the creation portion of a p of a business model. Those coming out recurring are what people continue to pay for. It's like they're having a subscription to get access to new information that comes in. So, same thing people do with like uh financial newsletters and like updates on markets or whatever. They pay for that data and that information and that's why it's valuable is because it's consistently you can you can predict that that cash flow is going to be into the future because people are consistently paying for it because the product is valuable and it refreshes itself which inherently makes the recurring aspect as well. Okay. Ads another one. And so when he talked about the gym launch example, he was talking about how they were refreshing, they were basically testing, launching, and uh, you know, validating ads and then they were like launching them inside the thing. And same thing, it's like it's consumable. So like those ones die, new ones come out and they're giving it to the community. And that community is paying X amount for recurring month over month to get new access to that, you know, the what's working now essentially of ads. And likely, you know, I don't know his business model or what it was, but like he [ __ ] crushed it, so like doesn't matter. But you know the nine other things that he was offering them that were refreshing and education and access and all those things. So they sold for whatever 40 million 50 million something like that. So what's valuable and then the bigger game of this is let's say this is okay. Let's say it's kind of a distraction. You make a couple hundred grand a month which is like fine and it does you know a little bit of time distraction. You keep working on your main thing. Generally speaking that's not the case. Here are three examples of people who are doing this that are both making money on this and also crushing it with a bigger backend. Okay, private equity. I know a guy that's doing this with like operations and different pieces of that that is running an info coaching offer is doing great numbers in gross profit, net profit and now it just needs to focus on scaling it and on the front end uh which is the paid side versus the organic because there's not a community. So there's going to be ad expense there and then has to hire sales team because it's high enough ticket that has to be over the phone and then the fulfillment is very dialed because he already has that. So it's like 5%. Okay. So the bigger play there though is let's say he makes 30% net on the entire company and does a million bucks makes 300K. The bigger play is those customers are then people he wants to actually buy their businesses into the future. And when he buys their businesses depending on how he scales and does and sells it for later or the cash flow like it's a 100x play. So like the info coaching is a feeder to a bigger business model that's into the future. Life insurance I know a guy who basically I know two different or three different actually uh people who did this but they sell a course it's like on money management on like wealth preservation on retirement like there's these different angles to do it because life insurance has different angles of why people do it and different messaging points on why people would do it. They sell the stuff. They make some money or even no money on the info on getting them in. And then they all end up buying insurance on the back end, which is a high highly commissionable depending depending there's different commission ranges, highly commissionable product. So they make all of their money on the actual being an insurance agent and they float it and do acquisition through insurance uh or I'm sorry through info and coaching. And they do make money there actually. And then they have clout and like brand name and all that. And then they make the most of their money on that. And then there's 19 other ways to extend LTV through referrals and whatever. But just as an example, all this bigger game is just like increasing the back end. Um, Hyros, they talked about this, but Becker, you know, shut down his info coaching and his other stuff to run Hyros, but he also like we bought it uh a course he was selling that was like a Trojan horse of he made money on it for sure, uh, like in the info coaching business and then was basically pushing everyone to use Hyros and all talked about Hyros when it was newer and we bought it and it was great software. So like no nothing bad about that. Um but that was exactly what that was. It was like a feeder. It was he was doing info coaching to cash flow I'm sure both cash flow the actual business and like starting the business as well as then get new customers into the software and platform that were directly in market and then those you know Hyros took off. He sold that thing for nine figures like or a portion of it or whatever. So it works. It works. Um and yeah I this was I didn't even realize this 30 minutes long. Um, I hope you understand the concepts of what I'm getting across here. And like I do these videos cuz it helps me understand more. And every time I do this, I'm like, "Okay, how could I do this better?" And when I think through these numbers and talk these out loud, I'm like, "Oh, that's 17. Like what if that was 13?" Or like, "What if the closing was 35% on average?" Like that kind of stuff is huge and at scale it makes a big big difference. So hopefully this was helpful. Sorry this is like a yap session of 31 minutes. Um, daily update. I'm back in the cave and I will be here for a long time. www.ryanclog.com/docck has all the videos I've made. That video of all of us just shooting the [ __ ] at the event in Dallas has the most views on my entire channel, which is just kind of like hilarious. Uh, and I think the most likes. So, yeah, we're just building. I have some fun updates coming soon, but I'm inking them before I talk about them. And yeah, so new laptop. I got to figure out how to back the other one up and do all that stuff and migrate that over. But I appreciate you guys as always. Hopefully I didn't yap too hard. Please give me some feedback on that. I could have been more direct with this and had this done in like 5 minutes, but it would not have been as in-depth or many examples or things. But maybe that's what better. So let me know and hit me on IG or X for communication. Talk soon.
