# Cole Gordon's Multi 8-Figure Sales Empire (Full Breakdown) | EP112
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlyKO6z4bww

Yes. What's up, guys? We are on episode 112 days in a row and we've got Cole Gordon. I have sat in the crowd while he speak has spoken has spoken before. I have Oh, yeah. Many a time. I have bought his programs. We have used his stuff and I've watched all his content. So, this is a big one. So, Cole, who are you for the people? I'm excited. Yeah. So, basically, you know, closes.io. So, first started off as like a sales coaching trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Got that to 100 grand a month. Then basically we had a B TOC which was training sales reps and our B2B which is the main company placing sales reps doing sales teams stuff like that and I was just telling you earlier took that from 100 grand to 2.5 million a month in a course of a year and then from there got it to 4 million a month then did we can talk about this if you want to you know when everybody started doing whole codes and all that stuff I'm like I want to do the hold co started like taking on all these portfolio clients got distracted then let go those go scaled a medical business at 3 million a month and then let that go and then now I'm back to now I'm back to just the basics right so that's kind of like the journey in in one sentence but it is three multiple eight figure companies at least that's my that's my track record I guess got the receipts he's got the receipts yeah no I seriously I I'm trying to remember what the conference was but we were at I think it was what's Stephan Georgie's thing oh copy accelerator you know what that was the worst talk I've ever given why would you say I don't know why I don't know why it was like I always give that talk, but it's like for whatever reason you I don't know how much you've spoken on stage, but like there's certain times where the room is so dark and the lights coming at you were so bright I was blinded and like I couldn't see anybody and so I was like I think everybody [ __ ] hates me and so I just like I'm like over there in the corner like viciously taking notes. Yeah. And also it was this old it was this old present I mean it it's cut I don't do the same one anymore. I have a different one, but at the time like you create a presentation and if you go and speak at masterminds, you you basically give the same presentation. And I hadn't I hadn't done that one in like a year. And so I didn't like rehearsed it at all. I just was like, ah, [ __ ] it. I'm just going to go up there and just riff it. And like, you know, it it's like you're going through it and you're kind of like, ah, you know, like [ __ ] like this point I kind of don't even agree with anymore. So you kind of get in your head. I remember thinking like that was the last time I gave that talk. I was like, [ __ ] this talk. And I also didn't like speak after that for like so funny. I was like I was like it it was I felt some people said it was fine. I was like I walked out of there like that was the worst talk I've ever given. You know like that was how I felt at that time. That's crazy. Yeah. We randomly went to it like I I don't even remember how we just got that one ticket. We never joined the full mastermind. Luke and I went flew out there and then we we met Eddie there for the first time because we had never before that. Um you you spoke vicious amounts of notes from that because we were scaling. That's when we went from like one to three at that time, like in that range. And then Josh Snow, we met Josh Snow for the first time like in person with him then went to his mastermind in Denver and like did all that stuff like all within a 90day range. So I thought it was good for all okay. I was blind, dude. I couldn't see I could see one guy and I was like I'm just going to give this presentation to this one guy, you know, cuz their room was so [ __ ] dark, dude. That's hilarious. Um, no. So yeah, I mean the hold code transformation, the info coaching, the you had multiple hold codes that you were doing, you're like I watch all your content. So I mean I got to remember the name of that video, but the one where you're talking about how you expanded out and then now a million a month and shut it down. I need to make a part two of that. You want to know the part two? Yes, I would love to. So So the part one, this is this is a recent thing. So the part one is like just for people who didn't watch the video. It's like okay I had a B2B and then I you know I I wouldn't recommend this for most people but I just had the right people in the right time and also like you know with our B2B there's like a sales training component there's like a business owner component and a sales team component and then there's done for you recruiting and account manager and etc. So we were scaling that but then the sales training you know I knew I could split that off and and kind of have it as its own program for people who wanted to get into sales. So we we kind of scaled these two companies simultaneously and again like it was like 100 grand a month to 2.5 in in a year which was insane. And then the next by the by the beginning of what it would have been 2023 uh I never got to four but I did do like three dude I did 3.97 like five months in a row you know or not it well not not 3.97 but it was like 3.97 3.93 3.97 3.96 3.97 it just I could not [ __ ] break this 400 grand or uh four 4 million but then that's when I started you know essentially you know Hermosi was like taking equity people whole co was all over like Twitter and like I took a whole co course and then I basically uh took my talk and my team was really about it too and I was like I don't know this might be a distraction but then they were talking to me into it then I started talking myself into it so we took equity in eight clients and the thing was is that basically what happened is we took equity in eight clients and we were taking like 20 to 50% or sorry at the at the beginning it was like 20 to 33%. And so at first we were like we're just going to do their sales team. So we would do their sales team and then like quickly the constraint would be like they can't scale with marketing. So we were like [ __ ] it we're going to do their marketing too because we had really good systems for that. So then we were doing their like basically running half their business for like 20% in some cases. So then we were like okay. And and they were essentially like some of them went from like you know 150 or 200 to 300. So all everybody grew. It wasn't like anybody like was like a disaster or anything. Like everybody grew, but like I was like, "Dude, we're like making like 150,000 a month profit off of this." And I feel like we're running like three eight like this thing is like three eight figure companies and then we have our other companies over here. And so out of all of those, what happened was the only one that really had exit value or that was like truly scalable to 9 figures if not more was like a uh it was basically a medical clinic and they had like one location. So then we started expanding out the locations and I was like, "Dude, we should just cut everything and go all in on this." Like just put all of our resources to this and then so we took that from 50k a month in one location to 3 million a month in six locations in like 14 months I think it was. So like just nuclear growth. The problem was is we scaled it so fast that you know operationally there was a ton of struggles and then long story short for you know some reasons that probably I shouldn't uh say publicly I was just like I'm going to basically leave this. It just became too much risk for me honestly and I was like I'm going to go all the way back to this just the one company. But throughout that I shut down the B TOC. So I kind of went from like three companies down to two and then unintentionally down to one. And so now I'm kind of building back up the B TOC. But here's part two. So like in in part one the kind of the the point was is I was like I'm going to do you know hormone says focus okay like I'm going to like focus one thing I'm going to like so I came in that like this past year cuz I basically made that shift last June. So this whole past year I essentially was like all in on one company and focusing on like different initiatives and different like um you know like launching a sponsorship initiative and like this new funnel with this new sales team and like this new business division and this new profit center and I it was the first time I've had one company since like 2020. And so I have like all this energy. I changed so much [ __ ] and launched so much [ __ ] that you know what happened? Like I just blew everything up. And so I didn't like [ __ ] up the top line, but I just immediately like tanked my profit. Like I overhired people. I overexpanded because I was like so [ __ ] eager to get back to where I was. And what I've kind of learned is like once things are at a critical mass and like you have really good leaders and like you have good operators and like you have a good like system and and you know there's enough diversification, there's more than one funnel, it can still grow, but like you can't just blow it up overnight. Like you kind of got to just improve and keep doing what you're doing. And honestly, like you know, that's why I'm bringing back the B TOC is because like we definitely have the capabilities to do it. And just from a cost structure, it really helps profitability when you can have shared services, multiple things. So like that's kind of like the part two of what I've learned if that makes sense. But I kind of overcorrected and then overorrected back and now I'm kind of trying to find the middle ground. Yeah. No, it completely makes sense. I just uh got off an interview right before this and I literally sent it into payroll and then I said last hire said no more hires until 5 million a month and I did the last like that's it and it's a project manager role because we have so many talented people we have so much that's sitting there and like it'll take five people six days in one thread to make a decision on something or to like follow through on a project that I'm like like so many talented but the management like project structure and like efficiency is just not there and I'm like we're done hiring like we're literally done hiring for overhead the only things I can hire are coaching setters and closers. Like that's it. Only those can scale like as rev scales, but like everything else stays. And no, that's that's uh the whole co thing is funny you say that like on on X and on wherever it was hot for a minute. Real. Yeah. I mean it it's it's look like you can make it work but you really have to have people like the reason why when I scaled those two companies originally really quickly. The reason why it did work so well is I had two people who basically ran uh I had one CMO and then I had two people who ran the sales and fulfillment for both and then I had a CFO in operations who ran sales and fulfillment for both. So it's like I had like the two people what I mean they didn't do both. What they did is essentially they were like CRO of one and CRO of the other. So if you think about it like I had an extra company but I only really had one extra direct report. Yeah. So if you can't do that then you shouldn't do multiple things. So like even when I'm bringing this B toc back I'm really only adding one direct report and the rest is on the existing infrastructure. So like that's kind of how you have to do it and and most people I think they they do too many things. they don't have that that there and you know that's that's why it's a struggle but it's hard right the reason it's a huge opportunity and it's a multiple nine figure opportunity is because it's really [ __ ] hard 100% yeah I mean we were talking before this we jammed for a while and I never did that it's hilarious but uh you you said a couple names we don't have to say them but some of the guys that are in you know over 10 million a month in info coaching and those guys have like behemoth teams and but beyond that like I think you are definitely marginwise I I don't know anyone else that did kind of your your numbers and did it with that kind of margin for x amount of time. Like extreme kudos to you. I I really don't. Yeah. I mean, my margins have always been good and honestly I didn't even realize um I mean there's definitely people who have made more. Um and I know even you know with what Hermosi is doing now. I mean, God knows what numbers he's doing, but I know how that guy rolls and I'm sure he's banking massive profits off of those events and then the upsells to the events old co. I mean, that's like a stratus. Like, if I'm if I'm here, he's like off the freaking screen. Like, it's insane. But yeah, I mean, our profit margins are good. I think the the people who are bigger than us are definitely a combination of it's all B TOC and then the the big things that really help people scale is when they have a really good liquidating front end andor if you're B2B, you have to it's hard to get liquidating front ends for B2B. I'm trying to work on that right now. But for B2B, what really helps us is we just have a massive back end. I mean, we we've had clients that have worked with us for five years. Yeah. It's amazing, you know, and like we we have the ability with the recruiting and stuff to do like more real business services. So, like you can actually have like an integrated kind of contract with the company and it's like ongoing. So that's kind of how it looks like you have to have either with B TOC the front end and if you if you look at all the companies I'm sure you know that have done 50 to 100 plus they all have fantastic frontends because with B TOC the issue is is that at the call funnel is good to get to and you guys have scaled yours pretty far but like most people like most of my clients 400 to a million a month the call funnel starts to like lot of bad quality you're super overreantiant on setters calling the opt-ins um you It's like it just kind of like tons of no-shows, the show rates like [ __ ] tough. And so when you add in like a front end like kind of what like you know um I know you work with Blake and like what he's kind of doing uh for companies like yours and such. When you add that in there, that's what really helps the scale for the B2B. You can get away with the call funnel much longer, but you have to have a good back end because you know our CAS could be four grand and it's like still ripping tons of profit. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah. Yeah, I mean like we do like last month we did 2.5 new which is callfunnel essentially. Like we do have a low ticket but we can't get it above 50 to 100 units a day right now because it's not built for like cold scale. So like that's one of the things we're working on is like a low ticket one that can scale to hundreds of units which there's people in the space as a great example. Some of the ones we talked about that that's all they do. It has to go through there in order to get through the back. Um the economics on it are great after it's just getting the net CPA there. But yeah, it's funny you say that because it's like our back end. So 2.5 we did three last month. was basically half a million came from backend roughly and that's payment plans and renewals and it's like this like we never built for that. It was always just this hamster wheel and you can see and feel profit like I'm pretty open about being like hey we're below like last year when we did x amount we did below good online business margins which good business margins for online 2530 right like on average call it like really good ones um and we were below that by far so or not by far but what do you think about the I've seen a big shift in health companies moving to kind of like a hybrid health coaching tele medicine type of deal yeah we have something you guys thought about that Yeah, our thing is like we're going to try and break the norm and try and be an outlier and do the the exit. We're going to try and do it and in order to do so, we need not to do partnerships as much. It needs to be in-house. It needs to be all these things. So, like if you had a partnership with a supplement company as an example, like physical true like, you know, supplements this way, like it's just not there the same it is if you actually have it, but then you have the whole infrastructure of doing it. So, kind of what you said earlier is like if we can have one core person in house that like runs that, I'm down. But as soon as like everyone's kind of mixed bagging it and it's doing this thing like you can do the efficiencies and like have the you know economies of scale style model. But if you don't and it's like a distraction it just breaks everything else over here that's already kind of like thin because ours I mean we we don't have an offering really before the onetoone coaching. So really that is the front end and it's crazy because like the math works on it to get the profit but like not enough to have these massive 30 40 50% margins. is like we're just not there until either we get to size because we could technically if we ramped enough volume because of the overhead right breaks through but like the units are there it's it's just all backend so we just rolled out a group coaching back end we're talking the tele medicine stuff we're talking like all those right now because you know 40 to 60% of our customers I'm forget the numbers either 40 or 60 are using those things already on their own yeah so it's like yeah I I think the big the big plays is is liquidating as much of the ad spend as you can I mean that's so the Nice thing about B TOC is it's like B TOC is built to be able to do those low ticket front ends really well. B2B is like it's tough. I mean it's hard to get anything to work to B2B, especially if you market to coaches. That'd be like the worst market ever. Um but B2B is tough. B TOC the the front ends are really important. And then yeah, I've like played around with like you know obviously I'm not in the health space uh at least anymore, but I've thought about a lot like your space and how I would do it if I did it. And like I've played around with the idea of like, okay, you have a medical director and then you you bring people in and then you pay for their blood work. And if you think about like in my mind, blood work is the best discovery of all time. Like your discovery through the sales call is built in. And so you just you literally just explain what it is, what's off, okay, here's the problems with what's off, and why those could be potential issues down the road. And then like, okay, like here's what you want to do if you want to fix it. And and I feel like adding the clinical feeling to it and it becoming more than just weight loss and it's more like holistic health, disease prevention, etc. And you can be able to have like a doctor write the script and then obviously you can look at like supplements or uh peptides, you know, etc., etc., etc. Could be an interesting 10x theirs. And there I mean there's the saliva one. They crushed and got to very large numbers. I mean they had their whole thing they had happen but like them the other company we talked about they do the same thing. So it's like they that's their initial front end is selling a test kit, right? do that back and it's a consultation call and it's like here all it's exactly what we were saying discovery wise to push them over to this and then it's coaching it's supplements it's peptide it's all the different backend things and you look at some of those LT LTVs like I follow a bunch of media buyer and like affiliate lead genen guys and they'll go to these charts that are like LTV to CAC ratios and people just the LTV is just literally unknown because people do do not get off TRT they do not get off HRT they do not get off these peptides like in the amount of time they've tracked this it's like just continuing up into the right. So yeah, but yeah, I think it's an interesting opportunity because the thing is too with the tele medicine companies, a lot of those people who are running like the semigluide type offers, they are doing like a CAC payback period of like three or four months or whatever it is, if they're good with if they're more DR oriented, they're maybe like a month or two or break even on the front end like but you know a lot of people like the company I get some of my stuff from, they're literally I think like three or four month uh payback period and they've raised like so much money and it's like I I I feel like there's going to be a good marrying of kind of the high ticket direct response. It's like the high ticket space, direct response pace with the tele medicine. If somebody knows how to do that, well, they could just rip it. Yeah, I agree. That's definitely in the in the cards. I want to talk to you about the I don't even know what you call it like almost like marketplace business model that you ran for a minute or like or I guess not you don't if you don't have the B2C style but like that was so interesting to me cuz I was kind of halfbaked in this current role and in this situation like I was doing a lot of the tech infrastructure stuff but like I was a smaller piece of the pie. It was growing it up into the right and like didn't really take a lot of my time. So I was talking to these lead genen guys and building this over here and this and I was like what could I stand up that would be on my own and I was like I know this marketing tech systems ops things really well and I was like what if and I think actually Ravi ended up coming up uh coming out with an offer that was very similar. Yeah. Yeah. I gave him the idea people how to be like marketing tax have I gave him I gave him that idea. I didn't I didn't do anything else. He did everything else. I just I was like you should do this. Yeah. So like how does that one my best friends I really like Ruby so Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've never met him but yeah. I mean I've followed his stuff forever. Yeah, I feel like I think very similar to how he does like he's very obviously scaling the systems. But by the way, I'll just give you a little You should interview him next. But RV is the type of guy who'll like I'll be like RVY like why did you pick this apartment to live in? And dude, he will give you the most like Yeah. He's like I Well, my assistant has like a He's like my assistant has a 27 point checklist. So already she built a list of like 250 people. She called all the people and she was like like and then she filtered it down to this and then we did this and and it's like the most systems he he really is like the systems guy. I'm like I'm not like that at all. I mean I am to a degree but like not not to his level but he's one of my my good pals. Yeah. So like so how does I mean you stopped running it but like how is that business model? It sounds on paper amazing or like if you think it's like you have acquisition here and then you get paid for the person again. Yeah. So it's interesting. Um, it doesn't really work how people think it think it did. So, let's just use common sense for a second. If you're selling a bisop or like a B TOC, hey, become a sales rep, okay? And then on the other side, you have people paying you a bunch of money for good sales reps. Like, that doesn't really line up. Like, I'm not going to be able to like if you pay me a bunch of money to place you with a rep, I can't give you somebody who just used to be a bus driver, you know? Like I'm happy to help the bus driver get into sales and go out and apply for a position or something, but like I can't place that person. So realistic, this is a big misunderstanding about my business is people really thought it was all built off a two-sided marketplace. That's it's not it's not true and it really never was. At the at the very peak, maybe 20% of all placements. So like we placed,00 sales reps last year, probably,00 the year before, 1,000 or whatever. Uh I mean it's pretty that it's been pretty at that level for a while. Only about 20% at the peak and in some months it was 10% was from that program and out of that percentage 80 90% were like DM setters or setters where like the business owners like yeah just give me somebody entry level. And so most of all of our recruiting comes from essentially we have 16 full cycle recruiters. they do like actual recruiting like LinkedIn. Okay, I'm going to try to find somebody who's you know um who's sold something similar to you. Get them to We didn't always have a good full cycle for the outbound function, but last year or so that's really like taken off for us. So like if we have like a roofing company like I was telling you before and they're looking for a certain type of spec in a certain type of location and it's in person or it's door to door that's all full cycle. The other thing that I've just been really lucky is that since I've been doing it for so long, I've like compounded a big database. So, I think like my list of sales reps is like 300K. I mean, it's not like all active, but I mean, in our CRM situation, which we got to move to an at a formal ATS, we use HubSpot, but it's like the amount of just like farming we can do out of our CRM just in general on good reps is a lot. Then we also just get it because of the reputation. We now just get so many referrals. So like a saying I always have with my team is like good sales people know other good sales people. So a good example is like there was a guy who I knew he came from selling books door to door and then he found this high you know he found a remote high ticket company. He can like sell out of his underwear. He doesn't have to go knock doors and he's like and for him the sales were easier. So like that guy told all of his friends at Southwestern like literally like 15 of his reps like guys I found like the holy [ __ ] grail you know and so like we always try to work like if you place a thousand reps a year and you can get a good referral rate from those reps that also compounds the database and you keep farming the database and then we we run like a bunch of job site traffic across like you know because we have to constantly fulfill our pipeline with like Australia and this and Europe and because like sometimes we have to place people specific specifically in these time zones or countries or even in person. So, we always kind of run like an existing like base level of traffic, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. Traffic sucks generally for recruiting, but like with my team like we'll funnel all the traffic into big big group interviews and then like you know if we have to get you know to to be able to place somebody from cold like that type of traffic, you have to sift through hundreds of candidates to find like a couple good. That's why it's not really realistic for like a small business owner. So there's that, there's the outbound, there's the pipeline, and there's referrals. But all of that is 90% of what we've done for recruiting pretty much since like 2021 or so. So that's we played with trying to place more of the people from the program, but the problem is again is like going direct in the closing roles. They're just not as experienced. Occasionally you do get somebody who's like been in sales for 15 years and they're like, I've just never heard of high ticket sales. Yeah, I mean that person you can give a shot sometimes after they go through the training, but it really like these things are much more independent than you would think. That's why I was able to shut it down and our recruiting never even missed a beat. Yeah, it's amazing. So the B2B is the nice thing is sorry I keep cutting up. The nice thing is is everybody thought that. So like when people would try to compete that's what they think they would need to do. So like they would compete and like start two companies and I'm like I'm like yeah it's like not how it works. And you know, they just don't realize like you can't just pick somebody off the street and then have somebody pay you 10 or 20 grand or however much it is to place a sale. Like they're not going to be good. Like you actually got to find good people which is why like you know it's a done for you business and it's tough. Yeah. I have so many questions for you. So so the B2B portion of the business that stayed running and still is the recruiting piece and then it's what like do you still do B2B management style or no? No. I mean so we don't do any like Okay. So, generally the core business is people who are probably on rep one through six, I would say. So, well, sometimes they're not even they don't even have a rep. So, all of my marketing is to basically bring on people who like want to get a sales rep. Now, a couple things can happen and also not a lot of people know this and this is also why it's really really hard to compete is that like when I started the market was in a place in 2020 where we were having growth like nobody like this the supply demand and just how everything worked out like companies were popping like million-dollar months like freaking crazy. And so at that stage the scale and like the space was just new like the internet marketing DR crowd had kind of moved into everybody was doing high ticket um to where like I could exclusively back when we started only work with people who were like 50k a month plus and who like legitimately needed a sales rep. So my marketing still now is all like hey get a sales rep whatever. But like a huge portion of our applications are somebody who's like they they reach out for a sales rep and it's like dude like you don't got anything in place. And so we have to kind of like downell that into a program that can kind of get them ready to go. You you can't make the funnel work without that. And that and that program has to be good. So like a lot of our sales are that and then at the and then you know we can kind of help them with like a funnel and ads and whatever and then give them a setter once that's all ready. But then like after that it's people who are reps one through four, one through six. It's usually that type of range is the bulk of people. And so that's like the core kind of offer. And then there's like an upsell depending on it really depends. Like we do our mastermind and that's part of it, but that's just one of the many deliverables. Some people never some people in our backend for four years. They never even attended a single mastermind. And so that can be anywhere from like 26K to like we have like 150k contracts. And so like that's its own thing. And then we get a lot of recurring a good backend through that. And then we have like an enterprise division which is really my going to be my main focus probably in Q3 and Q4 which is companies doing 70 to $100 million plus. So in sales recruiting the reason I can get away with what I do now is because I know the space so well that if you're hiring your first rep, I can teach you like, okay, to get this all to work, you need to change your offer to this. You need to change your pricing to this. You need to change your funnel to this. Your sales ops needs to look like this. and then okay we're going to give you a sales rep here's exactly what to do tell them you know say this and then also like we can give the sales rep a lot of training put them into our training etc so like I but I can't do that for like a roofing company at 3 million a year cuz they're going to have those same problems they're going to have essentially the same problems in that like their ops isn't good and their process isn't good and the founders never removed themsel from sales he still has texts like you know not even showing up the jobs and stuff I can't like teach a roofer how to do his business. I don't know. But once you get past this kind of like 50 to 70 million a year mark almost in any business, sales recruiting is just sales recruiting. It's just recruiting. So those are then we can work with 100 plus industries. And so like our enterprise division, I don't know if it's six clients or 10 clients, but it's generally people who need more than three reps per month because like if you have a 100 person sales team, 5% churn is five reps a month just a replacement. So like those are good um those are really good contracts and Q3 Q4 that's what I'm really trying to build is like 10 to 50,000 a month recurring contracts which has way more enterprise value etc and uh a bunch of other benefits like you know you're talking about a company whose funnel didn't work out and then like you know it was over I mean if you have a hundred corporate contracts you know your funnel could not work for two years you're probably going to be fine right so it's just a different business and it's a different it's a whole different thing. But we we work with moving companies for that, health companies, you know, companies who are the really big ones in the info space, uh, roofing companies, solar companies. There's one out of Mexico that's really big that we worked with, and probably some others that I'm not thinking about. Yeah, it's funny. It's like, you know, all these guys, you, me, all, you know, trying to hit info coaching, exit velocity, and then go into this other world of something that's kind of no longer info coaching recruiting. Well, you want to but also you don't want to be one of those guys who you got to be smart about it because most people who go down that path they kind of do it and then they come back and they're like, well, you know, like I'm I'm starting this all over again, you know? And so I don't want to be one of those guys. I'm like, I got a pretty good like I'm kind of set, right? So like I don't want to throw the you know the baby out with a bath water all in pursuit of you know I don't know you know it's like trying to be like oh I can do something outside of this industry or whatever right so you kind of have to strike a balance but genuinely like if I'm you know Hormosi talks about you have to look at your company and look at what's the natural extreme or whatever like what is the biggest company in the world that does what you do right and so like I looked up you know I'm like okay I'm watch the YouTube video I'm like following the advice so I look up recruiting companies And I'm like, okay, what does like a nine figure recruiting company look like? Okay, what does a billion dollar recruiting company look like? And the big commonality I had with every literally I got a list. I looked at all of them, did a bunch of research. The commonality with all of them is I had more clients like than all of the multi-figure companies. Like I have probably 800 to a,000 active clients. Um, the average 9 figure recruiting company had like two to 400. So I'm already double their client load and double their operational complexity. They're just up market, you know, and so that happens with a lot of companies even in the SAS space is like I don't know if you've read if what's the book uh not predictable revenue but the the sequel um impossible to inevitable and it's like he talks about how like inbound marketing usually like SAS companies will top out at like 20 30 million a year. It's like a reverse uh hyperbolic curve. It's like like this. And then like to really be able to go up market, you have to build like a formal like outbound function and like increase the contract size. Yeah. No, I love it. Well, so what's the B2B? I've heard of it. It's 8 figure boardroom, right? Is your Yeah, that's like our mastermind, right? That's kind of like our anything that's like uh our backend above a certain level is called that, but we have people in there who do it for like they want more sales consulting, one-on-one help, more coaching, consulting, more recruiting, uh sales training, etc. And they don't even attend the events, you know. So, but the events are fun. Yeah. And then Yeah, because what I mean I'm trying to figure that out right now is like who has them? Like I've heard your you have yours. Um Iman now has his like there's a couple other ones. There's some free ones that I get kind of in. I'm like should I have one of these that's like you know free basically because I love this info coaching world. I'm like sitting in my land over here. It's like I want to run this and run this and I want to scale this but like I also kind of want this piece. I just don't want to like you said like exit industry or go into like these other things like oh I want to go learn about real estate or oh I want to go do lead genen and like all this other stuff because it's like no I need to keep the focus within info coaching and I learn so much when I have conversations like these or when I'm in the rooms with those guys. Um the other one uh Jeremy Haynes he was just on he has his inner circle that's kind of more marketing focused but like they have I think he said 18 people doing over a million a month than his. So yeah, I mean I feel like that's a cool model though to like make good obviously like large. Well, if you if what you're So for you personally, if what you're doing if what you want to optimize for is just learning and then meeting cool people. The the best events I've done are ones where I just get together a bunch of cool people and I text them. I say like, "Hey, if I got together like this list of people, would you like pay 5K to help me cover the cost?" Or like would you pay like seven grand to help me cover the cost? And so like we've done like here in Scottsdale like the waste management open like I had everybody pay a little bit of money. We got a box. We did like a quick like mastermind day. Everybody like shared what's working and then like we uh did a bunch of cool [ __ ] afterward. Went to a concert like hung out whatever. I did another one in Paris that was like that with like that one was with all of my top clients. So I tried to make it all people above a million a month or above even some people are above 100 million. And so that was I mean that that event I learned more at that event than I've learned at any event and it was my event and it was like I was just learning from I just told all my clients like just share your best [ __ ] you know and you dude you learn so much. So if if you're doing it to learn you don't want to like necessarily build like a big m cuz that's like a different thing if you want to make money it's a good model to make money but most masterminds don't make that much money because they grow on referrals and the free tickets and all the you kind of have to use it. It's a really great backend is is the way to make it work, you know. Yeah. No, I mean that sounds that sounds Eddie was like, "Yeah, you should like we should deal with this one that's, you know, 10K or 100K or whatever you're saying some crazy thing." And he was like, "Do something in Dubai or do some whatever like get everyone together." And I'm like, "Dude, like I don't want to make a business out of this. I don't want to have I don't want to deal with all that." And but it is even if you do a fun event, it's a lot to deal with, you know? It's like a lot of coordination and then you're like, "Fuck, I got to do this and like I'm not even making money and like but then you have fun." So, I don't know. do it one time and then see if you want to do it again. Yeah. No, I mean that's what these conversations were initially as, right? It's like cool people that I didn't I ran these for 60 days. I think that was just me and I did a day a video a day every day for 60 days. Then all of a sudden I had like reach or whatever on X mainly and then a little bit through just random DMs from people and then was like I'm just gonna start talking to cool people that I had never had access to. I've sat in the cage, worked for eight eight years, never met anyone, never got out of there, never did anything and I was like this is kind of cool. So that's what these were. And then all the comments in the beginning are like Ryan, all you do is like ask these questions or like selfish this or like you talk too much. I'm like, bro, I'm just recording my conversations. Like is all this is this isn't meant for I have no monetization model. I don't have some offer. People can stop watching. Like I don't care. That helps a lot when like I remember when I was making content before I had anything to sell. I swear you get way better engagement, you know? It's like once they know you're you're you're shilling, right? It's like it it doesn't it doesn't work as well. But um no, you're doing really well. Yeah. No, I did the like Rolodex thing like last week. People are blowing up my DMs like, "Oh, I need a sales agency or oh, I need a media buyer. Oh, I need this." And I kept like I kept screenshotting them and like tweeting them and it was just like, "Who has somebody for this person?" Cuz I don't know. And then I had like this couple people that I like do work with or have worked with that like I feel okay about sending to and they're like, "Oh, I'll give you kickbacks and all this stuff." Tweeted was like, "Guys, like warning, may get kickbacks. like financial compensation may be in tune if you work with these people, but like I have them and instant flow on that and I was like I don't even know how I feel about that. Like five grand from this and 30 grand from like all these things. I'm like I don't know. I don't know. I'm just kind of doing these for fun. So So what is next for So you close these down. You have this next layer now where it's going to be B2B B2B enterprise is going to grow. You said you got your guy already that you now have you're going to restart up RCA. Yeah. And you're just going to lean in. Well, yeah. I mean it's it's really for Okay. Okay. So, if I had to break out down our initiatives, it's like right now, same way as we were just talking earlier, I I think I've I think I'm like 90 I think I feel like I've been 90% there for a long time is I want to get a liquidating front end for our B2B, which is I've done liquidating frontends a bunch for B TOC when I had RCA and you know, I mean, even even just helping clients with it and stuff like I get it, you know, B2B is so much more difficult just if you look at the CPMs even if like you had an opt-in page like the optin is like 100 bucks. Like it's it's a little bit harder to make work. That's kind of like right in front of me. The initial thing I want to do, especially because I will tell you like my funnel's been running. I've had other funnels that work and we have other funnels that are going on, but like the main funnel that [ __ ] has been running for like 5 years and it just I keep thinking I'm like when's it going to stop working? But it keeps plugging. So I don't I don't know. Hopefully it keeps working for a long time. But liquidating front end is kind of the main thing for B2B right now. and then relaunching the B TOC. Uh I don't want to I you know I feel like I've learned enough about scaling these and what it looks like and risk and you know also like how to maximize for profit. My goal is honestly probably like 600 grand a month at 50% profit. You know I think for that I'm good. It'll help our pipeline a little bit. It does help with some setters and entry- level positions and um you know it'll be fun to have the right person for it. So that's kind of that goal. And then the Q3 Q4 big initiative is really building up the enterprise accounts. And I mean that's something to where like even if we close two to three a month, two a month, um they they tend to stick around much like they're not like clients where like you know some clients if they don't buy your back end like you don't you don't ever hear from them again. Like these are people where you have to have the relationship to get into business. It's a slow way to get into business but it's also slow to get out of business. and they might pause for a couple months, but then they come back, you know? So, as long as you do well with them, they're pretty good. So, we we've had a lot of success with them. They're really pretty easy to work with. It's just hard to There's not that many of them. You can't run an ad and be like, "Hey, if you're doing over 100 million a year, you know, opt into this funnel." Yeah. You guys done a bunch of outbound for that for the B2B side? So, um, we do we do a considerable amount of outbound now and out me and outbound has been a has been an up and down relationship. So, like I'm like, you know, especially because with what I do, like what you couldn't really do outbound with what you do. I mean, I guess you could like DM people on Instagram and stuff. It's just probably not Yeah. with us. No, no, it's probably not worth it. Like you could, you know, Yeah. the economics don't work. The economics like low levels you could maybe DM some people, but like it's not going to do like 50 million a year or something for you. it's just not worth it. But for us, you know, it's it's like sales recruiting, right? Like we can probably make outbound work. So when I first launched it, it was very cold email and cold calling focused. Within 60 days, which if you study outbound, this is unprecedented. Within 60 days, we were doing 300 grand a month. And I was like, [ __ ] yeah. 306 grand. Uh I remember the second month or the third month we did 306 grand collected from outbound which like people tell you to get to like a million a year or like 100 grand a month with outbound with some companies it could take 18 months. I was like dude we got there in 60 we're the best. The issue was is dude I had a really good way of procuring lists and I just ran out of list. So like I you know because with our industry I can't go to sales nav like if I'm targeting realtors I can go to salesen nav and be like okay I want a realtor this that this and you know I get a good list right I can go to any seamless list uh any of these list kit like any of this stuff and I can get like my list well like if I'm targeting like coaches or like okay I want to work with like the Amazon FBA coach and you know you and like you you guys don't I call it self-identifying it's like you guys don't self-identify um platforms like LinkedIn like it you you know your profile or whatever might be tons of different [ __ ] Yeah. Mine was like working digital for the last like seven years. Yeah. So it's like really really it's like really really difficult to like segment a list but I was able to I had some kind of ways I did it and I was able to but the issue is we ran out of contacts. So then we kind of like slowly went down to like 150 to 200 grand a month. And then when I scaled all those companies I was like yeah [ __ ] this 200 grand a month. Like I'm just let go of the whole team. I was like, we're just done. I was like, that's just another thing we're doing. I just wasn't even focused on it. I, you know, that that division, I called it the hot potato division because we would give we would give it to a new leader every 3 months and like it just was like this neglected initiative. So, I cut that. Then, back when I let go of all the companies last year, so about this time last year, I was like, one of these initiatives, I'm going back outbound. We're [ __ ] blowing this [ __ ] up. So then I hired basically uh two outbound sales directors and then restarted an initiative uh that was our cold email initiative. So I basically had three initiatives. I tested them all against each other and one guy who basically was like the sales director for like Twilio and all these like big SAS companies. He immediately started seeing really good lead genen results through the method that he used. And so I was like, "Okay, great. We're going to go with you." So all this other stuff is gone. We're going with you. And now, um, transparently, last month we did terrible. Um, we had a rep out, then one rep quit, and then we had like these setters ramping and it [ __ ] up our lead quality. But like generally we're we're doing I have to look at the numbers. Let's call it like 150 to 200 outbound appointments a month. 250. And um, like what was our revenue? 150 grand, 200 grand in revenue. Yeah, probably like maybe 250. I don't know. I should probably know this. 150 to 200 grand in revenue. 24 time What's 24 * 14? 24 * 14 336. Okay, there you go. That was that was May. And then last month we took a huge [ __ ] And so now we're like now we're like getting back up. June, I will tell you, I don't know how it is in your industry sucks. Like I look back, what's nice about having uh like five or six, however many years into this is like you can look it back, you know, seasonality is kind of a thing, kind of not, but I will say I've always had bad Junes. Yeah. Ours is like a 40 to 60 year old 40 to 60 40 to 60 year old uh female. And so when we have the Junes, the hot months, the coming into school being done, all of that, like our show rate last month was the worst it's been year to date. And it's like we are changing things in the marketing. It is not just seasonality, but like it hits like you can see it in the cancellation reports. You can see like oh conflict or oh family trip now or oh this like these things come up that you're like so yeah I feel that. So the reason I asked that um is I've heard some numbers and some stats but you know you've said Hormosi a lot of time uh you know the gym launch numbers I'm sure you've heard that what they do with outbound I've heard that's happening across other companies in that world too uh of his that they are hammering it still and have huge divisions that like half of the half of you know overall comes in through outbound and when you have economics like that an enterprisegrade like level I mean obviously you need your list and you need your like you know starting foundational point but I feel like you hit that and it's Yeah. Well, I mean, it's hard. I mean, even with him, I I I had dinner with him and I was like, we're really building our outbound function. Like, what's your advice? And I mean, this is before he was like obviously as big as he is now. And uh he tells this publicly as well. And so, I think like they went like months without even a single sale. Oh, yeah. Like months. And then it took like really a year for them to get it to where but I think where his I mean we we have a good backend as well. His was monstrous. I I don't know if Gym Launch is doing like like we do like 120 to 140 new clients a month. I I had it as high as 170 to 180, but our CAC was too high. So like I kind of scaled it back and now we're even more profitable at a at a little bit of a lower scale. And just it's also you know when you do services if you scale [ __ ] B TOC you can kind of get away with it. If you try to like I've done this so many times if you try to like nuke the growth of services dude you just get screwed because like you have to hire the right fulfillment team you have to hire the right like you have to make sure the recruiters are good and the recruiter if you have too many recruiters are ramping at one time then your sales quality in terms of your recruits drop. So it is a little bit of a balance there. But um where was I going with that in terms of scaling B2B meeting with him? 140. Yeah. So like I think gym lunch I could be wrong but I don't think they were at that number of new clients but they just had like a very specific segment that like they came in and it's like you do this playbook exactly and you implement this and because it was like independent locations like I can't tell every client to do the same. Imagine if I told you to do the same thing as like a Amazon FBA coach. Like you know, you guys can't run the same [ __ ] funnel. You have two different businesses, but like for them like they can implement the same exact thing in Austin, is in LA, is in this, is in that. So it's like a very predictable way to get a quick cash influx and then boom, long-term contract. So I think like they might have only been doing 40 to 60 units is my guess a month at 20K. So replacing that with outbound 50% volume is super reasonable. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. So what is your like and this is like the Ryan question show. So sorry about this. But like I'm so curious like what is your structure of like how you run things? Like how is your seuite like what is your day-to-day in this? Like it sounds like you understand everything that's happening in all the buckets which I definitely resonate with. Um but like almost too much like I feel like sometimes I'm too in the weeds. I talked to you before. It's like right like project management like I'm getting out of these things. So it can be more owner decision- making sit basically have the seauite report to each other and like this and facilitate the seauite is like where I'm trying to go with it. So it's truly like owner not like owner operate and this and this and this. How does yours look cuz you guys were doing big numbers which in my you know peon brain over here is like okay so pretty lean team in relation to us at least right on like the count but how did that look like what's your dayto-day? Yeah. So, I mean, well, there's a lot to unpack there, right? So, um, the first thing I'll say is, you know, I have a CMO who is a beast. Okay. So, I mean, I have a CMO, CFO. I have, you know, in our industry, you don't really need like a COO. Like, a COO is like a weird term. um like you know really a true COO in our industry would be somebody who would run like fulfillment I guess and sales in my opinion like it's it's kind of like you know if you run like a manufacturing facility or a warehouse like okay you need a COO like but in this company it's people want one but what they really need is like a good like ops manager who kind of manages all the VAS and like a couple of the more higher level ops people right so CFO CMO So that person ops manager then I have a recruiting director who manages the team. The recruiting team is maybe 20 people I think. I I know it's like 16 recruiters or 18 recruiters now. It's something along those lines. It goes up and down. But we have that person and then and then there's like different pods and sub managers and team leads within that. But uh then we have a sales director. I have two sales directors because I kind of I still have two separate sort of divisions. So I have two sales directors. They both report to me. I mean, I could make it to where there's like a CRO and, you know, whatever, but I I like sales team stuff and working with sales managers, so it's not a drain on me. It's fine. So, I have two sales directors and then where am I and then I have a fulfillment director and then a fulfillment like assistant coach. So, like a lot of times as the as the teams grow, you kind of have the director who's more of like the strategic systems brain and coaching, but then you have to add like an assistant coach. Like so for instance some of my clients um you I have a health client for instance who they basically were at 400 grand a month. They cracked a liquidating front end. Boom 4 million a month like just within six months. And so they because they were they were making money on the front end with their thing. And so because of that they were like we need to we called it dirty scaling or uh dirty bulking. We were like we need to dirty bulk. So like people started like hiring like all of these like rep I shouldn't say we it's like they did it but you know they were calling me. uh they started like hiring all of these reps and one of the things like I tell people in those situations is like they they have the director who's like the strategy like if we're going to change the script, if we're going to change the sales ops, if we're going to change whatever, like that's that guy, right? But then after that, you really just need like glorified like sales coaches. You can call them managers if you want, but like all they should be [ __ ] doing is like QC, call reviews, feedback, one-on- ons, career coaching, like recruiting. That is it, right? So, um I don't know what got Oh, yeah. So, fulfillment team, director, coach, and then there's me, right? Before I had all of that, and then I had a guy who was kind of like the CEO of that. And then I had and then I had that same structure, not a uh I didn't have a recruiting director obviously for RCA, the B TOC side, but we had basically, you know, fulfillment, uh sales, and then ops and ops, marketing, and finance are shared services between the two companies. And so those three directors were kind of on both. And then there was a guy over here. So then there was me and I just had two direct reports. That was pretty cool. And then I was over marketing as well. And I was over the the shared services. I was over each of those. And then I was over like revenue uh profit center operator CEO CRO guy number one and number two. So that was the structure that really kind of got me to where I was at. Then when I let everything go, I came back as like CEO of the B2B. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I mean this is the exact conversation we had earlier but it's like for us I'm basically the COO because I came in so I was like minority% I came in I'm co-owner not co-founder right so like CEO and you know chief product brand face whatever you want to call it like they were this the whole time and I was kind of just like facilitating things and then now as it's grown and like where we're going to take it it's like okay cool Ryan just like runs these and you know Luke sits as like visionary and all these things of different initiatives but direct operationally I'm in that so but I completely agree with you it's like as that kind of shifts more and more up. It's like you don't really need an operator. Like I mean you need like a you do you need an operator but you don't need like a COO full caliber person that comes from XYZ place. It's like it's just it's really kind of like efficiencies and project management. Making sure things get over the finish line. We're all you know initiatives tied together is a big one that we have. So like that this fuels this in the right way or the strategies in alignment from this to this from marketing to sale to sale to fulfillment fulfillment to backend like sales. So that's kind of like where our dance is for you to um I mean I guess with as a sales function it's probably a little more dialed in for you but like one of the big things for us is the retention sales. It's like this awkward play of sale to CS for onboarding to fulfillment which is a full-on coach that doesn't want to sell anyone joins the team. So they don't have to do the sales, they don't have to do recruiting, you know, they don't have to run any of their own stuff. All they get to do is coach. All they want to do is coach. So it's like comes up on end of term which for us is a year and it's like who does this? So we have these client journey advisers that are OG uh like player coaches that then moved over here and it's kind of like this weird pass off and it's going pretty good now but like it's been bumpy bumpy bumpy and like as we just said that's like where all the money is or a lot of the money come from. So like we've navigated that and what where do they sit in the hierarchy of things? Like do they sit over with sales? Do they sit in filming? Do they sit in CS? like kind of this like awkward division. The way I do it is I have a really unique model in the sense where my fulfillment team has to be like really good salespeople. Yeah. Quite convenient, you know. So like for both offers by the way and it's like I've actually never seen I mean unless you do the same thing I do basically I've really never seen a situation where somebody could do that where it's like cuz like my fulfillment team act like so the ascension career ascension to my company is usually not always but like reps will start off as a you know uh inbound closer whatever or outbound closer and then eventually like as they get experience and like they're they become really good then we'll move them to the fulfillment which I know is bizarre. What's cool about that is that with that like they earn commissions based on the amount of accounts they get and the receivables of those accounts and then they have an increased commission on upsells and cross sales etc. So like cuz if you've been a So I built this knowing you know I used to be a sales rep full-time obviously and the worst thing about a sales rep is you have a great month and then you know yesterday was the first right and our sales are always [ __ ] on the first because everybody's depressed and they're like [ __ ] you know like starting over from [ __ ] zero and so you got to start over from zero whereas like a sales rep's dream is to be an insurance where they make annuities where you don't have to do [ __ ] right and so like I kind of created that for my fulfillment team to where it's like they're they're they know they're going to get the money every month. Does that make sense? And so it's like a nice place to like do and you still get to do sales and you work with bigger contracts and higher level people and it's more like stimulating. So that's kind of the ascension. So I'm really lucky in that, you know, our fulfillment team does their own sales. Right now, for clients, what I recommend full stop is like you you you think of your CSMs as basically setters and then you have a dedicated back-end closer and then you need to somehow position the dedicated back-end closer at your scale especially. You need to somehow position that person as like kind of an authority in the group or in like the coaching so that that way people are excited to speak with them and there's like a little bit more weight to the conversation. So, like for a lot of founders, I'm like, even if you're doing 60 new clients a month, you might only have out of that 30 upsell opportunities, that's one a day. You can batch that out in four days of your month, you know, or six days of your month. And dude, those six days could net you like they could double your business. So, like don't try to pass it on to somebody else. Just do it. But obviously, you're guys a scale. You have a [ __ ] ton of people, right? So like so you would have to have like a dedicated backend closer who's kind of like also somehow you know the head coach or something in the group or like two of them who you know when they talk with them like oh yeah you know like I liked your call about this or whatever and then those people are the ones that do the the upsells if that makes sense. Yeah. We almost had an issue with the fulfillment side of it. So that like cuz right you're think about it like a funnel right it's like the framing that they were getting on that call like you're saying. So edification, authority, whatever. Even before that, the service was all around getting them results. Like our client wins channel is just like firing, but it was framed as like we're going to get you through this year and we're going to get you all this result in this year. Never really like, oh, this is like your lifelong thing. And like up until four to 6 months ago, we finally like really looked into fulfillment as like, okay, how do we make these just layup calls that just happen? Because we didn't even have six months ago, we didn't even have advisors on the back end. It was literally just like if they renewed, they renewed. It's crazy. Like we ran math like dude it's 30 40 million we left on the table. Like we have over 10,000 high ticket clients that have gone through this and we have you know 4,000 active. It's like what happened to those 6,000 and we didn't have another offering to have some continuity like downell that didn't include one to one but still had personalization. Now we have that and now we have these you know CJ CJAS that do these like different splits and then they get commission like this whole stack. But it's like it's just crazy. So, I've taken up too much of this, but I have asked people questions and I feel as if we should answer those and then we can pop, I'm sure, cuz we kind of going over on time here, so I apologize. I have I have 15, so Okay, perfect. All right. What's your go-to playbook for turning customers into super fans? Oh, I don't know. Getting results, I guess. You know, that's a pretty good one. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that really works in B2B is if you can teach them. Okay. So, like, you know, you can tell like I'm like a massive like I've like legitimately watched every Hormosi video that exists, you know, and so like one of the things that I've also gotten from him, this was early on. I learned this even before acquisition.com is like what they did really well was, you know, you would come in as a gym and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to like use this company for leads or whatever." But really what you end up doing is like you get taught a new way of running your company. And when you enter into that new paradigm, what happens is is like if you shift your business model around this new way of doing it, then as you go through the levels of scale, any problem that arises, you look to the company to help you with that problem. Does that make sense? And so, and you know, when I sold for traffic and funnels too, like that was kind of their they were good at that as well. And so like we we can't do I mean look like some clients are going to come in and like they're like they they just want the sales reps. We give them the sales reps and then they come back later for more sales reps. Great. But like if I could have my way with every client, you know, it would be like can we like really get them on our operating systems of like running and building a sales team or even like their overall company and then stuff like that because then when cuz the issue is this is this is the is this is why I like the enterprise accounts is if I take you from two sales reps to four sales reps, I doubled your company, right? I mean it's just two hires, right? I mean, sure, you got to scale the ads, but that's that's the thing is like it's not that easy to, you know, double your company, just add two sales reps. Then the bottlenecks are all for the next 6 months or 9 months. Scaling the ads, fulfillment, okay, I got to add a backend now cuz my CAC went up, you know, how do I lead a team cuz now I have more people. And so, if I don't have like that extra level of support there, they're not gonna use my services again for like a year, you know, or like six months, right? because like it's going to now there's all these other problems. So like if I can get them to kind of start running my playbooks of marketing, sales, operations, fulfillment, finance, then as they are in that intermediary period, there's like other stuff they look to us for help. So I know that I don't know if that's that you know. Yeah. No, I mean that makes sense, right? Yeah. I mean they they come to you for one thing and they get a one-stop shop over time and I mean yeah that's what I like about info coaching too though is like when everyone's kind of running the same at some level everyone's running the same playbook. So yeah, they're doing this different or a little bit different here, but like if they're kind of subscribing, there's the couple core funnels, there's a couple core acquisition methods, there's the couple core, you know, high ticket direct to card, there's this, there's then there's fulfillment. Like even when you and I were texting, you're saying numbers and stats, like we're speaking the same language in two seconds. And like that's that's a super strength. So uh what are the I don't even know if you have uh but what are the two levers you would pull to scale a B2B SMB SAS business from 1 million to 10 million ARR? What are the two levers you would pull to scale a SAS business from 1 million to 10 million error? Well, well, yeah. What's interesting about that is that like so we work with SAS clients and generally I mean, you know, again, you probably heard this, I'm not going to say anything new, is like you kind of have to know what business you're in. So, like when we were in the medical business, it was like I was like, dude, this is the [ __ ] compliance business. Like when we were doing, you know, stem cells and this and that and it's like everything it's like attorneys, attorneys, attorneys. Can we say you think the trying to be FTC compliant is bad. You haven't even seen anything. It's like it's like you got to be FTC compliant and you got to be FDA compliant. It's just it's a it's a mess. When you're in the cleaning business, it's a you know, how do you hire lowkilled bilingual, you know, people and have good bilingual managers who can keep these like cleaners or whatever on track, right? The same thing with like the home services business. If you if you watch like you would like this guy, uh you might know who he is. He built a $600 million a year garage door company. Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah, but like dude, he's act if you listen to his Ryan Panea is a good friend of mine and like if you listen to um you know Ryan's podcast with him, you can tell like one of the things he unlocked that uh a lot of those guys struggle with is it seems I mean I don't know I'm not a home services guy but it seems like is like really building a great recruiting pipeline and system of managing the techs you know and so because like these guy you know making sure they're not smoking in the freaking truck and like they're showing up to jobs in the right time and they're like they actually like have good customer service when like you know stuff that like we would think is basic but in that industry maybe is not I don't know. So like that's kind of that's but in our business it's really the marketing and sales uh business right now for for SAS it's product and so what I see is like dude if you can get your SAS to like a million 2 million a year usually like you have good product market fit and dude running ads for SAS is like the easiest thing I've ever seen in the world like it is crazy and even the sales calls super like you ever gotten on a call with HubSpot terrible you you know, like like a lot of these reps are horrible, dude. Like they could get replaced with AI, frankly. Like they're so bad and it's like a bad it's like a negative. It's not even a neutral exp. It's like negative experience. So, um I think like it's quite easy to, you know, scale that up with ads and stuff. And usually what happens is again what we were mentioning earlier is people get to like you know 10 or 20 million a year and then like eventually uh they bring in an outbound function to go up market and be able to scale further you know but the biggest thing is the product market fit you know because like a lot of companies who worked with us who were like trying to figure out their ads for SAS dude like the the the problem is is like if if you're a coach and your ads don't work we can pivot your offer overnight you know you could you could go from weight loss to maybe you niche down a little bit more and like what really worked is this emphasis on hormones or whatever like who knows you you can't like change your product overnight like your product just might suck so that's kind of the main thing to focus on there yeah makes sense yeah right is like they he just came out with that video Becker with that like long form video how they did it and leaning so heavily in on that piece of it and yeah yeah I mean he's a great example of just like I mean just nucillar levels of success but I mean they don't didn't spend that much on ads because that's what he's saying. He's like, it's so little. Like, you know, like when I'm telling people to run ads, I'm like, yeah, well, do you use higher? Okay. Yeah, you you got to use it. You know, it's like one of those things where I'm like, you got to use it. You know, here you go. And so people just like their their reps are definitely just taking orders. Yeah. Yeah. It's literally cashiers. Um, and this one for sure, creative incentives for setters where there's heavy inbound offers. creative incent so incentives for setters where there's uh heavy inbound offers. The heavy inbound offers is what I don't understand. Yeah. I think just like what are creative incentives for setters? I think what he's meaning is like so like us for example we are we didn't have setters until 71 million. Fun fact. Um and just all it was 30 minute closer calls. That's it. Just back to back to back to back insane volume. And 1.5% of the leads that came through the SL optin we closed and that was it. And call it a day and call it a day. And you know when I ran the VS when I ran the call funnel for B TOC we would do like and these are real numbers but I'm going to use 300 as like a even number but it it might have been 330 or 360 I don't know but I know like we were in the 300s in terms of uh units closed but if we did 300 240 of those closes would come from the setters. Isn't that insane? That's insane. Like that's why I pivoted it to a low ticket liquidating thing cuz I was like I pivoted it to a webinar that liquidated 60% of the budget because I was like well like I might as well I mean our setters are getting all the leads anyways. And and granted like the reason the inbound numbers were so low wasn't because like our cost per book call sucked. It just because the setters just destroyed the leads so hard that like there's probably people who would have booked and bought but we the setters just got them like immediately. But, you know, we were literally just like calling opt-ins, name, email, phone number, nothing else. Just like 240 or whatever closes per month. So, um, we only had 100 units from or Okay. Last, but we did, yeah, we had basically a 100 units last month that came and those we have three different buckets of setters. We have auto set, self set, and confirm set. I don't even count confirm set. It's calling a marketing booking. Um, but self-s set is like dialing the CRM. An auto set is low ticket ascension call or just like boarding, quick start, whatever. They take those as a 50-minute Zoom call and like triage, whatever you call it over to a closer. And those have the highest close rate, highest show rate, highest everything. It's just the economics like I was talking about earlier. But like we don't even touch it still. So I think what this guy meant though was like incentives around like how you comp them. I don't I'll be honest, man. Like there's a lot of people who want to know like incentives and this and that, dude. Like honestly, man, you just got to like manage people properly and just really stretch them to get the high to get the highest level of performance out of them, you know? Like I I've I've done crazy comp things and to be to be frank, I don't every single time I do it, I don't think it matters to be honest. I mean, they're going to want it. They're going to be like, "Yeah, give me the give me the comp structure." But like it I've never seen like even like piff bonuses, you know? Like that's the only one I kind of like, not for setters, but just in general for closers. Even that I don't even know if it correlates with more pips. Like if they're trained properly, they should maximize close rate and maximize cash collection. For setters, I mean, if they're trained properly, they should maximize sets and maximize show rate, maximize close. Like, but that's just about like you got to manage them in a way where like you're really challenging to bring out their best performance. And so like there's not a lot of crazy incentives. I do have a friend uh and client who he mentioned some stuff that I thought was interesting. Um he does a thing where there's a point system and I'm going to I'm going to butcher this but basically if you're like if you work the most hours or it's either hours or dials you get uh or if like you're the last per they have a physical office. If you're the last person in an office you get like a point. If you get the most closes in a day, you get like two points. If you get the most shows in a day, you get three another point. And like whoever has the most points gets like an extra 200 bucks that day. And so people will like stay in the office to like like because you got to think like to get that point, you got to be the last one out of the office. So people will be like dialing legitimately till like 10:00. I think I thought that was pretty uh he had a few other things that were interesting like that. They're like daily type of things. I actually liked that, especially with the in office thing. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I can't I wish I could remember more of what he was saying because that was the best one I heard. I was like, "Oh, that's actually pretty smart. I could see how that works." Yeah. All right. You got a hard stop in two minutes. One of these is a compliment. His 30-day closer program changed my life and opened my eyes to online world. I paid 500 bucks and I made 40K over the next six months. Nutty ROI. Webinars are printing back in 22 and this is this was great. So, that's a fun one. Um, and last one and then you can go obviously. Uh, what would be valuable skills to learn on top of sales base to grow and increase your worth? Basically, career development from setting to closing and beyond. I feel like you kind of talked about that within your company, but like other companies when someone goes from a setter to a closer to kind of sales management. I mean, like what is beyond that? Well, I mean, so what's beyond sales management? I know, right? I mean, is that kind of the natural Well, yeah. I mean, look, like what a lot Come work for me, you know? Um, what a lot of people do is, yeah, you you learn setting, you get into closing, you get into closing, okay, you're a manager, you ramp your first sales team, and then I I think the next stage, like if it was me, is I would try to be somebody like you just hired who's like got the pedigree of being a baller ass sales manager and just like work your way up to, you know, a company like yours or mine or like a company like um, you know, one of Hormos's portfolio companies or something where you can continue to get a lot of experience and and I would really try to find somewhere where like the best thing is if you can find somewhere like this is what I did is I got in a TF around 300 to 400 grand a month and then within like a year not because of me or something I mean I certainly contributed but like we were doing like 1.5 million a month and at that time 1.5 million a month I mean it sounds crazy to say it's like that's great you know I don't see that as like oh you're the king of the but at that time not really like there was nobody else doing that type of number in the space I mean this is like 2018 Right. So, I learned so much by Osmosis just by like being able to work with Taylor like personally every single day. Uh being in in their office. Uh just seeing how like I had no idea like how a company was even run. You know, being like, "Oh, that's what ops does. This is what finance does. Finance is this. This is the CFO. Okay. Hey, CFO, you know, what do you do?" Like you go out to dinner, you know, I learned. So, so when I went to start my own company, I knew so much about like the basics of like running a company which really accelerated it. So, I think that's a good focus. Uh once you know a lot of people get into the fractional thing that's tough. I think like what would be interesting for somebody to do is the Jeremy Jeremy Haynes model. I I think the top level if you just want to be like a [ __ ] sales manager is to do what Jeremy Haynes does but for sales management to where like you only want to work with like five clients and you just get banger clients and you just scale them up to like a million to 2 million a month and then you make a percentage, you know, like that's probably if you want to keep it lean and mean and like very focused on that skill and then you just focus on done for you. And the thing is is you got to just select the right clients. It's like if you get the right clients, dude, you can rip with that. Yeah. Yeah. And start your mastermind on the side. Make another couple million bucks a year just with the top sales guys. I love it. All right. Ended it with a banger. I appreciate you. Uh I will move out there and then we will do something when I'm actually out there and that'll be amazing, too. So, I appreciate Yeah. Oh, nice. Well, come visit and uh we'll show you around. Yeah. Half my family lives out there and half's here. So, I went to ASU for a semester. Lived in my dorm for a year, though. But uh yeah, well, you'll like it here for sure. Yeah, I was in Optima or I got approved at Optima, then I pulled out because I was like, I'm not going to do this till fall. So, TBD on timeline. But yeah, let me know when you're here. Cool. All right. Well, I appreciate you. We will definitely do some fun part two that's more in-depth once we're six months into this and see your growth and see maybe where we're at and it'll be good. Sick. Thanks, man. All right. Talk to you soon. Hey. Hey.
