in today's video I'm going to go through a March 2025 in review for our main info and coaching business I'm going to go through our year-over-year cash collected numbers for the month of March what went right this month what did not go right um some funnel metrics and math and then into our April 2025 plan for the company as well as some personal all right so last year we did 30 million in cash collected I make everything on this channel just to share what did work what did not work as you're about to see what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all right I do all to find top talent opportunities and build a solid network of people doing the same so let's get into it all right so this is all just no fluff actual numbers so for March of oops for March of 2022 we did about 600k in 2023 we did about 750 last year we did 2.7 and this year just last month it's 7: a.m. on the 1 so this is literally as of yesterday uh about 1.6 so not good right that's like trending about half of what we trended last year so let's get into what went right what went wrong and then I'll explain kind of our thinking behind this so what went right uh we had a new CMO come in on the tail end of the month same with an outbound director so we've never had a CMO in the company we've always done it ourselves so the other co-founder um is has been leading marketing and sales this entire time um or marketing mainly sales we've had a sales director come in about a year ago but um chief of marketing absolute sicko in the marketing space or in the info space um so this is extremely exciting so none of this is really reflective of any of these new people um and more or less it's like us running it off cliff uh waiting until we had somebody to run it properly because our acquisition has gone crazy and I'll show you that uh outbound director we've had we tested Setters like a year and a half ago had somebody on the team that was never quit their other job and was running ours and their so ours wasn't effective and then found out that they were still working their other jobs so we just got rid of it and then just never Revisited which is silly of us to do um but now we officially have an outbound director that came on and joined the team also ton of experience in the space like our CMO has sold over 100,000 low tickets on a single low ticket and the outbound director has done up to like 3 million or so in a month in cash collected through setting team so two very experienced individuals everyone else in the company has more or less grown into their role at least on not on the coaching side the coaching side they come in certified and all and like have all of that um but a lot of the time the people we're hiring that are in management or kind of like in office if you want to call it um are learning and getting the experience on the job and like me as a great example it's like these are my highest months it's not like I've done that some else come in with the Playbook and put it in place um so it's pretty cool to finally have experienced hires who have done the role can or and can bring the playbook in so Load Ticket we officially launched Load Ticket on the tail end of this month I'll show some stats and math around that um a firm for the longest time we running with different pay plans and different breakdowns of this we locked in our firm to perfectly match the term of uh the actual product um so this is actually going to be a huge lift because it's going to feed Facebook back with the right people because we have people doing like way lower monthly options but like misaligning with terms and it was just kind of messy so we clean this up uh reviews with coaches I just sent out a message about this in our team chat but we just passed over 300 on trust pilot like 200 and something I believe it's 200 something on uh Better Business Bureau which is big for our market Facebook Google all the things um so we went from like 110 or 15 to having over 300 just from doing a coaching push so basically doing like an incentivized program for the coaches uh I have another video on the channel where I talk about getting review and growth there but this is huge for us big flywheel a lot of people look up reviews before they get on a sales call or before they purchase and it's best to just have as many as possible um sales team onboarding I'll go into that and kind of like what went wrong and breakdown but we've been having issues with sales team uh performance and that's also a marketing issue right those are always kind of like in tandem um but we just have some issues there right like no direct income goals uh incentivizing or kind of like conversations around like I said income goals metrics they need to hit so if you're goal is 10K a month how many calls do you need to do how many do you need to close what's your average close what's your followup like just that wasn't clean for a lot of the team and that's just a longterm thing that's happened um management is you know getting more onetoone with them we've had pods and having to take away the pods so they could have better on toone connection but all of that I'll get more into that later Q2 planning I did a video on this on what our plan was and how we went through it and the actual structure of it and it went fantastic so again these two guys the first time that they were on this because we've we've done this in the past we do annual planning we do things and they're kind of loftier or I don't know if lofty is the right word but they're kind of more vague and lofty I guess and uh this was a real actionable like proper quarter League goals per person that align with departments that break out to the company overall goals um and this went really really well and again these two this is the first time they were in this meeting because they just joined the company um and then also the uh retention team is another piece in here so we never had a dedicated team we've always just aligned it with the coaches and basically just given them commission percentages on the people that they retain good and bad because they just kind of want to coach they don't want to also sell so we rolled out a retention team that was the Pod leaders that we took from sales that wanted to do retention so though how they can keep them um so there's more to come with this but just the initial launch of this is a win um we're going to do things with like continuity down cells almost that to keep people after their first year stuff like that sblo another video on here but we doubled our response rates on our app notebook sequence all by just sending blue bubbles instead of green um so is a pretty cool thing we got to figure out how to roll this out in other places SEO another just kind of like thing that got done uh we finally hired an SEO company because we got the site redone in January um and yeah so they have boosted a ton of things and grow in that way fixing a ton of technical errors that came in because we built for design not for SEO and we're going back to that and then triage we changed out some stuff this for us is our call confirmation team so that basically is just like dialing people as soon as they book and making sure you're confirming the call they have the highest percentages they've ever had on terms of claimed calls and now into what went wrong in the real of this so like I said here that's not good right so all these things are good all these things are good into the future and but in terms of like cash collected not good at all on the month and mainly what went wrong or just kind of overall show rates drop to sub 50% for the first time in like a long time so a lot of things changed a lot we changed the entire sequence around it we changed a bunch of stuff in marketing which is likely a big cause of it um we changed how the confirmation team was reaching out we like we basically threw a ton of stuff at it which is not the answer necessarily but we did and they have dipped they have kind of come back a bit and we're still trying to solve for this but show rates dipped so if we di 10% on a th calls then a 100 of those didn't show and if you have a 20% close like you just missed out on 20 units right quick math and that was across the entire month which is like not cool um so we broke automations we changed things we like it was just a mess um sales per booking this is going to be a market this is going to be marketing this going to be show rates there going to be close rates right um it was terrible it the lowest month we've had in like a year and a half so calendars were 75% booked I have some data over here so don't mind me but yeah calendars were like 75% book and we had the lowest rate since December of 23 I want to say yeah December of 23 on the lowest sales for booking which is like crazy so we use this metric a lot and it's just overall bookings to overall sales and there's a lot of other ones like show rate live rate um live of qualified like all these different ones and the sales team is doing like okay so it's it's really like a mix between marketing and sales that happen an issue and then due to that CPA went wild so we have new CMO coming in changing things on that we're testing low ticket we're doing Setters we're doing all these different things to affect CPA but this last month like just if you look at the month as is not on what we're going to do just on what happened it was bad like bad bad so we broke even lost money within that month due to that okay so going into the actual funnel metrics of math I have uh I have different videos where I go through the actual funnel but quick gist of it you have paid traffic we do have organic the organic is mainly going to come in through the application because that's what the CTA is on site and on a lot of the organic um but for paid we're going to run traffic to an opt-in page that's first name email to a vssl funnel and then we're also now running paid direct to a low ticket okay so for this I'm going to go through the metrics and the math around here but for optins we had 30,000 leads come in so first name email and then they watch the vssl tons of email followup tons of uh things in there then they land on an application page once they land on the application page um technically this router's over here but what I mean by this is from the application we have a routing setup that's really actually just two-ways so it's basically they say that they have less than 1K they've ever invested in their health and fitness it will send them down to this router if they have anything above that it'll send them up to the main booking page with the main closers so we had three uh 3,500 qualified apps meaning above the 1K and we had 3,345 that were DED so I'll get into where they route on here but of the ones that booked or of the ones I'm sorry that applied that were uh higher quality 1,800 of them booked a call that were qu that were uh designated as qualified bookings and these are going to go to the top closers and these are people who have spent 20K in their health and fitness 5K like these bigger numbers um so 1,800 of those calls 3,345 hit our router and what I mean by this is depending on how much availability we have on the next day because our main goals for the sales at least is to keep the sales team full so of those 3,345 that hit less than 1K depending on the day uh are either going to to go to a DQ booking that's not going to fire the pixel and it's going to go to lower quality SL onboarding reps um if there's availability it'll go to those if there is not or the availab uh or there's lesser availability it's going to just knock them straight to a DQ uh low ticket page so they're not going to be able to book They're not going to be able to go through anything and then it's going to push them over here to the low ticket right same low ticket that we're running um direct paid traffic to so of those 3345 I don't have the exact numbers real quick um off how many landed on the DQ page versus the bridge page I could find it but it's just not really super relevant for this um and 1,53 made it through on the booking of the DQ okay so on right there we've got about what 2,800 calls yeah it's 2900 calls that happened over the month all right now low ticket they are coming in through paid and they're also coming in as this DQ Bridge okay now the actual paid properly started halfway to like last third of the month so these numbers are just kind of it's more so about the percentages than the total volume um because we were not actively running this and it was coming through low ticket which had different conversion percentages so for the low ticket checkout so of this we had um a thousand of them that opted in it's a two-step loow ticket so it's first name email and then going into uh phone 561 of them purchased so you've got whatever that is around 55% call it of a conversion rate of the checkout page so we had 561 that purchased and then of that we have 73 that booked a call with a Setter now those 73 came from like the last 150 of these purchases because this didn't even exist until less than a week ago right so the play here is uh low ticket direct as well as DQ full and pushing them through to check out then purchase then they're in the community they're in the product they're doing that and then uh pushing them to book a call with a Setter okay and now we only have two dedicated sets who do this we just added the second one four days ago we added the first one so these are flying in and then the percentage that I can give math once this actually like flashes out but so far these have insane uh show rates then Set Set uh set rates and then live call with closer show rates and then backed out close rate we already have like three units I think that have come from this and then from the main funnel where they pick up people on Setters uh we have another two I think units so far so like in a week we've closed like four or five units um and yeah so now now backing out to the actual terms and purchases 188 terrible so bad like when we were cranking it was like double that and not good so again that's that sales for booking number because based on all this amount of calls we've only had this now our no show or I'm sorry our show rates between cancels and no shows we had it was bad and that then directly affects how many live calls they are so how many they close Okay so that's a marketing and sales thing we're messing with marketing throughout the entire month optimizing for different events and trying to play with things now we have a new Mo in uh great media buyers guys who have done it run the Playbook so they're running low ticket and rebuilding the entire thing we're essentially like groundup building this so ground up with 110 employees while existing but like yeah it's a struggle it's a real struggle um so 188 was the new units Target is 400 plus okay now going into April 2025 the plan on this low ticket expansion so as of now we sell one thing on the low ticket so it's one aov one fix and is $37 I believe right now um and so expansion on that so low ticket overall this is technically in a three-way split so just off the Baseline we're trying to set or we're trying to set a baseline of what the frontend sales uh page conversion is what the checkout page conversion is the booking what percentage of those go down the funnel to then purchase book a call with the setter fill out the app uh then how many make it to a closer then how many close from that show rates like I need that full picture of math before we lean into any uh particular bucket but one the things we do is just slowly increase things from the front to back so our our uh um CMO talks about this like front to back front to back like we're solving for that as we go and then I'm just trying to get data base lines as we go across expansion around that is right now we don't want to optimize for aov through otos but we can through an order bump we can through these other ways so even just doing that we can offset because right now call it I don't want to give wrong numbers but like call it 60% maybe that we're doing liquidation right now on the front so call $30 net CPA back that in the whole goal being can we get people on the phone with the closer for $100 that close at higher than standard rates and then all of a sudden be at a 1ou a sub 10,000 CPA which is like a third of where we're at right now based on all this terrible math coming through the vssl bloated spend just bad right so loads to get expansion Setters same thing here optimizing around these flows right now they are hitting the app no book so people who fall off between um these so the 3500 and 1800 main focus on these non the D not the DQ ones so of those whatever I can't do that math real quick but whatever 1500 is I don't know uh of the 1500 is 1700 is uh they then hit those up and call them right now we have an AI bot that does that but that's inclusive of already what's in here so they're already doing the recapture and only getting to this percentage um so having a call team that does that is where they're at here and then also on these low tickets but we have cancel no shows we have uh custom booking uh request forms we have we just have like 19 different places they can hit up people so the goal here is to scale this team to call it probably 10 throughout the month right now we're at like three or four um optin we are doing uh new page Dev stuff CMO is you know there sees a huge lift on what we're doing with the optin page We've ran basically the same optin page for like four or five years and we've never properly tested it or had proper testing methods and that's both on me from tracking and marketing and not launching anything new and it just has been what it's been um so new OP are being built overall Facebook and Google for both low ticket and um and the vssl main funnel so like I said we're like from the ground up rebuilding this thing like heavily um so trying to keep everything baselined with metrics and not like launch new because we don't want to do that necessarily yet um but figuring out these numbers and then also properly launching them all on Google we have a really good Google media buyer that just came on sales team we are onboarding and ramping new and doing it in a way that is kind of a different approach right right it's a little bit more like um I don't say aggressive but like harder and more financially motivated very focused around you know if you want to make 20K a month which has been done in our company we had sales reps who made 350 400 whatever before I mean last year we had someone who did I think 320 and in the past we've had someone who made 400 uh in years prior so like the opportunity is there um so what are the math what's the math behind that if you want to make 20K a month how many calls you need 80 availabilities of those 80 50 you're going to show of those how many you close and like doing that in a way that where there's the boards for compensation or for uh motiv not motivation um you know what I mean so where there's boards to incentivize them properly and give them Clarity around numbers and competitions and all that so we're doing a new sales Round of hiring how that may change is depending on how we do DQ so if we full DQ which is what we're talking about doing where it just goes all into low ticket then you would be in a position where the actual quality bookings that hit the calendar or the actual just overall count would be like 40% less right if this is around 40% the bookings um but then you have an uplift now that would come from the Setters so you have Setters and uh the Quality Engine here that would increase that and then you also now have Setters that would come from low ticket or set calls that would come from low ticket so it likely would even out and just have higher quality on the uh calendar haven't fully decided that yet but very likely what will happen um and then we have to back into how many sales reps we need for that and then at scale retention team I talked about this that we rolled it out but we haven't fully rolled out tracking and like funnel steps um because I want to set up like full pipeline so when someone is 60 days out from retention they get a you know reach out to them basically what happens on the reach out did they want to schedule a call did they call schedule then no show cancel did they not want to talk on the phone like what are the outcomes of that and where is the current situation of the team because these these guys are sales reps and they have been and but they just have like like a ton of empathy and they love the product and they're into it so them in retention is amazing it's just how do we get the right people to be doing that actual job and how do I give them the system around it to do it and then what's the offer they can pitch which is huge because right now they're just pitching staying for another year which is like 1K less Department level kpi is on me so tracking um dashboarding uh agenda in all the different departments we have this at some level but they kind of all run on their own already and I just want to clean it up so it's all in one way and then brand faces we have multiple brand faces that we've launched but we just need to like roll them out more uh aggressively and just continue to scale into them and get better stats around it because we have not been backing out on units very well which is like obviously the key here it's been very difficult to see what brand faces work or don't in terms of like actual dollars per ad or whatever you want to call it versus cost per call cost per whatever which is already good on these new brand faces so that would say would work but yeah so all of this is just to say a lot of the marketing Ops this is like the part that I know and I'm you know functioning on there is 15 other things that are happening in fulfillment and sales and uh organic and all these other parts of the company where they are crushing it as well as having obviously some shortcomings too um but yeah that is not a this is not meant to be a reflection of them not doing anything it's just meant to be me talking about the parts I know and can accurately give uh insights on um but yeah the rest of the company is just crushing it we just need to help and fix acquisition so that the rest of company can Thrive with inflow of new um new clients so personal just a fun one if you don't care about this you can pop now 19 videos on YouTube 185 YouTube subs woohooo 30 DMS from that which is like this is kind of the goal right is like build a network around these of other high quality people so I've had a ton of people DM 30 something let's call it um I think it's even higher than that now but talking about their businesses sharing their numbers guys who are doing 1.5 guys who are doing 300K a month like all these different stuff which I love because then I get to see different funnels I get to talk about it I have some perspective but this whole thing is like no ego our way clearly is breaking even and not making money this month so like listen to who you want to but um that finished one inone oneon-one person one toone inperson coaching I've never had an inperson coach before and I did this year for like last six months maybe and very odd um for me because I do everything digital so going in person I finished that up finally it was like six months um and this was like a business SL like life coach you call it uh oneone personal training I'm a huge believer in we do what we do others do right energy is energy out so I want to pay for personal training pay like 10 GS for personal training because that's what people pay us I did it it was good but again in person not my jam fixed schedule on someone else's calendar like just not really my jam so did it all good fuel this is just funny one just meal planning all these other things that just come direct to the door so I literally don't have to leave this desk terrible planning March I did a terrible job of setting the calendar and intention and like what I'm going to do if it makes the calendar gets done and like I didn't even put things on the calendar so I need to fix that and then Puerto Rico stuff I can make a whole video on this but I lived in Puerto Rico for the last 3 years and had you know 4% tax and did that whole jam and and ended up moving out of there but like I'm closing everything out and finalizing it so this is kind of just my reminder to that March I 99% of the way closed it out and uh for like the tax year and stuff like that and plan into April Daily Post going to continue on with these videos of Daily Post I don't have outcome goals because I don't know the trajectory of this I don't know if it's consistent like linear or if it's more exponential I don't know the answer to that but like the input is a Daily Post New Biz coach I have this sicko guy that is um really well known the space and like lead gen and affiliate specific that I have worked with in the past when I was in a worst place in life maybe where I couldn't actually like effectively execute on what he we would talk about uh but now I feel like I'm in a good place so I am starting up with him completely remote new gym pick up heavy and that's kind of fun for me because I can go whenever I want and like this the only things I do I work I work out I eat and I hang out with my friends family girlfriend like that's about it like so new gem is exciting new paid group um I can talk about more on this in another video but essentially and a group of other people doing this so sharing content scaling info businesses and yeah and then planning tomorrow today back to this uh terrible planning the goal is to start planning in a proper way because if it hits the calendar I get it done all right so probably don't care about the personal part but fun metrics so uh yeah follow me on here follow me on Instagram for communications subscribe for YouTube and DM any comments any anything I don't care uh just let me know what you want to hear or find in the company and let me know talk soon by
