## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdSyAb9ujIo

In today's video, we're going to do a full breakdown on our funnel that has generated 119,473 calls. We're going to go through some quick data on how many leads and applications were generated to get those calls and then those calls turning into mid-t buyers, high ticket buyers, and the total cash collected. Then I'm going to do a full deep dive on every single step of the funnel, show you the pages, the automations, everything. And then if you stick around till the end, I'm going to go through yesterday's stats because I make these videos every single day. All right. Now, last year we did 30 million in cash collected and I make everything on this channel just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, first things first, leads inside of HubSpot. We have 1.15 as of this morning. Today's April 6, 2025 of those. Then 300Kish turned into applications, which is about 16 questions. I'll show you the whole thing below. 120,000 booked calls which turned into 12,000 midt buyers and I'm calling midt uh an old info product we used to sell that was anywhere from $500 to $1,500 high ticket buyers 9,000 which is for us right now a 7k annual ticket and total cash collected is 70,737,000 as of this morning all right now let's get into the funnel so this entire thing is a VSSL call funnel right so first things first is they are going to opt in so this page we're going to send them and there's variations of all of these like split tests and stuff like that. But this is the current control. So these page is where they're going to go to give us a name and email. All right. So first things first, all meta and Google traffic is going to go to an opt-in page and then from that opt-in page go to a VSSL page. This is our current VSSL page. We have this two or three-way split. And the big thing here is a majority of this is on mobile. So that apply now is showing right now, but it would not show when someone first pops on here. So we have mobile and desktop VSSLs. About 90% of the traffic is mobile. It's actually funny. We have a pretty high amount of tablet, too, just because of who our demo is. So this is the VSSL page. Now through here and here, we've collected their name and email, but we don't have their phone number. We don't have any of that. Okay. Next is going to push them to that application page. So if they stick around, different VSSLs are different lengths, anywhere from 22 minutes to 26 minutesish. Um, and towards the end of the video, the call to action, they get pushed to the apply page. So, here they're going to land on the application. This is about 16 questions that goes through where we collect a bunch of information on where they're currently at um, and where they're trying to go. And you can go through this kind of on your own time. Um, try and keep this short, but if you go through here, in here, it will get their phone number and a financial qualifier. So, this is new to us. Um, so we've never had this in here uh up until about 3 months ago. And I'll share that in the funnel um in the funnel map. So that's what I mean by router. So when someone answers this and says less than 1K, that's a big indicator for us because it has about half the uh quality score. So half the closing score as these other answers. So call it 5% on these and then the rest are 10 11 12% depending on these buckets. Okay. So there's going to be a router that happens. I'm going to go through the top main core part of the funnel and then go into all the breakdowns and show you. So, blue is essentially all of the sales, all the pages on site. Yellow is all the communication that happens via email. Red is going to be SMS and green is going to be a human. Okay. So, the router will then happen and anyone who is above 1K is going to get sent to a booking widget. So, they're going to get sent to this page right here where we do qualifying copy that basically like tells them not to book if they're not serious. And this is just a goal to make sure that we have as much quality as possible on the closer calendar. They can book 48 hours in advance. Um, so today plus, so like right now it's 6:00 in the morning, so they can't even book into this day because it starts at 8 a.m. on the calendars. Um, and then some cool custom U pieces that are if they can't find a time on here, they submit a request that goes to closers, setters, that whole jam. All right, so that's a booking page. Once they are successfully booked, they're going to land on a booking success page, which looks like this. basically tells them what to expect before the call. I'll go into some of the automations and why this part works, but watch a video that's a pre-framing video, look at some testimonials, and then watch a bunch of reviews. All right. Now, once they land on there, they are called they land on a closer calendar. All right. So, human and then land into a routing cycle where it's basically or not a routing cycle as much as a stage cycle. So, everyone is auto set as call scheduled. When the call is generated, they are 30 minute Zoom calls. And then from there, the calls then change to go to either a no-show, cancel. For us right now, uh we're getting like 50% show rates, which historically we've gotten closer to 60 plus. Um so that's something we're currently working on, but no shows and cancel. Hot listing is basically meaning that they are husband objection, financial objection, but they are qualified, right? So this just means like a follow-up like but short term. Uh long-term follow-up is somebody who's, you know, come back to me in three months or six months, but they're interested and they are qualified or they could be. DQ is just there's no way, disability, welfare, stuff like that. Close lost means they had the opportunity to do it. They were somebody who was qualified and could have, but the sales rep closed uh did not win the deal. And then closed one means they purchased, they're in the program, and then they go over to our terms page, which I have other videos on the channel why this is important, because this fires all kind of stuff for Facebook. All right. So that is the core top half of the funnel. Now anybody can do that. Anyone has that. Now the other pieces that occur are important extremely. So here all of the emails that are going to come from here from opt to app. Okay. So the first bucket of people we have are people who apply or uh opted in but did not apply. Now we only have their name and email. Okay. So they exist in HubSpot but what can we send them? So, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to send them back to a VSSL replay page. And this is going to be a struggle of me trying to find these. Um, this So, we'll send them to a VSSL replay page. It's basically just says, "Hey, watch the VSSL again. Uh, you know, confirmed." And then it is going to always have an application that it's going to push them to. So, this is one of the automations. So, for the push to apply. So, we're basically just sending email after email every single day that is pushing them back to pages like this or very similar that is getting them to re-watch the VSSL, consume more content, and then go down to apply. Okay, so that's what all of these push to apply emails are. Now, again, we can't SMS, we can't outbound, we can't anything except via email because we only have their email. We've ran tests in the past and for us at the time uh it did not back out for us to get the 20 30% drop in opt-in rate with adding a phone number because we weren't making more per person uh per lead. So like revenue per lead was not the same or was not high enough to justify the decrease. Okay. So we're going to send them to here and then this is like a big core page. We're going to send them to a VSSL bonus page. So in this VSSL it says, "Hey, if you stay until the end, I'm going to give you XYZ, right?" Um, so it's going to say you can get all these free bonuses which are XYZ guide or this or this or this if you stay till the end. So we send them to I believe where did I have it? This one. So we send them to this page and this is frame. This is a Becker thing that we learned like a long time ago. I don't know if this is still relevant but we still run it. Um, so it's basically your free bonuses are at the bottom. All this is mobile by the way. Everyone is going to go on mobile. Okay. So your free bonuses are on the bottom. has them here and it's just filled with apply now CTAs but it pushes consumption to them to watch the VSSL and then has asks them to apply goes down here and then claim your fee bonuses. So we have these four bonuses that if you stay to the end and these are like our biggest buyer pockets. So for us in this women's fitness niche uh menopause busy mom guide stopover training and ultimate guide to macronutrients are like our four main buckets of things. Um, so like menopause, mindset, muscles, macros, and uh these get claimed like crazy. So this will be the second email in this push to apply sequence. So it's basically like, hey, here's your first one. And the second one is here's your bonus access. And it's sent like within 20 minutes of after uh watching the VSSL. So everybody gets it even if they don't watch the whole VSSL. But the idea being someone stays to the end of the VSSL, you get it, right? So this page is huge. Um, this page is huge. And both of these generate a ton of traffic uh for us in application volume. So now someone's going to land on this application and like I said, if they answer above any of these, it is going to route them to this main booking widget. If it does not, they're going to land on a DQ booking page. Okay, the DQ booking page is identical, but it has no Facebook tracking. Okay, so I have other videos on this on how we train the pixel, but essentially this page just doesn't fire anything back to uh Facebook. This one does with the goal of having our schedule event that is firing only quality, only people who are the highest likelihood that they are going to convert. So those above than 1k people, right? They're also going to land on a scheduled success DQ page. Same thing doesn't fire the pixel, but it's an exact dupe. All right, now last piece on here. This was not been running up until like a month ago, so it's not really reflected in these numbers, but I'm just going to share. During the day, if we have not enough bookings coming into the next day, we'll let people book in as DQ. Okay, so the difference here on the widgets too on who they can book with on this portion is two different booking widgets dependent on the page. And these are going to be lower quality or reps who are, you know, not as high converting or new ramping reps. This is going to be that top quality uh reps. You have all the guys, sales trainers, hormone, whoever in the world that says match your top leads with your top closers. They cannot be compared direct in percentage of close, but there is a baseline of what we know because we do know the funnel quality traffic. And even if they're DQed, they might not be this level caliber, but they still do close. We still have whatever 5 to 7% of total of these that will close. So, it works. Okay. Now, we will send them to a low ticket if the calendars are full. So, we try and push as much quality as possible. overflow into D uh DQ just to make sure that the calendars have as much uh volume as possible and they have in their day. And then DQ is if the calendars are booked, we're just going to DQ them straight. And this DQ page looks like this. So we'll say, "Hey, your application was not uh immediately approved. Mandy from our coaching team or from our team, which is an AI bot, so like an SMS AI bot is going to reach out with a couple more questions, but join this ultimate guide." This ultimate guide is then a low ticket that we are actively running and building out. This is the old version, but it's currently in a VSSL split, so ugly as can be, but converts. Okay, so this is a piece that I'm not going to go into fully in this video, but we're fully running low ticket. I have other videos on the channel. Um, yesterday we did 60 units of this low ticket um both through this and also direct traffic. Okay, now going to the automations. So like I said, yellow is going to be email, red is going to be um SMS, and green is going to be human. So yellow, first thing you have is push to book email. So push to book exactly the same as what you'd look like as for push to apply. So you're going to have everybody who has applied but not booked, right? So these are like high intent people. They just spent 16 17 questions, so however many minutes that is, 7 to 11 minutes depending um filling out the application but then just didn't book. Did they not find a time they like? Did they not uh know it was a call? Did they not whatever. So we send them a full push to book sequence and we send it to them 3 minutes after. if they applied but didn't book. Should only take up to 3 minutes to find the spot you want and book in. And then uh every day we send them an email all contextual pushing them back to book. Now, important thing we just learned on this is I actually have a dupe of this out that Oops, SMS was supposed to be there. Um, but I pushed a book out that is uh AI based that is for SMS and then these are both routed depending on if they answered less than 1K and if they answered above that they will go to the dedicated pages so that you keep the pixel clean. Okay, so big key there to where the DQ ones only can book through the DQ widget instead of just sending them all back to the main booking page and then pixeling everybody with not quality traffic. All right. Push to book DQ is what I was going to there. And this is what I meant to do. Oops. Knew I messed something up for you guys. All right. Now, the last piece on here is push to book setters. So, we have a channel that is completely dedicated. And I can't show Slack because it has too much like customer personal information in it, but push to book setters. This is newer to us in the last like month. So, again, non-reflective of these numbers, but the push to book for setters is the same thing. So they basically get everybody who applied but did not book, they'd land in a Slack channel rated with uh like bells. So it'll be no but none for the less than 1K, one for the 1 to five, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 plus. And they're and they're just bells on them so you know which ones to prioritize. And this is huge for us. So like right now I have all these trackers open on other screens but so for us our setters right now on those that bucket of leads is converting at 60% show rate and 12% live call rate which is great right so that is both a marrying and this is like them ramping okay and that's directly out of that bucket almost exclusively okay now went through all these pages went through the DQ success through here now what happens when somebody books a call right all right next piece is going to the the pre-all emails or like call confirmation emails. These I have another entire video on this. Uh our show rates are not the best. None of this is meant to say this is exactly the way to do this or the the triedand-true like perfect way. Um we're constantly testing things, figuring it out. So for our pre-all setup, we have a call that come or an email that's going to come from the sales rep immediately. Um we have this which is huge. As soon as someone books, lands in a Slack channel and we have a 20our a day, 7-day a week triage team that calls them. If they don't answer, calls them again, leaves a voicemail, and texts them. Okay? And the entire thing is like, you need to confirm your call. Just making sure that you know it's a Zoom call. Just making sure that you know that it's uh central time zone. Is that all good? Cool. All right. Boom. Go into HubSpot, check off that they're confirmed. If they do not confirm, they sit in this unconfirmed bucket. Stats around this for us. The ones that confirm have a 40% higher close rate blended, right? Crazy. and show rate is 20% higher. So on average we'll get 70% of the ones that confirm actually show and then of the others it's you know 40 or something like that. So it's like 30ish% depending and then it blends out to our 50ish number. Right now pre-all emails that's going to be from the sales rep. Then pre-all SMS is going to send 30 minutes after that from that's AI infused from a sales rep that's going to say hey uh I saw your application. AI is going to look at the application, feed in some thing, and say, "I see that you're 35 and looking for this, this, and this. Uh, here's a site, a page from our site that I think is going to be valuable for you to watch. Did you get the link?" And it's going to ask them that, start up a conversation. And that entire thing is dynamic AI, but sent through the sales rep. All right, we have the Calendarly ones, the automated, we have a couple emails that exist throughout that, but those are the core ones that actually like get the response rates, but then increase the show rates. And again, none of this say this tried and true in the way to do it. This is how we do it right now. Not the only way to do it. So, land on a sales call with a closer, go through these stages. I kind of went into these, but these all have their own automations that live within them. So, when someone no-show cancels, it feeds back into a bucket that then the setters are going to hit. The hot listing ones feed a follow-up pipeline. The long-term follow-up feed a longer term follow-up pipeline. DQ fully out, close loss. There's like a winback style sequence. Um, and then yeah, all that is stored in there. So, tried to go through that as quick as I could. Um, and now let's get into yesterday's stats. So, yesterday we did 725 leads. We did 301 applications, 81 calls. So, this is crazy for us. I have other videos talking about this, but like we are not in a good position right now. I'm glad I'm making these videos cuz like we're in a good position going into the future, but like day on day cash is like not good just because we have all these marketing things we're changing and then also ramping new sales reps doing them at the same time. Not ideal. Um, so 300 apps and 81 calls. So, what that means on a marketing standpoint, because this number is usually way higher for that many apps, but that just means that everyone's getting DQed or a lot more are getting DQed. Uh, and also our call calendar or our availability on the calendars into the weekend today, Sunday is generally lighter, a little bit lighter. Um, so there's not really places for them to book. So, less availability or options than overall less avail or less booked calls. So, DQing a ton of people plus that. Only 81 calls yesterday that were booked. We had four high ticket buyers which is low for us something on this um because that's like sevenish% and I can actually put a better one. This is how many calls were generated not how many calls were had on day. So this is like the marketing side and then this is the backed out sales side. Um so four high ticket buyers which was actually on day yesterday was only 56 calls on day even though 81 were generated because they can book out 48 hours in advance. Right. So yesterday we had a four units that were actually closed low ticket. I have a whole I can do a whole another video on this, but we have a whole funnel now that feeds off of this and then also gets its own dedicated traffic. Like 90% of them are coming from the dedicated traffic, which is great. New CMO is a rockstar. Um, so low ticket buyers, we had 60 and total cash collected is 37,000. And this is cross company. Uh, some a little bit of active revenue, but mostly new. So that's what I got. I make all these videos just to share this and then so I can look back and be like wow this is where we were and then also like I said find great talent of people who can help us do this in a better way opportunities of other companies and uh softwares and everything and network of people who are doing the same. I just want to jam with people and have friends in the space that are doing the same thing. All right. So, YouTube algo, likes, shares, comments, all the things. Uh Instagram for com uh communication or any ideas you have on what I should be doing. And I will talk with you guys soon.
