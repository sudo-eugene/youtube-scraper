# How I’d Pivot Industries & Scale from $20k → $1M | EP102
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yu01x18IIQ

What's up, guys? Back with a weekly weekend Q&A round eight. Doing this one solo. You guys submitted these questions to the request box over the last week and today I'm going to answer every single one of them. For some quick context, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 77 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year in this business. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so I'm on a time crunch, so let's get into this one. We've got bubble stuff and nicotine. So, let's hit it. What do you do with your money? Oh, man. I haven't read these, by the way. You don't talk much about what you purchase, invest in, or travel, etc. Yeah. Um, I don't really talk about that stuff a lot. Like, I talk about numbers, but it's more about like they're just numbers on a screen. Like, it's just scale. It's it's skill acquisition. It's growth in that way. Like, my real my real goal is like progression. Um, I have, you know, some nice stuff. Um, I like, you know, some of the luxuries of things, but yeah, it's not really like a big piece. Um, years and years ago, uh, I was, you know, crazy and partied and did a bunch of crazy stuff and made a bunch and spent a bunch like an idiot and, you know, regret it, but also like I did it and it's over. So, all good there. Um, invest in not a ton. You know, I do the crypto fun stuff that's like x small amounts that can turn into 100xes and some just dumb stuff for like fun. Um, and then I have, you know, a decent chunk of some of the other kind of core coins, but that's about it. Um, and then some random, you know, indexes and stuff, but I keep a lot in cash just because I'm like in a place where I want to make sure that I have X amount. And right now is a lot of setup for some of like the future stuff. But we're really doing like the whole, you know, reinvest into it, which can also just be like a ploy and maybe I'm an idiot and maybe we should be pulling more out. But we really are trying to, you know, build up some re reserves and make some bigger plays uh, and all the things. But some things are based for cash flow, some are based for equity growth. really right now I'm just trying to increase my over my overall skill set and progression to have a you know skill set that makes a lot lot lot lot lot lot more add zeros to it. Um so yeah it's a big focus of mine right now. So that's where I'm focusing. Um in terms of traveling uh I'm not a super fan of that. I don't really like to go look at the waterfalls. I am going to make a more conscious effort to like get off the laptop and do that every 90 days or so. Um I've done a really bad job of that and I think it's actually important. Next one on here info to SAS timeline. I'm not really sure what you mean on that. Um I'm not moving in that direction. I think maybe referring to the fact that a lot of people do that and do do and do that like business plan or like growth plan. They build an info coaching business. They try and build a SAS either on the back of it or in like you know a a similar niche and that's not really in the cards for us. Like there could be tech plays but they're not as so much softwares. we did have this conversation, but like I don't know. For me, I didn't find that what we were going to be able to build was be able to build was going to be unique enough and like I'm techy, but I'm not that techy. Um, so even though like I built the infrastructure, the tech of our thing, it's not like, you know, rocket science or like really new innovation. It's just like, you know, connecting a lot of systems and understanding data structure and stuff like that. And even that I'm not the best at. So, um, yeah, that's not really in the cards as much right now, but I love SAS. I think it's really cool. I think like I I love the business model. And again, I don't understand the tech enough to probably run my own or do stuff. Plan to start a new project in the health and fitness space. Info only, no coaching, smart. And want to focus heavily on recurring revenue and want to build for an exit. Okay. Think Mind Valley but for health and fitness. Who do you knows the best in the info recurring game? What makes a good membership in your opinion? How do you get people in there and how do you retain them? And any people, channels, books you can recommend? Um, so all right, let's use an example. So there are a ton of these apps uh that are personality based. So like when you say Mind Valley, the thing I think is then like um Iman's digital launchpad or mastermind.com or these other ones where they own the IP, they have all these different expert experts and brand faces and stuff whatever inside there. So it like gets a lot of different eclectic people um that can then come in and also the goal is then not one of those single people is tied to the front of it for acquisition so that you don't get tied to the personal brand thing which is very common in the health and fitness space where you have someone like um Rob was on here for example and Rob was talking about how he has you know thousands of members that pay for his monthly recurring app um which is you know hundreds of thousands of income all this thing but it's all tied to him both on the fulfillment like he's the one in the product and he's also the one doing the acquisition um because they come through his organic following. So, there are other ones that have sold um I'm forgetting the name, but I think I might be butchering this, but I think it was the Sweat app. I think that one sold for hundreds of millions, but then like tanked down after and that was around a personality brand. I don't know that exactly, so don't quote me on that, but it's definitely a big game to be in um for this portion. What makes a good membership? I'm still like I bought a bunch of books if you follow me on X and I'm like trying to understand this better and better. Um there's a lot of SAS books that'll tell you about this in a good way. There's a lot of community management, you know, how to how to never lose a customer, like those things. Um, that's all about just LTV and how you focus on that. So, it's activation points, it's um, you know, everything's so important as the activation right in the beginning, the inflection points in the middle, like I'm not I'm not the pro on this, by the way, but like reasons that think about like a Netflix, right? They always say like you want it so that they would be pissed if their subscription didn't go through and they couldn't access it anymore, right? So, it has to be so sticky and such like a need. Um, I think Hyros does a really, really good job of this because they one have a direct ROI justification, which you won't have on this because you're not doing something that's financial, but they have a direct ROI justification and they also then have all the data. They have all this stuff. Like they have all of the tools in there and then once you're kind of like in the web, same thing with HubSpot, right? Like last I heard they had a whatever it's called negative net churn. So like they're increasing up and the right and like we've done the math or the rough math, napkin math on what it would cost us to switch off HubSpot at this point. Like when we switched from close.com to HubSpot, the decrease in efficiency and the time it took and the cost and whatever to migrate platforms was so big and like now that we're XYZ bigger, like people do it, but it is so difficult to jump off that. So really creating a web in terms of health and fitness of like why they need to come back into there. Um same thing with like how My Fitness Pal dominated the market for XYZ amount of time until now. There's obviously like other competitors that people use instead, but like they were the one that people went to because they owned all the library because people then had all their data in there. It's like once you get all your data in there and people want to use it and reference it. Same thing with like an aura ring where there's like competitions and leaderboards and like you just have just read those books honestly. So go to my ex. I posted a picture of a bunch of books I got and a bunch of people recommended. I made one on there um that was really good. Also comment below in this and just like I love the comments on these and it gives me so much feedback. Like I had a video the other day that you guys didn't like because of a person I didn't vet supposedly. And like I didn't really like I just was referred to him a couple times, got on, had a conversation and like it's good feedback. I mean you guys were pretty kind to me, but you were not so in the other direction. And like I get it. It's totally cool and like that's on me for not vetting. Um but I like when you guys comment and you give the feedback and go back and forth like if you think this or this like I'm going to do what I want no matter what. So just be candid here. But like I like to hear what you guys think and kind of navigate that uh and make decisions then based on some of your feedback. So just FYI um how do you figure out how to how much to pay yourself and the co-founders in early stages of the business and later stages. Um so I mean simple math but you know you have a partner and you're 50/50 you guys take 50/50. The not so simple is if one is like more operating and one is just owner and there's like different agreements on that. Like you can do this literally any way you want. Um a big thing in info coaching is you're supposed to just take as much of the money basically out as you know you can that's safe. So, you know, based on payrolls, based on expected expenses, based on whatever, if you have future coaches, you need to like factor in how much cash that's going to cost into the future, like all that kind of stuff. You need to be strategic with it. But like the idea is there shouldn't really be reinvesting that occurs. Um, and when you reinvest, like even back to this question, I don't know if I said this on this, but like you know, we're reinvesting back in, which really means we're just like keeping a lot of cash in right now. Um, both for future expenses, both for growth that we're planning, all this kind of stuff. But generally speaking, like that's kind of dumb and like we might be dumb doing it. Like I I'll be the first to say um because generally speaking info coaching you don't need you shouldn't need to reinvest. You have money in you have money out right you're selling XYZ it cost you X amount to acquire customer cost you X amount to pay sales rep cost you X for fulfillment and that's your spread and like you take the rest out that's for you team whatever um you need to leave X amount in the company whatever number that is you need to be you know cognizant of that. I've heard people say you know six weeks of runway I've heard people say four weeks I've heard people say you know burn it and burn the boats and make more and like I don't know. So, I don't know if I'm the best for that, but we basically just keep enough cash that makes sense um as like essentially like working capital, but we don't have like an ecom business, for example, needs to keep a ton in there because they have inventory on shelves. They have working cap like all the things they need inside the business. Info coaching is a lot leaner. So, you don't need that. It's all just based on what you need for to operate the business and like what needs to stay in there for it to continue to run and grow. If you have ad expenses coming up, if you have things like that to continue your growth, you need to leave that type of stuff in there that it kind of constantly always makes sense. But make sure you're just not in the hamster wheel where you like think you're reinvesting when really you're just like not pulling money out and just building something like again we did this we did this at one point. So and are kind of still doing this. So yeah. Um how do you know uh you've tested something enough before changing it? Completely depends on what you're testing. Um there's certain numbers and metrics of volume. So you know 50 optins or 500 optins or um like for us a lot of the time we tie everything back to the dollars. So, even if something has like way more opt-ins in the beginning, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to get more sales. And I use this example in a lot of videos, but I talk about how basically like you could have one opt-in that's like, "Here's how you're going to get this free car, and the other one's like, "Here's going to be the hardest workout of your life, and you're never going to be able to complete it, and it's going to take forever for you to get the body of your dreams." One's going to get a way lower opt-in rate, and the other one's going to get a much higher, but one might is going to get more sales because it's more congruent for what you're actually selling. Um, so we tie everything back to the dollar. So in that case, you really just want to test it to what your conversion mechanism portion is. So if it's a sale, uh if it's a low ticket sale, if it is calls booked, if it's whatever, you can make decisions. Um but you usually want to test this a bit longer than you think because there's also other various variables about like if you're running paid, for example, if you have different organic pieces like the content matters, too. The context of what the content they're coming from matters, whether that's an ad, whether that's a certain landing page, whether that's whatever. So we usually lean a little further in this direction of like let it run for a while to see what really shores out as the winner. um over you know seven 14 21 days depending on how much volume you're doing. Um but yeah and you also like at some level you kind of want like a pretty clear winner more so than like a two one or two percent like yes those would add up when you do them across a funnel like one and twos and fives and whatever um but to all to say like it is pretty important that you have like a clear winner um and you'll know when you have one. Do you offer insurance benefits to employees? Yes. Uh if so what do you offer and how do you do it in a cost-ffective way? We've been looking to offer healthcare and it's expensive. Correct. But I know it's attractive uh benefit for employees. So ours we run everything through rippling. Uh we run Gustto for a while when majority of the team was 1099 and just like the in-house like core core team was W2. We flipped 90 whatever 5% except like some of the actual like true true contractors. Um because we operated with everyone as contractors and then we moved into like running the business where people were going to be employees and like where we had like actual cadence requirements and all that stuff. Um so at that point we moved everyone over to W2 um to like scale into the future. We actually did that all too early in my opinion. Um, because one, we didn't need the team to operate like they were W2 and like do the XYZ criteria because there's like legality to that in the US. Um, and we were really, you know, operating in a 1099 fashion. We truly were. Um, so we moved everyone over and then yeah, moved everyone into Ripling W2 and then we use a a tool that's connected to that. So they have like different offerings. So does Gustto, so does whatever. And um I think where we landed on this the most recent time uh is we have like a flat amount that we cover per if they opt in and then they can choose any of these plans they want that are like within XYZ criteria and then they pay their spread um up down all all the way to like a little bit like a couple hundred they pay you know we pay our few hundred if they opt in. they can either pay their couple hundred a month per pay period, whatever, and then or they can like go up to like these much bigger ones, but then it begins to come out of their portion because yeah, different people do this different ways. Like I have a buddy that works at uh like a local large university um and they have like insane they have like full full benefit like craziness. They have like you know 2 to1 41k match like it kind of comes down to you like there's like minimum requirements and then there's like you know the sexier offers of them. So ours is, you know, somewhere in the middle slash like higher end. Helping a creator monetize their audience by collecting emails and pushing them to a low ticket recurring paid community. What's the 20% I should on to achieve their 90 80 results? Please give me any pointers if you have any. Yeah, so this is great. Um, so by collecting emails and pushing them to a low ticket. So the other way a lot of people do this is push them to a free community first. So have a really good offer. Um, or if you're doing this like pushing I assume when you're saying collecting emails, you're doing some sort some sort of free lead magnet. I've heard we haven't really done it super. We do have free community and then a paid community and a low ticket. It's not recurring. Um and it comes with a community. So I kind of have some reference point here on like what or experience more so and what we've done. Um but I know a bunch of people will do a lead magnet and then yeah, you're going to email them. If you get um phone number, you can dial them. But to a low ticket recurring paid community, it's all about what the offer is for the paid community. Like why are people actually joining this? What is the recurring aspect of it? Like why does someone need to have continuing access and pay recurring? Like if it's a one time education doesn't make sense for example versus if there's like a community or like coaching calls or or growth that happens or month one then month two month three like they get information that's different they get access or they grow in XYZ way so they need different information like that kind of stuff is important for recurring or it doesn't make sense to have recurring. It only makes sense to have a low ticket one time and then you can send them into a higher ticket if the offer changes. Um but yeah I mean I like the free community one a lot. Um I know a lot of people do Telegram groups. I know a lot of people do WhatsApp groups. I know a lot of people do like different ways to do this portion because it's like all you're doing here is owning an audience. So there's also the people again like Rob who I talked about in fitness that pushes them direct to a low ticket recurring um paid app that has a community that has group coach that has like these different pieces of it. Um so yeah, so 8020 is that. So make sure that you have good CTAs in your stuff. Make sure you're providing a lot of value here. Make sure you have a good offer for the free thing for the lead magnet. Make sure you have a really good offer for the paid thing. Make sure that the recurring paid makes sense to be recurring. Um, but yeah, hopefully that was helpful. What are the top three problems, issues every info business faces and has constraints about why do they have those issues and how to solve them? Oh man, top three. Consistency is probably a big one. Uh, hamster wheel of content, even if it's paid, uh, a lot of the time it's a hamster wheel of content. Um, consistency in inflow, stickiness, uh, or LTV is a big one. So once people come in and buy an info thing, they don't buy something else because you don't have another offer that makes sense or you don't have the the ascension or you haven't achieved it. So it's very difficult to sell the next layer because what's the next layer? Um which is also stickiness. I don't even know if I've said three. I think I said three, but let me think of some other good ones. What are other issues that people have? Um they understand one portion of the business, not another, which isn't necessarily an issue, but like for example, someone really masters organic, but then has the organic issues that can maybe be solved by paid, but they only understand organic. Same thing with paid. Like for us, we're very very heavy on paid and haven't really cracked organic. So like we have the issues of costs and consistency around, you know, we get really good consistency, but like when it goes, it goes and like that's an issue. Um yeah, I mean those are those are some good enough ones. And Sultanic OG, he's a G. Uh nothing held back Facebook group. Check it out. I point like tons of you guys in DMs over there. It's a lot of media buyers, copywriters, um offer owners, like people who are kind of like run the internet behind the scenes of the offer game. Um, and it's a huge group now, but he has a couple paid communities and I'm in DMs with him right now to set up a call. So, uh, or a video for YouTube. So, we don't know when we're going to do it because we're both or he's he's got a lot of things on the plate. So, we'll see. Um, how to make a mid ladder ascension seamless. I want to run a low ticket AI info product, a mid ladder, and then my main agency. I have a low and high figured out. Why? Uh, what's the middle? So, you don't need a middle. Uh, so let's just debunk that. So like we'll sell something that's sub $50 as an info product and then get them not even into an agency done for you offer. We'll do another like done with you that's you know 5 to 10k. It's a you know whatever. So you don't have to have a mid. Um a lot of the time ascension is going to be implementation in this kind of example. So it's like you're selling something over here that's info that teaches them how to do xyz but they have to do it all on their own. The mid could be something that's like oh we'll offer you personalization coaching calls one-on-one launches whatever like personalization in that. So, let's say this is $100. Then you can offer for $500 if you want a mid. You can be like, "Yeah, or we'll do a quick start with you. We'll get on with you. We will, you know, get everything set up. We'll get all your infrastructure. We'll help you set up your accounts. We'll help you ideate on the first idea and whatever." And you pay a coach or you just do it yourself. And you pay them, you know, a hundred bucks to do each one of these calls and you make another 400 bucks in spread. And they just get access to that and they get the help from the coach, but they just get access to the course. And then they move up to the agencies. It's like, "We'll just do it for you. They'll just do it for, you know, 25 GS or five grand or performance-based or whatever." Um, so it's pretty easy to do those um or simple not easy um pretty simple to align those because it's just like what is the next layer of implementation for the same information that exists within here and that's how a lot of these guys do it. So again back to Alen Sultanic he has that in automatic clients was his like big launch to the space um or his big launch where he was actually like on the front of it. He's done massive launches. Uh in one of your previous Q&A you mentioned you know some guys who have built out branded Instagram and Tik Tok pages and sell them for tens of millions of dollars. Could you elaborate on buying and monetizing those pages work and how they ultimately exit for that much? Okay. So, what I had said was that I knew people who built these that are kind of like more local to where I'm from and the guys crush and like yeah, it's it's cool. Like they they've just gotten really really good at it and so I've heard like I've I've talked to them a couple times and heard some stuff and like they crush and I respect it a lot. Um, but they I then heard them and then other people in like the space talk about how some of these bigger ones have sold for tens of millions of dollars when they build up a big brand. And I'm forgetting the name off the top of my head, which completely defeats the purpose, but there's someone that built one up that was really big in the sports niche and sold um, and they sell to kind of either some of these like bigger conglomerate media companies or they then get brought under those and then get, you know, comp plans that do that. But they build up these massive brands and then have authority and audience where they can then monetize them through ads, through attention in whatever XYZ way. um they have partnerships, they have like all these different things that they can do to monetize um because they have an audience. So it's the same way that if you just have a big, you know, your own organic audience, these guys have them under branded pages. So they're like, you know, facelessish, right? And a lot of them are actually full faceless um and yeah, and they're doing things around sports or they're doing things around science or they're doing things around um you know, XYZ thing, dogs, whatever. And they build up these big pages and those have big monetization that they can make. And so yeah, so same thing with once you get into that game, they have like usernames that sell for crazy like, you know, someone messages me and like, "Oh, I have this list of usernames for sale that are anywhere from like 2K to like, you know, 40k and they flip usernames. Um, they sit on usernames and sell them later." Like all this kind of stuff or handles, I guess. I don't even know what they call them. I'm not really in this game. Um, but yeah, so we bought one way way back when. Actually, a really funny story about this. Um, I had heard about those guys doing it. I was doing some other random stuff, trying to like build pages, trying to like figure out online while also just doing a bunch of things and being an idiot. And uh I had some buddies that found one and we bought one that was in like the outdoor like van niche and we had someone come in and like that was kind of like a partner was like the wife of one of the guys and she came in and did all the content for it and we built up this thing like hundreds of thousands of followers like relatively quick which is nothing nowadays. I know people like speedrun to millions, but like I don't know. It was cool for us at the time and I was probably like 21, which again was like early on in my online internet world. Probably actually I was under 21, but it was that was early in my online career. Uh now you guys are 17 and making like a million dollars a year, so shout out you guys. Um but they we built it up. We got it like up to these big numbers. We had like massive celebrities reaching out that were like, "Oh, we want to rep it." We had like XYZ people, let's just say, that wanted to like wear the shirts and do all these things and like country people, country stars and like all these things and we were making swag and all of that and all of a sudden we couldn't log in and we're like what? What? Like we couldn't we couldn't log in. We couldn't log in and they had changed it all over to us and we were such idiots. We didn't realize that people could reclaim usernames and reclaim accounts when they owned the original like Gmail or whatever it was or whatever email account. And we were so stupid we didn't get the initial email. So, we lost the account and they took it and they monetized it big and then it got flipped out and then they tried to make one under another brand name and it just kind of like flopped and it was a pain. So, side tangent. Uh, dude, this guy's crushing. Okay, I'm not going to look at that now. Um, I'd love to know about books that shifted the way you think about your business and life. Um, I have some OG stuff. I got put on to all this when I was like 15 into like the personal development game and I read all the books and I was so jazzed and hype and like kind of a douche and just like egoy and whatever and I was like stoked about everything and like big vision and all this stuff and I had zero skills so it like torched me and then like life just happened and like I was an idiot and I didn't really learn skills for a long time and then I flipped it on its head and then went full skills with no mental terrible like insecurity, terrible like mindset, all that stuff and just like only did the skill oriented things and then yeah just  lived in a cave and like just worked for a long time and like with a lot of other stuff actually I was not just working but I was just doing the skill thing and not having a good mindset all to say. So some of the big books though I've revisited uh in the mindset game and some of the courses actually reintroduced me. So um Becker had a really good one at the time. There's a lot of guys that came out with them that like basically put as a pillar in their program that like mindset mindset mindset was so big. And so I watched a lot of that and kind of got back into that game. You know, what's your morning formula? Like even if I didn't have morning routine, it's like reviewing these goals, actually setting them, actually, you know, jamming them, putting them in front of your face. And like I have still sticky notes like to this day that I put in front of me um that are like what are the next core goals and I keep them like by company for personal items for stuff like that. Um so I think all of those have been released now on YouTube, but a lot of people have like synthesized them down. I'm a big believer that, you know, nothing's really new. It's just kind of like synthesizing what people's perspectives and how they package it. Um, so a lot of those and then there's some core like original books like some of the, you know, see you at the top, Zig Ziggler stuff, some of the um, psychocybernetics like some of those like OG ones. I have whatever 10 of those that are probably in the first 20 books I ever got that I you know in this era of life um that I have and then I have a ton of skill-based ones that I've I don't really like. I really only like story biography stuff now and then anything that's like time tested. So like OG marketing stuff, um OG mindset stuff and then everything else is now podcast, YouTube videos, paid courses, all that. Did you mention in a video that one of they sign up, they're served a series of ads and one they see ads and the same one again they removed the next one. Yes. Is that what you do? How you said? Yes. Okay. So this is go watch Jeremy Haynes. Um so he's going to be on the podcast this week. He's going to be on I just called it a podcast. It's not a podcast. Uh it is just me talking to people, but uh he's going to be on my YouTube on I think Tuesday of this week. So today is June 22nd. So unless anything goes wrong, it'll be live somewhere in between June 22nd and June 29th. But go to his page and he talks about the hammer them strategy and it's essentially people who book a call but haven't yet gotten on the call. And for that you are just going to hammer them strategy, right? With ads and it's going to be once they see one and have a through play, it excludes them from that video and moves them to the next. So it's essentially just a bunch of exclusions that exist within each one. So everyone's targeted and then once they see one, they're removed from the next one, move from the next one, and it goes down like this waterfall. So they go through all those. So it's pre-objection blocks, it's authority content, it's long form reviews, it's short form reviews, it's compilations, it's whatever. So what would you do starting from zero? How would you learn X skills? Even if it includes you making money at the first to pay for a course, how would you build your income so your skills continue to grow? Um h how would you learn X skills? YouTube has literally everything at this point. So I would just do YouTube and I would just hammer that and then I would sell a service um because you need very very little. I would get whatever kind of like localized job. I do think it's cool to get jobs. Okay, so you could either do like some hourly something local. I'm so bad at this because this is I can't even like put my head in that frame. Um I would go work something local and do just XYZ to like you know pay the bills or you know get by and then you can learn everything for free and then you can sell it as a service which costs you nothing to sell it and cost you nothing to service it except your time and with that you can get to 10 20k a month like all good just what you learn for free then you can like deepen down to that niche. Another really good way is like you can get in as a setter uh or into sales for online companies and then you get basically get like paid to learn. You do need some skills already in that, but like you can cut your teeth doing it. It's not like one you have to like come in like fully vetted. Um so that's a really good one. Um same thing kind of with media buying, but it's a little bit harder because you need to kind of like spend your own money a little bit to get like the gist of it. But there are people out there um that take in essentially newbies if you're friends with them. So you're in the right communities. So yeah. So hang out in the free communities, hang out on, you know, a bunch of free YouTube videos. people have full, you know, four-hour courses on how to start agencies or do whatever XYZ and service work, whether that's media buying where you can learn online, whether that is um so like getting people clients, uh whether that's web design and like local website builds, whether that is AI as a service, you know, like there's all these different ones you can do. So, you can do all that for free. Hey man, love the content. Heard you mention a couple times about upselling from info to sub uh to phys to physical product, which definitely makes sense. As an ecom guy, I'm keen to hear if the reverse works. So, selling uh relevant info to pre-existing ecom customers. Anyone doing this? We're in the baby niche. So, up guy uh upselling guides like on this. For some reason, I feel like it's less viable in the info. No, it is not less viable. Um there are definitely people who do this. Like for example, we have tested doing partnerships and stuff and for XYZ reason, we're not doing it right now, but where they sell us our info or refer over our info uh after they sell a physical product and it worked. uh conversion rate was kind conversion rate was kind of low because of the big the biggest thing was the consumption. So because we were sending them from imagine someone buys a $50 supplement and their customer is your customer. Okay? Or in your case they buy it from you and it's you know in this in this what do you say niche? Um baby niche. So you sell baby products whatever $50 and then you try and push them over either into your course or somebody else's course. Usually someone else's course because you're partnering usually you send them over there and it's like five grand. Like there's a huge discrepancy. They have no idea who this person is. they have no consumption of this unless it's like some crazy good offer that's perfectly in alignment like your conversion rate is just going to be lower. So what you can do is like step them into it or you can also do like you said like low ticket guides like yeah you can 100% sell guides. There's people who just do massive amounts of volume selling guides and do $100 million a year in selling parenting and baby and whatever guides. Uh and they use them as like the catalog approach. So you sell one you have like direct response but they can consume and like find other ones that are on your site. Um so they do that with infodirect. So, as long as it's the same customer and then the consumption thing is big. So, like if you are the one who owns the offer and they now bought something from you or they consumed a bunch of organic or whatever, like who cares if it's a physical product or an info product or a coaching product or whatever. Um, it's just they want it's the results. It's like as long as you're getting them the results, they're in there and they have the consumption or like the brand trust and the awareness of you, then you should be good. So, yes, I think you can definitely do this. Uh, I would try and build them yourself. You can build stuff like this, like these guides, super super cheap and good. uh as long as you do I mean we like really high quality so not just in terms of like it looks pretty but like it's actually functional and has like you know can get results so I would focus on building those try it in-house you can also find people to do partnerships to test with if you want split 5% of your email list or whatever send some blast to it see what your opens are see what your clicks are see what your conversion rate is what your dollar per you know email send is all that kind of stuff so I would do that drink some bubbly love your content, Ryan. Thank you. Would love to know how you'd go about scaling my offer to a million per year while keeping my margins 80%. So, I haven't done this, so let's be very clear here. I'm going to try and help, but I have not done a million a year with 80% margins in our business model. Uh, for contacts, my offer is a BTOC coaching offer ran completely off organic. Okay, that saved you 30%. Mainly from YouTube, doing between 10 to 20K a month. So, you just need to go you need to 4x and the big bottleneck is booking more calls. Call volume is very inconsistent is what I was talking about earlier and just depending on how the videos perform each month. also have a small following on IG but not posting too much. Would you start running paid ads to scale and if so what platform? How would you go about scaling to organic with 100K per month? So it's again I haven't done this so this is just me spitballing. Um but so it's just more of the same right like if you are doing two videos a month and it's not true that you just like double your videos necessarily but like you need to get let's say two videos a month is a bad example. Let's say you're getting 20,000 views a month and 20,000 a month turns into $20,000. Let's just say just for simple math, you need to get to the point where the same audience quality, whatever is there, where you get to 100,000 views to get 100K per month. Extremely stupid simple example. And again, not my world, not my expertise, but essentially that is how these bigger guys do it and do it at more volume is because they grow in terms of how they do that. So whether that is more videos, whether that is better quality videos that get higher amount of views and consumption and all that, whether that is multiple channels so then you're seeing they're seeing you on Tik Tok and Instagram and wherever and then it all feeds back to the main thing. It's growing the audience to the size and I don't know how big your TAM is or what, but like 100K month's not really crazy. Um the other thing, so like that's the front end, right? That's how many clicks, that's how much like right there. So it's, you know, increase views. Let's just assume that when you increase views, the same quality. So now you're going to get the same conversion rate. So you keep your whatever 2% conversion rate, but now you have double the amount of volume. So now you get double the amount of calls, let's just say. Okay. The other is then what you are selling them or the funnel is actually the next step. So can you get that conversion rate higher? Can you make the offer for them to book a call better? Is there a reason that they should book the call? Can you give something away for free? Can you push them into a free group so you actually get a higher conversion rate from the same amount of views? You get more people inside of a group and then from that group you get an ascension rate because then they have consumption with you. They get a bunch more value that they didn't get. You have higher touch point. you have personalization, you have stuff inside a group and then you can ascend them into the next layer of whatever monetization that's maybe a paid group. Now, next one is what's the offer? Because you could sell something, I don't know your niche, but there's a world out there where you have two things that you sell a month that are 50K. Like I don't know your niche and that's probably an extreme example, but like or a 10K thing that you sell 10 people on, you get to 100K a month. So like you can change how much volume you can do. You can change what you're offering like what the funnel style is. You can change what then like the whole funnel stack and then you can change what the actual offer is in monetization model. You can also make it so there's higher LTV or it's recurring or it's something that then once someone buys this they ascend up into this and turn your 10 to 20k current customers into 100k a month. So like there's so many other levers you can pull that's not just like do more videos. Um that's kind of like the simple answer is like just get more views and keep everything the same. Let's just say and assuming there's so many variables here but like assuming that. So hopefully that helped think about. Again, this is not my space. So, uh, or it kind of is, but not as well. So, hopefully that was helpful. And then also paid. Yes, I've heard that there is like a big thing where you can run paid to your organic. So, just like essentially retargeting traffic. So, like people who viewed or people who engaged with your stuff on organic and then just put like a little booster behind it and get, you know, a couple multiples on that. I've heard, but can't confirm. Uh, love the content. I binge watch all your videos. Geez, you're the reason I have watch hours. Uh, we're running a leading regional Eastern European MMA gym. Nice. We have top-notch coaches, a couple UFC fighters, and a bunch of good prospects. Cool. We're currently running a low ticket community in our country and have a great local presence. I would like to run a high ticket offer. And for this, I believe we need to target the states to make it more make it a rec for recreational people. As pro fighters typically don't have the money and high ticket coaching isn't common in our region. So, it' be more of a fitness learn fitness basics questions. Do you know of any similar offers that are working? I would like to test it with paid ads. What budget would you recommend? How would you approach this? First off, congratulations. That's amazing. Um, and thank you for watching. I appreciate the the kind words. Um, so I will say low ticket community is what you're currently running. So I assume you want to run a high ticket because when you run a high ticket offer, you have to think like there's so much more that goes into that than just like, oh, now we make more money per person because there's cost, there's management. A lot of time it's like over x amount of terms. So it's six months of coaching. It's either your time that you're doing it or now you're paying a coach to do it. you have to audit how they're doing it and like it just becomes a bigger thing when you start to do high ticket in that way versus low ticket generally is a bit more like obviously it's a volume game but it's you know can be it it's a one to many style management a lot more where you're not doing onetoone with every single person there's group aspects there's pre-recorded content it's community management it's just different so there are game there's a play where you can keep the low ticket and just go to different countries for that so like if you already have a system that works why wouldn't you be able to go to adjacent regions or US or whatever and try and see if that works first so you don't have to build out anything new. So you can test different regions, test different places keeping your exact same offer stack. You already know how to convert on, you already know how to manage the people, you already know how to do all the stuff for the current offer. So that is like less complex. Next is you can do paid within that region. I don't know if you said you do that. Um but trying to do that I don't know if you said all I think you said yeah we have great local presence, podcast, Instagram. Cool thing with that kind of stuff is it it can be multi-reional. Um, I don't know how much of your stuff is based for that specific region, but that's important to know. Um, and then next piece of that is, yeah, offer stack. So, there are other ways to make money that are more productized. So, like I said in the in one of these prior questions, but where people are saying, oh, like a mid ticket. So, you can have mid tickets that are maybe I don't know that you I don't know the fighting space well enough. Um, but where you can do how to do XYZ, that's like a course that would be you could actually sell for $500 or $300 or whatever that you could do more volume on. that's like a really good offer that has no oper that has no operational bloat because all you're doing is giving them login access to a course and like XYZ, you know, maybe a different community or support. Um, so yeah, you just have to kind of come up with the offer stack. I think maybe that would be a little bit better. Um, I don't know of any similar offers. I can try and find some. um DM me on in on uh on X and maybe I can see if I know anybody or like if I can share it in a in a good way that'll find some people that you can model off of um that are in obviously like a little bit different niches but similar um paid ads. Yeah, I mean paid ads could work. Again, I don't know what you're running local. I kind of need some more context before I just like give a bunch of of my opinions, frankly. Um what budget would you recommend? 50 bucks a day. Uh how do you approach this? You need a proper funnel that actually converts uh paid traffic. I don't know if you're doing everything with organic. So yeah, I would do that. I would start with just trying to see if you can take your current system and just doing it in other regions. Um, if you for whatever reason can't, maybe try and test high ticket. I know you said it doesn't work in your region, but maybe there's a mid or high ticket you can do there. And then yeah, you can always sell to any country. You can sell to the US, you can sell the UK, you can sell to Australia, you can sell to any of these um with any offer as long as it's a good enough offer that you know, classic, but people feel stupid saying no to. So yeah, hit me on X. I want to help, but I don't know how as much. Um, I was wondering if you could share some average KPIs across the industry. I understand it can be particular on the funnel type offer. Yes, it can. But what are the minimums? Oh, banan or benchmarks you've seen for cost per call, cost per click, video playthrough rates, call funnel, straight ad to VSSL, no opt-ins. The only optin I have for those are interested. It's below the VSSL right now. I'm seeing 13% video plays, no optin, and it feels quite low. I've made sure the messaging is targeted directly at my ITL avatar, but I have no. So, all right, you have everything's a funnel. Everything's a funnel. So you have people who are ad click just clicking in general. So and here's another thing organic versus paid far different. So I think you're saying on here ad. So you have an ad. Someone's going from the ad and they're landing on a page that's a headline, a VSSL and a button. You're saying on that video you're getting a 13% video play. Okay. Majority of the time those are not going to get consumed anywhere near as much as one that are gated with an opt-in. And because someone who's gated an opt-in already just clicks from that page, it's the classic click, you know, 20% optin in, 80% bounce off that page, but the 20% that opt in are giving their name and email to consume to get access to said free training. So they then have the intent to then watch the training versus someone who just clicks the page, sees the video, clicks play, lets it run for a little, is sitting on the bus somewhere, turns it off, goes on to do their thing, bounces off the page, they're gone forever. Okay. The people who apply direct, when that button is right there, you're going to have a much higher opt-in rate because they didn't have to consume or wait x amount of time. I'm sorry, not opt-in, apply, because they didn't have to wait for the application to show. They didn't have to consume anything. They can just apply directly. Now, costs are like significantly lower, like, you know, significantly lower than ones that can be through opt-in. And again, it completely depends. Like, back in the day, we would get $50 calls through opt-in funnels. You know, we can still get $50 calls through VSSL funnels. We or just VSSL direct funnels like you're talking about here with no opt-in. Um, you can get it really depends on like the niche and all these kind of things cuz like I know people who do thousand plus calls that are like the most qualified craziness ever, but they sell a 10K or a 50K or whatever thing and it just crushes. And you know when you're doing volume it's 200, it's 400, it's, you know, in that range, let's say, of call. Then you have qualified versus not qualified. So you could have a $250 qualified call, you could have a $700 qualified call. It's more as it's more about backing in the economics of your offer and of the rest of your math. So, if you're selling something for $7,500, you have to back into that what you can pay per call. And like I don't have a sheet out right here, but like and I don't really just want to like rip for you, but if it's simple math, let's say it's, you know, a 10k offer, what can you pay cost per per call? 10k offer. What can you pay cost per call if you have a thousand dollar calls? Okay, let's make this super simple. You have thousand calls. Of that, 50% show up. Okay, so now you have $2,000 calls, live calls. Of the $2,000 live calls, let's say 30% of them buy. Okay, so it's a $6,000 purchase. I think I just did that math right, but it's a $6,000 purchase to buy something 10K. Like, that math does not work or it should not work. Like, yeah, you're making four grand, but then you have to pay your sales rep a,000 bucks and you have to pay your fulfillment team whatever, and then your overhead and whatever. So, like you need the math to back out, but like all to say, you could have $10,000 calls if you were selling a $150,000 thing. Like, depending depending depending depending. But like all this say, it's not necessarily about what your cost per click is or what your whatever is. It's all down to what your cost per purchase ends up at depending on your different funnel type, your offer or whatever. What the cost per purchase is in relation to the truly to the LTV that you make over X amount of time. um which is that's the longer play, but what is the cash collected? What's the AOV? What's the like amount you collect? So, if your cost is $1,000 to acquire a customer and you are collecting $4,000 on cash collected and you're getting a 4x frontend rorowaz, like generally speaking, you're pretty good, right? Is like just some quick math. So, you can again send me stats on this and I can work through this with you and like actually make a sheet with what your numbers are if you want. So, just just DM me. How would you recommend learning media buying? What would you recommend for beginner? I'm doing 1500 to 2K daily off something a lot recently. So through SEO now in the process of starting to run ads. Good  I don't know enough about SEO, but that sounds fantastic. And I don't know if I'm doing things properly, dude. There's a lot of places you can start. You can just be anonymous on X and talk about this and say how you're doing this and like beat around the bush on it and then you'll start to meet people and like build in public groups or whatever and do that. Uh there's tons of YouTube stuff. Um Gabe Anel has a really good um media buying thing, but his I don't know if his for lead genen his is mainly lead gen affiliate stuff. So like he has a good group of guys that do this. They're all almost all meta. There's definitely some other traffic sources, but like he teaches meta inside there and that's what he runs. Um Google Justin Brookke has some good stuff on there, I've heard. Um I haven't been through his stuff, but I've heard and seen his stuff around for a long time. So that's a good one. Um but yeah, there's a bunch of guys in there. You just got to go on YouTube, find some guys who talk about it. they either have groups or free communities or paid courses or whatever and then just get in those. And yeah, I would I would start investing, you know, some of this into some skill sets that you want to stack. But like yeah, this is great. So nice. Oh man, I don't know if I'm going to do this one in front of you guys, but I want to ask how does a person pick a niche or industry he's in and make it his life. Like how does this actually decide it right now? For example, I'm in a stage where I tried growing operating for a year. It worked. I did pretty well. I even invested a high ticket mentorship. It didn't work out. Just wasn't a fan of the model back end. And I'm just gonna I don't know. I'm just going to read this really quick. Sorry, guys. All right. All right. So, here we go. So, how that brings me back to the main question. How does someone pick a niche or industry that becomes their life? Or maybe you don't. Maybe just try a bunch of things and see what sticks and turn what you do turning 20 in a couple months. All right. You're a young gun. You tried a bunch of stuff. You see all these crazy opportunities. See people just printing cash and this and this and this and this and this. Bro, just pick one. Just pick one. And it doesn't matter which one. It's whichever one you're interested in, whichever one you see the market in. Like, yes, there is benefits sometimes in market waves. for example, Tik Tok shop earlier and when it was hot and like finding those hot trends, being able to lean into them. There are people who crushed on that from the affiliate side, from the offer side that then put their products on there and like all these different ways. You need to just find one and lean into it. So, if you have the choice to do it, you're going to find somebody that you respect that has um you know, modeled everything that direction. Just watch YouTube videos, find one niche of things, whether that is branded drop ship, whether that is lead genen. You know, if you said right here, I'm negative money right now. I wouldn't do something that costs money. So, I would do something that's service- based from the start. You with service based a lot of time you can get paid to learn both on contract or if you work inside of a company. Um, you said you growth operating like you're getting your feet wet and you're seeing all these different things. So, you're like right here like I'm not sure if I'd stick with Shopify long term. So, that bring like you're just bouncing around and like you're just not going to like trust me, I did this. I did this so many times over. Like I literally have tried everything and like at some level it's like tactical because now I have like enough of like a little bit awareness of all these other things but I was never an expert at one so I never got compensated accordingly which I didn't deserve to be because I never stuck with one. So like until I stuck with info coaching so like in that world and did that. So I know guys who stuck with media buying and who do millions of dollars a month. I know guys who stuck with physical e-commerce and went from drop shipping to branded and do hundreds of million like literally hundreds of millions of dollars. I know people who do that in lead genen who do over hund00 million dollars. I know people who do like dude you can do it in any single business ever. It's just like you have to stick to one and you will learn some of these ancillary skills but like I actually saw this one down here when I was reading that. Do you ever worry that your business won't be sustainable or work over the long term? I have a fear that it's great now but what happens if 10 years down the line? It's like the same thing and same thing with this picking an industry like you just have to pick one and dude like 10 years is so long. Like yeah, of course AI is going to eat up XYZ thing, but like right now what you can do is stack your skills and become a more tactical individual and like someone who can produce income, someone who can produce results, someone who can be accountable to themselves for saying, "Oh, I'm going to stick to this and get to this get this to $250,000 a month and not jump ship when it's at 25K because this other things seem shinier with a bigger market." Like all of them have the opportunity to be large. All of them. All of them. lead genen, affiliate, SAS, agency, info coaching, like any single one of them in that little world. And then there's that's like this big of the internet. And then there's all these other things. And not to say that like you should go look at all these other things because you have enough to look at, but like literally pick one of these models and just stick to it. Kids stuck to memecoins that stuck in that and then met the friends and then created the groups then did all the stuff and whatever. They make money on info coaching through the memecoins and then they print and make 20 to 50k a day every day on public trade. There's people who just did that and because it was fun and they were hanging out with their friends after Fortnite and they just started memecoining. Like there are people who like I talked about those younger guys I know that like  crush and all they do or like the piece of them I know which again is not I I think they're amazing is like do these Instagram growth pages and all that kind of stuff. And it's like that's sick. And like they just stuck to it and now they're like the big wigs and it's like okay cool. These guys that are in ecom had two businesses that got to a couple million a month. Cool. now they're at, you know, 10 15 plus a month and they just stuck to ecom because they understood it and then they know the nuances and it's like you have to get past that whole like 8020 to become really good and become the next. You have to be the, you know, 99 one. You have to know the nuances. So like just pick one and like this is no on you because dude I did this for 10 years or seven years where I just like weasled around and just like oh what should I do about this or this or this and like didn't focus and you just got to pick one. just right here. You said you just got to stick to one thing. All these like a focus tool can be whatever and like just pick one. I'm I'm done talking about this, but like yeah and DM me. Um picking an industry kind of similar to this is just like just pick one. I mean that's actually different. So picking an industry um I have a very good example of this. So I was learning the info call game, the VSSL call funnels, the whole thing. And I partnered up with a life insurance agent uh and I was like, "Oh, I can easily do this." And I did. And I easily did do it. And we picked an industry that he was familiar with cuz that's like what you're number one supposed to do at some level. And we picked architects cuz he used to be an architect in the past and then got into life insurance. We built the entire thing around architecture. We use a little architecture language. We branded the offer company as architect. Turned this thing on. Didn't even pay on ads. We did LinkedIn outreach because it was so targeted at a specific job and industry. And he got such like, you know, $12 calls are coming in. He gets on the phone with all these people and he has so much to relate with them. He could talk to him for hours about insurance and all this whole thing. all to come back in the end. The offer he was selling them, they couldn't afford because generally speaking, according to XYZ and the people he talked to and the, you know, industry stats, if you look them up, it's like architects are not a high-paying industry. And there's like the top creme to the creme like anything, anyone can do it based on my last message. There's guys who make, you know, tens of millions of dollars as architects, I'm sure. Um, and definitely I know guys who make millions of dollars as architects. Um, but all to say the general population of who he was targeting with the one offer because he was selling a specific product, which is also a no no. Um, it's just, you know, trying to jam one product and trying to sell it to somebody versus finding an audience and building something for them like we do in info coaching a lot of the time. He was like, damn. Um, I have hundreds of these calls with these architects for damn cheap and they're qualified to the standard that I initially set, but they don't qualify for my product that I'm trying to sell and it's a low money-making opportunity. So then he moved and went into a higher income, higher, you know, whatever. Let's just say small business owners because it's easy. They have, you know, more disposable income. They have these different things. And then instantly his offer started working because it was a better offer. Same thing if you would have gone to doctors versus architecture. If you would have gone to whatever and then an example, you go to engineers and they need to think and they do all these math and all this kind of stuff. So, it's like picking an industry that you understand, picking an industry that you know, um, picking an industry that you kind of know, or picking an industry that you can learn or that you're interested in, and then building an offer that works for them of an actual problem they have, not just trying to take a product you have and jam it into an industry. So, hopefully that was helpful. Do you ever worry that your business Yeah, this one already talked about. Um, but yeah, my whole thing is like just lean in. Like a lot of the time you're not building these things to sell, so it doesn't really matter for 10 years down the line. So, it's all about the cash flow you can generate right now. And then as you learn the skill sets will stack. so high and so fast that you'll be able to see this next vision and if this just cash flow thing and then take the cash from this and go into something that's not going to be affected. The 10-year timeline is always moving. 10 years is always 10 years from now. Always. So things change tomorrow that you can access and leverage that you know could burn it in 10 years, but then you could use it inside the business that then would make it so you wouldn't because now it's inside, right? And it's no longer a threat. It's now a strength. So like yeah, what exactly is media buying? Media buying is the act of paying for ads. So that is you know a media buyer is someone who clicks the buttons inside uh meta, Google, whatever, Tik Tok and buys ads. So they usually have someone who does the creative or like either they do it or you know you need creative and you need copyrightiting media buyers going in there and doing the targeting, the optimization, the budgets, the stuff like that. There's a bunch of stuff and people go like crazy cracked on this that are like campaign structure, scaling, um testing over into scaling, like all these different things. So there's like complete gurus at this that spend literally like millions of dollars a day on ads. um that do direct response ads. I know guys, I don't know anyone who spends that much, but I know people who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a day that only do media buying and have someone who does creative, they have someone who does copy. They piece and part it all together and all they do is media buy and they're usually actually pretty good at the other two. They're really good at um copywriting mainly um and math and stuff. So, improving messaging on ads and VSSL to get higher quality prospects to increase our prices. Improving messaging on our ads in VSSL to get higher quality prospects. Okay. To increase our prices. Interesting. Uh, as you're improving messaging, we know that the cost per booked call will increase. What other things should we optimize for? Be aware as this test occurs. Um, as you improve messaging, I don't know that your cost per call will increase. So, like an example of this is like if you niche down, sometimes yes, but sometimes no. So, if you're like, oh, uh, I'm specifically going to talk to 25 to 50y old males. And then you target 25 to 50y old males. and you call out 25 to 50 year old males and then you like tool your messaging around 25 to 55 25 to 50 year old architects use my my last example your cost actually sometimes will go down because like you're actually landing in the pocket and it like hits it you're not hitting everyone and then only the right ones are coming through that are qualified. Um so not necessarily with the messaging to increase the cost. Um sometimes if you're like oh and you have to make over $200,000 a year and whatever. Yeah, your calls will go up, but like, you know, it's pretty silly for someone who doesn't hit XYZ criteria if you're direct calling it out or saying like, don't apply if you're this, this, or this. Only apply if you're this, this, and this. Headline across the top is only for 25 to 50 year old architects that do this, and that that make over 200 grand a year. Like, as long as you can try and like filter them out as much as possible, that sometimes of course will increase the cost per um but your quality is in alignment with that. So, you just have to make sure that your math backs out. So, back to like the one I talked about up here somewhere. Um, up here, you need to make sure that your math maths. So, you have to be set selling something that you can get two, three, 4x or whatever on the average uh in cash collected versus your cost per sale. Um, and that's just like some rough numbers. So, I know people who run at 1x but have a big backend on their thing. You just need to know your numbers so to make sure that the math works when you have a higher cost uh per book call. Um, but yeah, if you have people that are in pocket that the quality is good for, that they show up for the calls better because the framing is all around it. Like if you have congruency and continuity throughout your entire funnel from A to Z, you have like a higher throughput. So more people show, more people close, assuming that everything continues to be in alignment, the offer is good, all that kind of stuff. Um, so yeah, so as you improve messaging, just make sure that carries throughout the entire funnel. Um, make sure that you know your numbers and your math and that you track what you had before and then what you have now. So if your cost per call goes up, your cost per call goes down. if your show rate goes up, if it goes down, messaging on your show rate is in alignment, the messaging in your emails is in alignment with this new messaging, like all that kind of stuff. Um, just make sure you have like a real system. So, yeah, hopefully that was helpful. Um, these were good. So, thank you guys. I appreciate these. If you guys have any other ones, uh, I do these every week. Next week I'm at a bachelor party, so I'm going to see how this is going to go trying to do these. Um, but I don't party, so it'll just be a bachelor. So, um, www.ryclug.comrequest. You can submit some more of these. I also just made a new one. If you are in info coaching, oops. Oh no. If you're in info coaching, gosh, I cannot type right now. You can go to this and fill out this survey. I'm trying to gather some data on where people are at that follow me that where they're at with cash collected, where they're at with current constraints, what kind of offers they run, all that. So, this would be super helpful if you guys want to fill that out. Just trying to gather some info. You I I have contact info on the end if you want me to reach out or if um you have any interest in that. If not, you can just not put your info and that's fine. um or your contact info. Um but I'm still trying to gather the data. So, daily updates. Today's day, I think 102 in a row of doing these. Uh we're on pace for around three million this month. We've had some bumps, which is not great, but I'll get into that more on the end of month review. Got some really good um interviews. Uh people coming on this week. Um but yeah, I'm out of pocket on like half the week. So, I'm going to try to make sure I'm dialed and that I can get some of these out. Might have to double record on some days so they're live. Might have to just rip them from the car. So, we'll see how it goes. But appreciate you guys. I was going to stop at 100, but I'm going to keep going. I'm working on something big, which I'm very excited about, and I will announce on here once it's ready. And until then, I think I'm probably going to rock daily videos, then probably go to like one to three a week once some like really, really big bangers. Um, that will be super helpful, both guests as well as like some big true good uh updates around systems and things. We're running like six or seven funnels right now. I can do a full updated review on that. We have some big people changes that are happening, complete new structure. Like, it's just always evolution. So, just trying to make it to get to that 100 million a year biz in info coaching, then hit exit velocity. All right, so I appreciate you guys. 52 minutes in. Ryan.com/doc. You can see all the past videos, um, interviews, stuff like that. So, I will talk to you guys soon. Comment on this. Comment on this one. 50 if you made it to the end. 52. Comment 52 if you made it to the end. Um, and then, yeah, hit me up on IG or X. I appreciate you guys. Right.
