# I'm Done Making Daily Videos... Here's What’s Next | EP120
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wVIDB9WpFY

What's up, guys? Today's video is going to be a little different as I'm going to be sharing why I am done making daily YouTube videos. I've been going for 120 days straight, four months in a row. So, we're going to talk about why I did this in the first place, what some of my initial goals were and expectations, some of the insane results and things that have come from making these daily videos, why I'm making the shift to stop making daily videos, and what phase two looks like, which I'm extremely excited about. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done over 78. It's actually 79 almost 80 million total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale this business to over 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people building cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. I'm done with the dailies. It has been four months and it is time. My initial goals, I bought Eman's thing for whatever it was 1825 something like that,000. um which I now he has now rebranded over uh to consulting.com and it was really just kicking the ass for me to make videos. So I got on with him, we talked about it and he said, "Hey, if you can get to 3,000 on X and YouTube, you can run this, you know, side thing and basically achieve what you want." Which for me was I wanted friends in the space. I wanted to be known at some level in the space. I really wanted access to really good talent. That's a big thing that they have with their following and other opportunities, right? And these all kind of like feed into each other. And I had just been working in a cave for whatever it was, eight years or something like that. uh and really didn't network with many people. I knew a couple people in lead genen space. I knew a couple people in info coaching kind of and like internet marketing space but not really uh beyond like our actual company and the people we had worked with. So didn't really have a brand, didn't really know many people directly. I knew of everyone but like and watched everyone's content but no one knew of me. So I said, "Okay, cool. I'll do three videos a week." And then after I did like two or three videos in a row, I just got on the cadence and said, "I'm not going to stop." So 128 days in a row. Now, what the results of that and I I couldn't even like list them, but so the statistics on here 8,000 on X, 7,700 on YouTube. So, if you look at YouTube chart, it's literally just up and to the right. So, pretty steady state. So, here, this is when uh Byron Media on X, I had been he had been asking me questions. We've been going back and forth on Instagram. I had like 300 followers on here or subscribers or whatever. I was like 35 days in a row uh in. he uh shared my thing went up you know 2500 on X like overnight literally overnight and same on YouTube and then from there it's just been steady state this is when I started to do the interviews they got a nice little kick up there and it's literally just steady state up to the right so everyone's like oh why would you stop or this I have become and I'll kind of get into the why here but like a cog in the wheel and of the machine and it's time to zoom out a little bit so more results on this though 120 videos are there two have been taken down from the matrix which whatever can get into that another time, but uh one connect away at this point from everybody uh in our world. In our world for sure. So it's like if I'm like, "Oh, I want to talk to so and so. I have five people that DM me and they say, oh, I have their WhatsApp or oh, I can connect you over here. Oh, what about this?" Um talent, we post for sales. We post for marketing tech. We post for this or this or this. And like people know who we are at some level now. Obviously not. We're not none of this is like huge, right? 7,700 on YouTube, 8,000. This is not huge in comparison to like virality, but my goal was never virality on purpose. Uh it was to stay in pocket. Like the people I get to talk to and have, you know, that are friends or known in the space that I get to communicate with are the 100k a month, the 500k a month, the two, the five, the whatever million a month in info coaching land. Some lead genen guys, some ecom guys, like all just kind of like that honeypot pocket. Uh and on purpose, I didn't ever full production these to make it so they would like go viral. Like I wanted them to like go like mini viral within our world, but that's it. Like I just wanted them to stay in pocket there. And at some level I feel like I achieved that. I don't really know how big the market is necessarily. Um 15,000 maybe 20,000 maybe. Um like of course there's people who don't still know like who I am in this world, but like I definitely made a dent uh in what my goal was. So my initial goal was 3,000 and basically you know two 3xed it. Feeling good about that. talent like I said is there and opportunities are flowing. So a lot of people in that land. I also like I said like 10 15,000 these other guys that kind of are in this world but then have other people one they sell something and two they also a little bit cater to the beginner market a little bit at least or at least like the 0 to 20k guys. Um and that's not really my speed at all. And again I'm not selling anything really have interest in that. Um so I think a portion of that following comes from that for a lot of these people and that's not my target. So my target is higher level opportunity one two 5% tweaks to someone who's doing a couple hundred grand a month or a couple million a month and it's a bigger dent. Um so that was kind of like my entire goal. Now why and phase two. So my goal of phase two and then kind of why about this is I like X. It's easy for me. It's quick. It's like what I really want to do like globally here is like I just want to continue to build big things. I want to continue to like skill stack and grow and like our thing is not that big right now. Like I'll be the first to say it like we're doing 3 million a month. We're, you know, we're at, I don't know, 1.6 or something month to date. It's the 10th. So, like, we're on pace for crushing it, uh, in comparison to our past goals. But, like, again, we're friends with guys who do 12 million and 15 million and 20 million and there's that's just our little internet world. So, like I just want to actually build and actually like go back to being focused on that. So, my goal is to continue to X steady because I enjoy it. I can network with people. It's fun. We can go back and forth. It's very easy to just pop it open and do it. YouTube, I still have cadence. Like, I still have I have Ravi coming on next week. Uh, Luca got bumped to next week. I have a couple other people that are in the pipe that I'm talking to. I'm going to Jeremy Haynes's event this weekend and we're going to like record in person. I've never done in person. Like all these things. So, I I don't even want to say that it's like, oh, it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or it's these days or these days. Uh, I want to continue on with sporadic on purpose. Again, I don't want this cadence of like, oh, this following for a specific thing. I just want to be able to put out good value when I put out good value. This may change. It may become machined again, but for now, that's the goal. I want to do cool interviews with people when there's an opportunity. I get connected with so many people now in these group chats. I'm like losing track. Um and again that's me like not being able to. I did a video yesterday talking about my Q3. I'm like probably need an executive assistant, probably need some of these things that I've just never had because like I'm losing structure on that. Um the businesses are getting more machined and in a good direction. Um which is kind of like my existence. So like I kind of just view it as that. But when I layered this into my life, it's like crazy how much overtime it took across messaging and over here and making these and simple but just like making the boards. So, um, so yeah, I want to continue to do interviews and I will continue to do big solo videos for sure because I like have fun doing those. So, if you know we do 5 million this month, let's say it's like, "Oh, cool. We did 5 million this month. Here's the breakdown. Here are the new funnels we're launching. Here's some cool things we tweaked and learned and found." Like, I like those. But I think at this point the quality will go up from doing those versus just forcing a video in a day on like what's hot on my mind, what's hot of my mind or like who can I jam it as an interview or like what about this and kind of get back to just focus on making good ones when I do make them and doing them sporadically, right? So that's kind of the goal. Now what phase two really is is I'm cooking I'm I'm working on something. So there's something cool I have been talking about doing it solo. I've been talking about doing it in partnership. It is large. It is good. I am excited about it, but it is not fully fleshed and I'm not going to like hard launch in any direction like right now. So, uh my goal here is to work on the machine more so as right now I feel like I am a cog within the machine. I'm a co I'm a we like I'm inside it and I'm just like the person who has to just make a video a day and do all this stuff and like post about it and do this and this and like that's just not me. Um I can be the machine for sure but like every once in a while I need to like I like solving things. I like creating new builds and solving in that way. But like as soon as it's like monotonous and maintenance, maintenance, maintenance mode, it just is like not my speed. So I want to be able to work on that. Now my focus then shifting back where I get this 1 hour, 2 hour, 5 hour depending on the day back. Putting it full-fledged into main code. We have some crazy things we're talking about doing that I think will be very large and will be big for what our goals are there. and just like it's just the easiest or the highest leverage is probably a better way to say it place in my current existence that I can lean into and get reap a lot of rewards um both in dollars both in you know skill stacking in goal achievement all those so leaning in there phase two info coaching upstream this is what I'm cooking on I want to stay within this lane I've made a lot of videos about how focus if I like bounce over to ecom physical or if I go over like software or real estate or whatever I think it'll lose some focus on what I want to do with main co. So, I just want to stay within info coaching. I think a lot of people leave early and go try to be private equity people or go try and do software or whatever and some of them crush it and most of them don't. And like I just it's such a high cash flow game. It's such like a game I understand know like I've already put in a lot of hours into it so why wouldn't I continue to lean into it and kind of leverage the network and connects and everything I have. So, I'm going upstream in that. So, this is TBA to be announced. Um, and then personal. So, what I mean by personal is really just relationships and like physical and all that. Uh, I talked about the Q3 goals on there, but um, yeah, got some great people in my life. Got some great opportunities in my personal world that are kind of work and then some that are just personal like health and pieces around there. But, I think it's time to work on me and work on me as the machine more so than just like pumping things out every day. Like just video video, do this, do this, do this. 92 meetings a day, six interviews, four video, like just boom, boom, boom. all of those back to back to back while trying to travel, while trying to do this. Um, so I'm going to zoom out a little bit and just realize like let's be real, I'm not a content creator. Like never have been. Um, I literally like I can't even believe that I've gone 120 days. Like it feels like it's like an eight. So maybe next week I have six videos. Maybe next week I have two videos. I don't know. I or none. I don't even know. So I have all the stuff coming up this weekend which I'm excited about. I'm speaking at Jeremy Haynes's inner circle event. This is big. This is big for me. So there's something crazy cool happening here. And then this is like crushing right now. We've done like a million in the last like four days. So, we did like 3:30 yesterday and some other stuff. So, we are growing there, which is again, I don't know if you watched the other videos, but this is like renewal specials and new and this. So, I don't know we're going to flush out for the month, but hopefully it's a big one. And I again, I want to continue doing like big solo videos so I can keep up to date. And again, I think this feeds back to continuing to be known in the space capacity and and constantly get good talent. So, we have really really good talent right now. So, I don't even know like I put a no new hire rule in right now because we have so many people. I'm like, we just need to lean into what we have and grow with the current team stack uh until the rev per employee gets up to XYZ. So, that's the target right now. Blah blah blah. Kind of a shorter video, but yeah, I mean, it's been a steady growth. I tried to get a screenshot of all the videos and it wouldn't even let me. So, this is only up to 68, but uh I did make them all inside this dock right here. Um, so it's up to 119. Today will be 120. And again, two of them were removed from the Matrix or by the Matrix or whatever. Um, but yeah, so this has been fun. This has been a riot. Uh, my goal is again to just kind of continue to do them randomly X steady just because it's fun. I will make a formal fun one for this for sure. So, we'll see how this looks, but I'll do something formal here. Again, my goal is to continue to just live in my world where I'm building these, try and find good talent, try and find great opportunities, network with really cool people when I go to different places, be able to do that and digitally share what didn't work for us, what did work for us, and what we are actively trying and building. This how I've like learned and iterated everything, and I'm just going to continue to live this mantra. And again, I'm not selling anything, nor have I tried to. So, that's that. I appreciate you guys. shorter video today as a sendoff, but that's that. Instagram for chat X also kind of for chat. It's a little bit harder to navigate in there. And I will talk to you guys soon.
