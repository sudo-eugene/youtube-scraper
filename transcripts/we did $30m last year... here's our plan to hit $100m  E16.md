in this video I'm going to share our plan to scale our info and coaching business to over $100 million a year I'm going to show you exactly what we did to get to 100K a month a million a month 3 million a month where we're currently at and what we are doing to scale last year we did over 30 million in cash collected and this entire channel is just me sharing what we tried what did work what did not work and what we are actively running all with the goal of attracting a top talent Network and opportunities all right so subscribe below follow me on Instagram and let's get into it so first things first we got to 100K through low tickets which is kind of crazy cuz nowadays in this environment marketing environment um low ticket is more mass and I think even then it was cuz it didn't really work for us but we had just cusp like 100 to 120k a month um basically break even doing low ticket so this is all for Fitness so we were selling a low ticket $27 a month uh recurring access to like a fitness app so meals uh workouts all of that kind of stuff and then also at the same time we were building out an info product that I believe at the time we were selling for like $4.97 that we were not actively running ads to but we tried the auto webinar in vssl but this was the main all right so we had however many thousands of subscribers onto this all paying 27 a month with a low ticket uh uh Oto or I'm sorry a low ticket funnel with an OT for Lifetime access for like $147 so at that time we then moved over to let's do all call funnel so we completely shut this down and moved everything into a vssl call funnel um that we built out in like a weekend at least V1 obviously um and started running at I believe $497 to 9.97 at the time over the phone which is again kind of crazy at the time but that is how we scaled to a million a month so we were selling an info product so login access group coaching and uh community and at $9.97 to $4.97 price when we got up to a million so we did that for many many months um on end and that's how we hit our first million dollar month and it was all through One Singular funnel all right so as we continue to scale we moved it over from instead using that exact same funnel we used for high ticket coaching instead so this entire time we're optimizing the funnel but we're technically still using one funnel all right so we scaled up to 3 million and actually 3.8 was the peak month where we were doing we're now selling High ticket coaching on the back end so instead of it selling info which has great profit margin but no way less LTV at least how we were doing it because there was no Ascension rate they cannibalized each other because they were very similar one was like a do-it-yourself um basically fully or kind of a done with you with the group coaching but but super intensive video courses and access to information so we just completely toggled over and decided to sell coaching specific so now and this is what we actively currently sell uh it is an annual subscription coaching that is 7K plus let's call it so high ticket um and all done through that exact same funnel right now as we scaled still running that same one so the same Pieces come down but acquisition costs have just more and more gotten crazier and they've just gotten much much higher than than where they initially were and the big difference between these two is the Fulfillment cost so like if you're looking at it as the whole company the info has very very little cost to a fill right you're just sending them login access and then whatever it costs to run the community and the group coaching uh which is so nominal in comparison to having one: one coaching so hormos has a good video where he talks about this but he says basically under 20% is what your service should cost um or the delivery of the service should cost so if you're charging $100 a month it should cost you under $20 to perform set service um so our model does fit in in alignment with that but when you do info it's like 1% or like sub percent um so as we scaled there was now increase of filament cost growing team a lot of pain points all at the same time the acquisition is uh the acquisition cost per unit was also growing so what we're currently doing and this number is scaled down we're like 1.5 to2 uh which is not good for us because we have such a high overhead so we can call this like more or less break even um but this this channel is all about just like no I don't um I'm just willing to share whatever so we are scaled down right now uh in terms of everything in terms of uh sales team in terms of overall cash collected just everything as we are rebuilding the acquis acquisition side of the company as that's the most important for us right so sales and marketing business uh on the Forefront so for us we are still running this one and we just had a badass CMO join the team that is going to completely revamped this and he just now launched low ticket so for us initially the low ticket is is based on Ascension focused not on front and row as so we're not trying to optimize for aov with order bumps and um otos and all that kind of stuff our goal is to get them on the phone in order to fill the back end of the funnel which up until now has been our entire company we're B basically taking our entire company and moving it to the back and putting low ticket in front through Ascension so we can liquidate some and the math the unit economics back out to a better way all right so not to say we're not going to change that and that there won't be order bumps we won't try and offset as we scale to hundreds of units a day but just testing and right now we're already selling 30 50 whatever units a day and we just now implemented centers uh Setters OT as a call all that kind of stuff all right so that's where we're currently at and like this is not a great position for us just to be completely blunt um oops so how do I go further there we go um so into the future what the true goal is and how to get this thing to over 100 million and what we're currently doing and this is March of 2025 that we're planning this out multiple low ticket info so I'm going to Super Fan of focus and optimization so like I don't even want to move onto any of this until these are nailed or like either 100% running or completely off like I don't like being Half Baked on 20% in this and 40% in this like over time yes but all of them running at capacity because we don't even know where we could optimize and get 30% more on this layer or this and I look at everything like a funnel so for the low ticket uh version of this it's going to be your cost per click your front end meaning like cuz a lot of the time they're two-step so what's the front end conversion version metric so how can you split that page then to the order form how do you get a higher completion rate on the order form so you have emails on the back end you have Setters you have all that once they book or I'm sorry once they purchase they go to a booking page let's say 30% of those book how do we get that to 50% so same thing uh Setters in there email automation AI what we do raise that now they book with a Setter how many show up for that how many cancel how many turn into sets let's call it 30% how do we increase that layer and then the same thing they're on a closer calendar how do we make sure the shows for the closer calendar the close rate for the closer calendar all the math can back out to call it $1,000 CPA versus a $2,500 CPA right so all of that math is what I like to focus on on the optimizations of this and I think at scale is why it's like super important to focus on unit economics um and really just like the math so once we nail one of these the real goal and the way to truly do this as we've been hearing in the market and we know multip people who do this in the market today that do over 10 million a month that's why this is like this is a Playbook it's already been run this is nothing new no Reinventing the wheel is to then have multiple low ticket uh info direct so these kind of are like a package deal but essentially right now we were on one vssl funnel and we and we are testing one low ticket funnel and they're directly not like super aligned okay like kind of but not super so what we would do is let's say in this Fitness example we would have menopause Focus vssl so all of your ads and all of your um your Landers your vssl all of that would be menopause focus and how you're solving for something that's a menopause Focus problem unique mechanism and then pushing them to apply and phone call in the same way you would also have a menopause low ticket like menopause master class that has XYZ free gifts it's solving for this and it's specifically focused to that so having those two pairings would then allow for us to have a Setter team that's specific to menopause so they buy the low ticket that's menopause they do whatever order bumps that's menopause the call is a menopause implementation call that's with a Setter with a dedicated Setter pod that's all around menopause all right see I'm going with this and then goes to the same backend team that we're back and forth on this and again we don't have to wor even worry about this right now but likely one centralized sales team that closes for all of those so everything is in its own line here and then you have multiple of those and it comes together when people apply Andor just get booked through a set with a closer and then the closers are all selling the same product because they all do solve the same thing and they all the service delivery will be consistent as one at least in current form of plan um for the high ticket coaching but they will all roll right like right here all uh all to a core backend coaching offer and all roads lead to Rome so all these different Lanes of different traffic or I'm sorry different like pain points and offers all will come in and then they'll all liquidate out into one all right now that's the front end as you could call it of the business and just that alone like we know people in that model right now who do whatever five six million a month just on the front end the low ticket like acquisition and then do another five or six million on the back end so that right there is over 100 million just that model in that Playbook now what are other ways to do this in increase or in addition uh graduated backend coaching offer so right now we have nothing ironed out for this uh we currently have like a it's basically a th000 off what you'd pay upfront to continue and then we do twice a year we do a um like Black Friday sabur Monday then like a Christmas and July style thing where it's 5K for a renewal and we'll do like $1.5 $2 million just off that for current customers to renew that's not really a fantastic just like downsell opportunity like it works and it's a nice promo but we need something that's Evergreen so we're building a retention team we're coming up with a new offer so what's important for somebody to stay is it um the coaching side like the personalization is it the accountability is it the community and what's the pricing and then how can we align that with the cost of the coach because if they're only doing this amount of work then they only get paid this amount and then we only charge this amount like making sure that Trio is always working um that's a big one and then just other things that we can sell and then so other LTV boost supplements we've done Partnerships and tried to do this but we've never taken it fully like serious last time we paid this crazy amount for test kits and then they would recommend supplements and we paid like I don't even know how many millions of dollars and got back like 100 Grand like it just the the partnership was not an alignment um and the user experience was not that elevated that it made sense for the cost right swag we do have a swag thing but like again right now we don't sell low ticket like very very little this is more or less us right now so we're just selling High ticket coaching so that's three four 500 units a month which is like not a needle mover when you do swag and supplements like it can be I guess if you like really do a continuity play with subs and stuff like that but for us it's like let's have thousands of customers first a month and like if we do low to get right we'll have 200 500 a, new units a day and then these supplement things in these smaller recurring amounts can add up to large numbers but for us it's just hmates sunet uh swag we do have a store that has this but same thing it's like it's such needle it's such little thing and because we want quality and not this crazy cost um we basically just break even on it it's just like a brand play and then software this is like the big question mark and everyone talks about it and it's distracting and it's all these things so I'm going to leave it in this this may be distracting shiny object bucket but if this thing turns into a machine if and when this turns new machine and scales to these numbers there may be enough time and allocation where myself and other others on the team te can dedicate that to building out software that's specific to the space so there are AI plays already that I know of that would work for our specific market and essentially we could be the first client as I know of tools that we use that would be a lot better if we could customize XYZ and we already have the marketing chops to be able to do it so this is like the fairy tale question out there fugazi thing but all of these are like direct and we know the Playbook is there I mean Playbook is even there for software it's just like a completely different play that I'm not interested Ed in being distracted by until we hit these numbers and we're doing 10 million a month um so this is our current goal this is our plan um I want to just have this channel to be able to update on what we're doing in this and just to tell you so like right now we're doing this um current stats are looking good we're 60% liquidating on the front end on testing right now with no aov boost other than just like literally the One Core product cost um OT is booking out call it 50% we don't have stats on how many Setters turn into sets but was like 30 to 40% of those set calls or I'm sorry of those direct bookings with Setters turned into closer calls and then uh now we just have to see how many of those back out we did have our first one that already came through like two days in of uh set to close of like the first whatever eight or nine calls so good things uh good things to come but yeah this is a very very direct response heavy focused business when in the past it was kind of that but all in one funnel which was just silly and we know that in like in hindsight we would have done a lot of this earlier but we're here now and we can't so got up to 3 million a month did 30 million a year and cash collected scaled down um because of acquisition and we didn't want to just dig into like this red hole um and doing whatever around a million and a half 2 million right now just like getting our bearings and rebuilding all the stuff in terms of acquisition while the rest of the company still operates as is so all the coaching all the backend all fulfillment inhouse all of that's operating and we basically make no money at those numbers um and now it's how do we scale this thing back up to then go three 3 5 10 right so that's the update uh like I said hit me up on Instagram for questions comments anything like that and then subscribe on YouTube and ask any comments in the thread below I'm just going to share as we go so talk soon
