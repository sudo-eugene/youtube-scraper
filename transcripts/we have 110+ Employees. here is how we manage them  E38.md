## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taC9zoADBpU

In today's video, we're going to be talking about how we manage our remote team of over 110 employees in our info coaching business. I'm going to start by going through a quick org chart overview and then break it down by all company ops, marketing, tech, sales, CS, and product and go through the different meeting schedules we have, the data and dashboards behind them, and the channels that we use to communicate and manage. Sorry about the noise in the background. I'm traveling. So, that is what it is. Then, if you stick around to the end, it's going to be yesterday's stats, high ticket buyers, low ticket buyers, and cash collected. And a quick company update. Last year we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching biz. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing that either works or doesn't. Uh all of the goal to find talent opportunities and network with cool people doing the same. All right, then I ask you to subscribe just if you want to see more of these. Comment if you like something or if you have topic requests and like the ones you like. So let's get into it. The video is glitching. I'm sorry. I need a new laptop at 2500 subs. So marketing over here. We'll get into these kind of deeper, but marketing is going to be this section. Tech is going to be this section. Sales setters are going to be this section. People and CS and kind of some like ancillary ones that live under these are going to be here. So, let's just get straight into it. For all company, the channels that they're going to live in for everything. So, it's going to be all departments are in these is just the general, which is basically used for announcements uh and notifications of all hands, meetings, birthdays, all that kind of stuff. Uh it is locked and only used for admin purposes to post into it. Walking the walk is a super fun one. It is us doing it right. It is a fitness company and so it is us doing fitness. It is us sharing fitness. It is us living the methodology in life in nutrition, in health, in lifestyle and everything. So walk in the walk is a fun one. Client wins is that same is style thing but of win of clients, right? So they're in there sharing wins um from the coaching section uh wins that they get in CS, wins that the sales team finds, right, of uh in the communities, everything like that. And it's just like a hype up channel and just to show what we're doing works. Okay, big one there. And then the only meeting that we have that's everyone is a monthly all hands meeting that is basically we put a slide deck together and we go through it. It is the first week of the month. Um and it's about an hour long. We do wins, we do company updates, we do all that kind of stuff. Ops, this one is going to have an operations channel. So for us, ops is CEO, C chief, whatever I am officer, uh CMO, tech lead, who's basically CTO. I kind of like stand in that place, but is what it is. uh sales director, which is actually right now like our closer manager, setter manager. So you're going to have, sorry, let me clear this up. CEO, COO, CTO, CMO, uh setter manager, closer manager, CS manager, and chief of people. Okay, so that's who is currently on that meeting. The dashboard that fires into the channel every day is completely automated and the time ranges are going to be yesterday and then month-to- date, quarter to date, year-to- date of actual numbers. Then trends of where they are targeting for monthto date, quarter to date, year-to- date and then in comparison to those ranges as well. Okay. And then metrics that we track are gross rev, net rev, new rev, active rev, ad expense, refund dollars and percentage, booking count, client count, and then the cost per in comparison to the ad spend. Okay. And again, that is yesterday, month, quart. So this is just like a overarching operating dashboard that fires into there. We do go deeper in the actual ops meeting that are kind of more tangible uh or like actionable is probably a better word actionable metrics. These are all as well but like we have ones that people have to manually collect and bring into a meeting. We're a big fan of automating but we have found that we overautomated and people were not tied to numbers and connection because we didn't ask them to do that or to fill out things. So that's there. Uh weekly ops meeting uh for us is going to be about an hour. The monthly is the same team we do the monthlies with and the quarterlys with and generally those are an hour and a half to two hours. And then we have a one uh one to one. So Tuesday is the ops meeting, Thursday is going to be one to ones. And we operate those as a waterfall. So it'll start as me and CEO in the beginning just us touching base and then it'll add chief of people then it'll add CMO. like and we go in this waterfall order so that if we want to carry people through because they're not we're not a huge super fan of you know let's dive deep and like what's happening in your personal life and like oneto ones at that cadence I do believe that that is very important and like knowing people as people um but on a weekly cadence and basis it's a lot more actionable and like if something happens in a vacuum over here with marketing and then isn't shared over here like a lot of time things get construed and not shared correctly. So, we're big about communication, transparency, one of our core values. Marketing channel, we're gonna have marketing main, which is like the master. Hilarious, but like we did not have this for years and our acquisition blew up. So, maybe that's key. Um, but marketing is the master that has everything in it. We have a creative paid, we have a creative organic, and because these have different contractors or different people in them for like paid ads, for example, and the creative organic is more distribution as well as obviously creative of it, but like distribution, too. And then on the tale of organic, a lot of the time the stuff will go on the website. So, there's like uh page builders and stuff in there. If my video is glitching out, I'm sorry. I'm going to try and move this around for you because I'm in the sun. Then, uh you're going to have copyrightiting channel, which is just going to be our CMO, me, uh CEO, and our um CMO, copywriter, me, and CEO. Yeah. So, that's basically just an OG channel. That's what we used to operate out of as our marketing channel, but now we have that. And then Paige Bills is an external guy that crushes for us that's new. So we keep that dedicated because kind of like it's the fun crazy build it crazy idea channel. Okay. Dashboards same ranges for this is going to be on all the data points and that is going to go over the marketing stats. So the core ones leads apps bookings clients the cost per across for all those and then new rev and then spend. Okay, which gets us the new rorowaz which we have a target that it is red or green on all these. So, same with these. They are red or green if they're in KPI or not uh against target as well as against uh comparison metrics. Okay? So, like the trend lines are going to tell you if you're on pace for target. And the comparison is going to tell you are you beating yourself or not compared to last metrics. Now, there are certain ones like ad expense for example that is kind of like gray area. It's like do you want your ad expense to be higher or lower? It's like depends. Um do you want your cost per client to be higher or lower? Always lower generally speaking. Do you want your cost per booking? Kind of depends. I mean like you do want it lower but depending on how the funnel is and if you're running more qualified versus not like it can depend but like CPA you want that lower right so it varies. Sorry this video is probably just annoying too but dashboard two is one that is more so as a target. So, this one is going to be a 14-day rolling. And I have a video talking about how I built this, but calls on day, open spots, and booked percentage because the target booked percentage is 80. And the open spots looking out 30 days can tell you where we need to roughly estimate based on what the cost per call is where we need to roughly or how much we need to roughly spend over ranges to make sure that the calendars for the sales reps are full. It's a constant dance of doing that. Um, and then there's also technically a third-ish dashboard in here because we're ramping low ticket right now, but because forever we have just been a high ticket call funnel. Um, this has been the core dashboards forever. Okay, we have a weekly all meeting. We just had our third or so like actual one of these that is led by the CMO. He's a rockstar. This is all kind of fresh. I'm not trying to steal his jazz. Um, and again, these actually I let me go into this. This is led by chief of people and um sales director is like super hypy. So, it's really good in this. The ops is run by me. The marketing is read is run by the CMO. Um, and then ad hoc, they'll constantly just like pop on, oh, can you do this time? Can you do this time? And just jam about things in the ad account. We spend heavily on meta. We do have a Google contractor, and those are kind of like one-offs. Um, but yeah, ad hoc means beyond that. Okay, so that's where we're at. So, we just covered CMO and or I'm sorry, marketing and ops. Now, tech. Technically speaking, this is like my department. Um we have one channel it's tech admin and then technically we're in every channel. Okay so we're constantly kind of filling all this stuff. The tech admin is the main channel that we manage on. All this is about how we manage and kind of overlook not the part of where we are active in and like what part they're in but that's where we manage in and it's basic tech projects. We have all the big notifications that happen in there. If a zap turns off the this like that's where we go to come together and talk about things or what's happening. Um dashboards for that automation error rates. We track these as a percentage. We have a project board that's like basically an IDS list. So all of these technically have this is about channels, meetings and dashboards, not about how we do it, but we have IDS lists. So we operate on like a lean version of EOS. And each one of these departments will have their own IDS list of like projects where they're at updates on those on a weekly basis in those dashboards. Project board and then tech tickets submitted. We track this as a number over time of how many texts tickets submit. And then if there's things that uh continuously happen and are recurring, then we will try to automate so it does not happen or figure out what the source of it is and try to solve for it and we use this ticketing system to do so. And then weekly I have a onetoone with the senior tech lead um and we go over what's priority now, what was completed and then as of the last three weeks or so he drops a daily thing on projects he's working on because we are more we're like swamped right now. We're adding crazy automations and this and that. So prioritization is huge and so he can go into deep work while also having to sometimes put out fires when things break. Okay. So we started that a few weeks ago. It's going very very well. Sales and setters. Sales ops is going to be all of the admin and management side of things. Sales team is going to be the entire sales rep team. We technically then have a setter team one. There's like 15 other channels that are notification channels. Apps uh that haven't been people that app but didn't book within the last three minutes. That's for setters that hit. Uh we have custom booking time request forms that hit other channels. We have uh all of the apps, all the bookings, all the direct bookings, all the setter bookings, all like everything. And I don't want to go into that, but like where we operate and manage out of are of these. They have a dashboard. This is that fires into the operations is for management. management will get, and this is kind of more on like the hard stats, not the activity, because they're going to have hard stats, they're going to have activity, and then they're going to have like trends and cash numbers, right? As and I'll get into that one, but so for the dashboard for this, we're going to have bookings, we're going to have call. So bookings generated on day, we're going to have calls on day. We're going to have the booked percentage. We're going to have new clients. Sales per booking is what we track as like again on the activity tracker. You're going to see show rates, you're going to see offer rates, you're going to see live call close rates, you're gonna see all that. Sales per booking is a quick number for us as a management to be like how many bookings happened to how many closed. Okay? And we know what that metric is. We know what these numbers should be. Then if you want to dig into the numbers like why do we have a 7% sales per booking? It's like oh our offer percentage was 60%. Our live call closes that oh and our our show rate was 40%. Oh we broke an automation. Oh there's a bad something like that's we you can dig into the numbers. This is a higher view. New ROZ is going to be um that number from over here. So new rev basically divide by ad expense on day and then across ranges. I didn't put that on here but all of these all are across monthto date, quarters to date, year to date and actual ranges and then trend lines. Uh cost per client CPA uh we like to share that with them as well just so they have a gauge. Setter availability setter 2025 and sales 2025. Setter availability is used for us to gauge how much we can spend into the low ticket because that is the throttle point. So like as long as we keep net CPA in alignment as it begins to as we begin to spend on more units we need to make sure that the next step of the funnel which is the Otto book a call and I've gone into that in other videos we need to make sure that the availability is there. Okay, so that's there. Setter 2025 and sales 2025. These are the activity trackers. How many calls, how many shows, how many whatever all the way down offer rates, um, all that. I technically track all that in the CRM, but these are manual fill outs that we require through forms that autofill. This is detailed today. Apologies. Dashboard for the reps. They're going to see show rates. They're or they're actually going to have bookings in here, but I don't want to type that. It'll mess my boxes up. We're going to have bookings. We're going to have show rates. Net new rev is the key one we track. So that pulls out refunds. We do clawbacks and refunds. Points. These are natural points. So points are different on weekend and weekday. You get 1.5 on weekend for cash collected dollars. And we do that to incentivize people to work on the weekend. So we get more even amount of open spots. So ad spend does not have to be throttled. Okay. Base is going to be everyone has the same base, but we just put on a dollar there because we do everyone W2. Comms is a percentage and you are at different comms percentages based on how good and how long you've been on the team. bonus is a throttle, I'm sorry, a tier uh approach based on how many points you're at for the given pay period, which is every two weeks. And then the total pay, okay, this is what they'll see. These are dashboards that fire into the channel all the time, so everyone sees the numbers. Transparency key meetings, five dimes a week huddle for setters and sales. They both happen at the same time and then they have a dual one and then they have their own weekly sales ops where they basically come together, setter manager and closer manager, and they have better titles in that. I'm just outbound director and sales director. So they have uh they have a onetoone connect between them. Then they also have one with me and the CEO. Okay. CS frankly I am not as well verssed in their full thing. I don't sit in on their meetings because they are so good I don't need to. Right. So I am much more marketing sales tech ops that style. Uh not as much CS and product. They crush it at this already. And the chief of people operates and runs all of this department very very well. She's a rockstar. Okay. They have a channel. They talk in CS they have a dashboard and these numbers are then brought to operations meeting refunds escalations is what we call it which is like a refund request they have like an entire team and system around reverting these and making it so they don't occur again killer team killer killer CS is like in every channel helping everyone are the most like proactive sweet nice like helpful people in the world um so they have escalations group engagement they track reviews and referrals all these we track across weekly basis we watch trend lines and we have targets okay meetings I I was talking about this like again I'm not even on these but they were literally talking about they're like oh yeah we're just daily touch point we're like just on Zoom all day like they just chat when they're not in between these calls. So they have pure blocked out calls because they all take onboarding calls for the new clients. Okay so when a new client comes in they fill out an onboarding form and they book a call with a CS rep then is the pass off to the fillment. These are called different things but I'm just using like generalized names like customer fulfillment right so product VIP team they have their own dedicated channel in there these numbers are reported back so this one's kind of more difficult again they they operate this like in their own vacuum they just crush this like fulfillment team like they don't even have to worry about the other ones which is great like the different departments kind of like connect on all hands and in the general chats but like they run their stuff they run their stuff and for even says it for the 900th time we got too big. We have too many team kind of too much team because we were scaling into the people and our acquisition was climbing while we were climbing uh in cash and when acquisition broke we had already scaled up the people and like we kind of need a lot of them. We did get down a little bit but like we're built to be doing 2.5 minimum amount two whatever. We're built really to we could go to five, right? So like when we're in these low numbers we are bleeding. It is not good. We are break even or bleeding depending side tangent. Okay. Active clients, non-active clients. We have a formula for this, but who becomes a non-active client? Um, and then we have it's a tracker and a percentage thing. Uh, call tracker, message tracker, MPS and open roster. So these are all we built a custom tool that tracks and AIs all the stuff and basically takes sentiment from calls, takes call length, takes call count, compares it against booking count, compares it against client count and basically it is an analytic suite for us to be able to see the performance of a coach and then inside a coach or multiple coaches inside a team. So we have teams that are broken down of coaches because we have 65 70 coaches on any given time. And we have all these in here so we can see who is performing and what we can put them up against. And then open roster is a number similar to open spots that you have over here in marketing. That is how many open spots do we have on the team on the roster across the team. So that we know that when we start ramping marketing and sales and they start to spend into it, we need to know as a trigger when we get under 300 open spots or whatever, which is in the past like our big months were 400 and something units, 500, whatever, like when we start to get nearing that uh 300 number, we start to hire again. So we have more coaches, so we have more bandwidth. Okay. Then weekly they have a one to one uh they have one to ones, I'm sorry, I believe monthly at this point now. And then they have a weekly all hand or all coaching meeting. Okay, that was a lot. So, I hope the audio isn't too bad. I hope my video is not glitching too bad. And I hope this makes sense. And you can ask questions. You can do whatever in the chat. I hope this is helpful to what we track and what we do. Quick stats on yesterday. I think I'm gonna start stop doing this part. Let me know if I should keep doing it. like this part's kind of funky and people on X and whatever are being like weird about like oh like let me know if I need to keep doing this. I I don't need to but seven we dove automations broke and we didn't know Wednesday Friday and everything exploded and then add that to the zoom thing not good good as a percentage our low ticket buyers turning into high ticket buyers is just getting better and better we just need to get CPA and then we also need to be able to scale that so we are talking about doing AOV boosts on that so that the net CPA on a low ticket portion continues to stay in this low thing as we scale which normally speaking As you do more volume and scale, it will go up. So, we're trying to get ahead of that before we do it. 50 G's yesterday, not great. 1.5 average for the month at that rate, which is not great. So, but today's already ripping, so and it's what, 3:00. So, that's what I got. I hope this was helpful. Subscribe 2500. I'm getting a new laptop as a reward just because it's funny.
