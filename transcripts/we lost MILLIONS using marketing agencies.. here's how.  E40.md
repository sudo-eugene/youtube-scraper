In today's video, we're going to be talking about how we lost millions of dollars using marketing agencies versus building an in-house team, and how you can avoid doing the same. I'm going to go through the different agency specialties that we've hired, the different pay types we've used, the org changes that happened in our marketing department from when we were doing 30K a month all the way up to 3 million a month, and then I'm going to go through the out then approach, which I believe is the best for agencies and contractors. If you stick around to the end, I've been making these videos for 40 days in a row. Uh, every day I share what we did yesterday. Yesterday was Easter, so a bad day for us, and I'll explain why. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. All I share on this channel is what did work, didn't work, actively doing, trying to find top talent, opportunity, and network of cool people doing the same. All I ask, subscribe, comment, topic, ideas, feedback you have, like the ones you like, leave the other ones alone. All right, so let's get into it. Agency specialties. There are 92 other variations of these. I am just going to share what we have used. So, we have used media buying specific. So your meta only, your Google only, your combined, right? So someone who handles both. We have hired creative only agencies that'll just do um creative for paid. We've also done some uh agencies that have done creative for organic. But again, like not what I'm talking here. Everything I'm going to be talking here is going to be what we've actually used in the marketing side of the business. That for us is 95% paid for acquisition. Okay? And again, there are 92 other variants to this. There are people that do podcast specific. There are people that do tech specific. There are like there's a million different types. I'm just sharing what we've done. Pay types, retainers, your 10k a month and that's it. Your retainer plus spend percentage. Someone's going to charge 10% on their as a fee plus a retainer to cover their overhead. Basically retainer plus rorowaz percentage. Getting a little closer to really what as a business owner you see right as the rorowaz percentage just result based. Not how much they spend on volume but closer to what is their return. They get a percentage of what they return. Row has percentage flat. As a business owner, this one is actually kind of back and forth because as a business owner, it's like great. It's like they just get a piece of what they grow. So they're spending $10,000 and they're getting back 50,000. They get a percentage of the spread there. So on that 40k, they'll get whatever 10% 30% like there's all these different variations. People have different higher pieces. And that's also back to this agency specialty. depending on how far they lean into the bucket. There are people who will do all your scripting for VSSLs. They will do like page copy. They will change out a ton of stuff versus just doing your media buying or just creating ads for you like actual creative. Even the creative ones, do they make the scripts and do the editing and then all you're doing is the filming? Do they just do the editing? Do they just repurpose stuff? Like there's a million ways that this is cut and sliced. So, I'm just kind of giving some examples. Spend percentage. This one is extremely common. um extremely extremely common um at least that we've seen. So don't take that for grain of salt. Um 92 mixes and variations of these. Some people will do splits of these. Some will do uh all cash. Uh some will do only new cash minus like things. Some will do the liquidation amount of your low ticket. Like it is literally everything in in between. And let's get into the or changes and then I'm going to back into how all of these have worked for us. So, initially it was us, big dog Luke, me, we're going to call me CTO, we're going to call him CEO, when really we were just two people with laptops. He is very, very good at marketing, messaging, and media buying. Um, he had done stuff like this prior, just kind of like drop shippy, ecom style, as well as just some other and he's really good in sales. So, as the company has expanded, I've explained this in other videos, but he got more into a place of marketing and sales. I went tech ops systems as we scaled but we have this direct overview connection of all things marketing ops and strategy that we still do together. So back in the day we're posted up in Bali sitting there on laptops and I was making Photoshop images and he was running ads and writing copy and critiquing the images and going back in this feedback loop. And then third over here is the actual expert in brand face. They started it. I came along after the fact and met them there. Okay, in person I was already working with them before then. The next evolution of that was we had a copywriter join the team. This was very very big for us because at the time we were writing a lot of emails. Um and to this day you'll see him carry out throughout this. This is the same copywriter we've had. Luke knew him through personal connection from like when from going to school together actually back in the day. He has evolved and we like joke that he has a better brand voice or he is like a dupe of our expert. Like he can write the same way she can. And he writes two emails a day for us. He writes scripts that are still our winners for our VSSLs even though we've hired it out. I'll get into that. And um yeah, so he's a rockstar, but so he joined the team there. And then what really kind of happened next was a creative. This guy is a superstar. He was amazing. Like to the point that he was kind of asking like how to take on other clients and do other stuff while he was full with us. Um he was already doing work before us as a contractor. Came on with us as a contractor and crushed it. Like some of the top VSSL edits. He could do anything. He could edit ads. He could edit organic. He could edit VSSLs and he could do everything to the point that when where does he drop off here? I'll get to that later. But um I don't know why I put process here. This is Google. Sorry about that. So the next phase was getting Luke out of media buying. So he got out of meta and we had a meta media buyer come in. We sold the creative. We sold the copywriter. All of these ranges were scaling the info product. were somewhere around a million um is still hands-on very much so. But at this point, we have no agencies. Okay, so that's the important part here. We have no agencies throughout this. This is all either contractor, contractor, contractor-ish, but like in-house and then contractor. Okay. Now, in between these phases, I was doing the Google media buying back to the courses and all of that. uh me and the CEO met inside of consulting.com group and I have always been plugged buying courses in the communities and is where we have found people over and over and over again to join the team. That is also the goal of why I do this is because when we do want to grow into spaces and do things I want to learn and I want to be able to find talent and be able to find media buyers. It's already happening on X. It's already happening in all these places for future opportunities or this business specific. Okay. So, I bought a course and this was actually not even mainly on YouTube at the time. This was all about or I'm sorry, Google, this was all about YouTube. So, we had never cracked YouTube at the time. It was hot. It was how can you crack it for a VSSL callunnel? Doing the lead uh or optimizing in through that, which instead of it just being brand, we had it up and running. We're spending three to five grand. I was buying for it actually at the time. Um I've never bought for Facebook for this specific. I bought a lot for Facebook um but never beyond like 5k in scale. These guys are spending you know 2030 a day for the last years years and years and years uh for this and other things. So I was running media then we got this then we got a media buyer then we got a Google media buyer. These are outsourced and they were running YouTube and branded search for Google nothing cold on search. Okay next phase agencies. So, the next phase, and this is when we were at about the hard part of this is explaining how we had so many things going on at the same time. And I'm going to say this over and over again once I get into this phase is like I'm not blaming an agency for why it didn't work. I'm not blaming I'm not blaming anyone. I'm not blaming us. I'm not blaming them. I'm like I mean actually that's not true. I'm taking blame. But it just wasn't the timing was and there was a lot of momentum in a lot of ways. same way that we say that in sales like we were crushing at a specific time because of a lot of other circumstances as well as sales. But like when you start to get into kind of the thicker times it's like you the the a shines through it is much easier to see where it's falling apart and where the systems are falling apart versus where everything is just in momentum climbing at the same time or falling at the same time. Right? So at this phase I am doing page builds and tech and all of that around it. So all the tracking for all of this, all of the page builds, anything that they're launching for that. But we kind of slowed down on that because we had one main core funnel. Go to the videos on the page. I have a video that's like the three offers that we use to get to 70 million. That's an example of where you can see the funnels. But we basically were running a VSSL call funnel only at this time. So we brought in a media agency. Now, how were these guys structured? So first off, these guys were flat. Okay? So when we were bringing these guys in, these two were experienced but not in our space, which ended up being a big issue over time. So that's why we moved to this right here is because this one was uh a superstar media buyer but for lead genen more. So we're spending like three 400 grand a day just not in our industry because you don't spend that in info and coaching really. They were doing like direct lead to this was not just a kind of a great fit. I don't even know why the box is so big. um not a great fit overall and yeah just wasn't a superstar. So that's why we decided to transition out of these guys is because we weren't getting the results we wanted. Now next we got a hybrid style agency. So these guys were doing Google and meta for us and we still had our superstar creative. Now they were still doing some creative. They were still doing some scripting and these guys were more of like the overall like let me look at the whole funnel. Let me kind of change this up and that at this time these guys and I have a data sheet over here. So, don't mind me looking is when we scaled up to our biggest months, which was right here. And CPA was pretty much on lock for the first couple months as we scaled aggressively into it. And then CPA started going crazy and just started climbing, climbing, climbing. Then it dropped a month, then it was climbing, climbing. And I don't want to blame them necessarily. So, their pay structure that they had with us was a cool hybrid of like the spread between. So, it was a retainer amount monthly or it's basically an upfront retainer amount that would cover them just doing it and they're like, "If we can't get you results, like you get the money back." And then from then on, it was a percentage of like a rorowaz metric. So, like how much new rev minus how much spend and then a percentage of kind of the spread the uh spread on there, which I like, right? It's like it's result based. If they're not getting results, it's not going to work. Now, again, there are multiple things that are happening in the background to make it if that works or not. Um, including the sales team, including different pieces of the like just different pieces of the puzzle. the offer structure that we were changing. There's just a lot of different things that can affect that, but we're all in the same ship. We're all targeting rorowaz profit, all those things. Okay, so that was this phase right here. And sorry if this is kind of like all over the place. I'm trying to piece and part this together in my brain uh while I actively do this. I flew back and took a red eye and I'm trying to rip this video for you guys. So, next phase from there, it was not working over time. We actually got rid of them. We brought back these guys for a brief minute. Then that was kind of weird. Then we consulted with this guy and we were kind of in dire situation. It's not backing out, but we can kind of run it on our own, but we don't want to be running it. And that's where it kind of came down to like we don't want to spend the time and the energy and like the detail orientation to do it. Um, specifically CEO who was the media buyer in and out of there. So, we were like, "All right, let's find someone else." We think the issue is we're just ramming all this spend through like a couple ads. We don't have steady mass like creative production and this is in kind of the era of everyone being like oh it's all creative it's all creative which again it is a lot of the way I mean it is all creative but this was like mass ecom style like crazy split testing of ads and we jumped to this model so we hired these guys and we're like oh cool hands off they run everything so I wrote creative here but this is like that example of the mix or the both they were running Google Facebook within Google YouTube. Um, and then yeah, so like all meta and then YouTube cold and then all of our Google as well and they were doing crazy things and like again this is no on them because they crush it and they have huge clients and they like do really well and a lot of them are in ecom. Some were in info but again they had different acquisition models than us at the time. Not just VSSL funnels. They were running low uh they were running um low ticket ascension. They were running um webinar style. They were just running a bunch of different models that at the time, and this is where it's like our problem and our fault, we pass it off to these guys and then we're like, "Oh, cool. Now to scale it, not like, oh, how can we then work on the back end and create different offers for them to media buy and do creative for that will back out better in an economics way." And that was 100% on us. They had mentioned it a couple times. I tried to launch a low ticket all myself, which is crazy behavior because I don't do that kind of stuff. I built one. We tested it. Someone else ran it in a separate ad account. We looked at it 10 days later, didn't look good. Turned it off. A month and a half, came a month and a half later, came back to it. It had backed out like six units and was like crazy profitable. Tried to turn it back on. Like just not it was this was a very messy period for us. And this is around when we started to tank down from when we were at 3 point whatever a month, 3.7 a month. Um we just started just like throttling down to like 2.2, 2, 1.5, 1.7, whatever the range was. Then we had some stuff throughout fall through Q4, 2024. And then we got rid of these guys at the end of Q4, I believe, almost end of Q4. Then at that time is when we built out this new structure of what we're currently operating on that I believe is going to be the next phase and stage of this. But basically 30k a monthish, 500ish to a million and then one to 3.5 millionish in these ranges, but CPA was sliding like crazy. So when I talk about how the margin just got attacked and eaten and eaten up, that was because of all of this. It was because of agency. It was because of model. It was because it w we just didn't have a handle on it. And it was like 100% on us. And again, great agencies. They clearly like run and have great results for people. It was just a combination of us and the timing. Now, one thing I do want to touch on, this was a percentage of spend and that's it. And I don't know why we agreed to it and we did. It had nothing to do with rorowaz whatsoever. So, at that time, we were ramping like hard. Like we were spending a million bucks a month like easy and paying like I think it was like 12% 13 like we were paying 130 G's to have media buyers and creative a month while losing money or while the CPA was climbing. So it's like we are burning money on acquisition. We're burning money on agency and everywhere else you can imagine all like just trying to figure this out. We're hiring people and this is just marketing. It's like imagine what we're doing on this other side. Like it was real pain like real growth pains. Um and that all happened around here. So, here's our new model. We didn't have the CMO in here yet. So, uh this is kind of like a multi-phase thing. We got a creative director to come in because we're like, we need creative. That's the number one thing. Uh came in to do paid. Now, basically handles organic and paid. Um they have an editor under them. Um these she's a rock star. Um and she came over from like a really really reputable place. Uh which is great. And she was working direct with CEO. He was still doing media buying. Then we brought in a media buyer and his like junior that's with him. Uh these are contractors. These are employees contractor uh contractor contractor side gig. So Google siko that we had come in media buyer and junior media buyer these are both like really really well-known people in the info and coaching space and they run a lot of other stuff. So there's a lot of similarities in VSSL funnels and ascension and all that. These are very well-known people. These guys do retainer that kind of like climb a little bit. um copywriter fixed creative director salary in with clims editor uh is like a output amount basically and then page builder this guy is a sicko I love him he's hilarious uh and he's a contractor and he runs all of our uh or he runs a ton of other people in info coaching space like every name you've heard of uh he has built a funnel for them at one point and it's beautiful and he is doing all those things for us uh and then we just brought on the CMO to actually run this ship basically saying we did this in the past we broke it we need somebody who can actually lead this department and team. We are so much direct response. We are so heavy in all this stuff. It is such a pivotal portion of the company in terms of profit growth stinging things like stable and that is now our current team. So he overlooks all of these. We work with him in tandem. I'm over here still. I don't have to do the actual page builds anymore, but I still do all the tech connections and automations, the application splits, the tracking. Like I still build all those out. Um because my tech team focuses on more backend automation, connection, sales stuff, and I still do almost all the marketing tech. I want to get out of that, but that is the structure. Okay, so quick recap. That was the app and a half. How can I quick recap this for you? Retainer versus ROAZ. There is a spread where it can be made. As an example, if we had a copywriter that's a retainer, if you there there's technically a point where like you are making so much back from them in ROI that a retainer does make more sense for you. But a lot of the time the retainers are higher and rorowaz is more guaranteed like you have to they have to make you money for you to make money like performance model. Um so I do like these more. But now let's get into big dog horos. I'm going to butcher this. Go watch his stuff. It's 500 times better than me. He has 500 times more experience and has 500 probably more than 500 times more money. Um, but his idea around contractors and how to approach this is basically hire the pros that are contract or I'm sorry that are agencies or contractors, hire the pros, prove the model, the ROI, the KPI on whatever thing you're doing. So if it's podcasting, if it's YouTube, if it's Facebook, if it's whatever, hire them out. Then you're paying them 30 grand a month or something. At the same time, you're learning from them. You're seeing how they do it. You're asking them to show you show them how show you how they do it. You're and then building an in-house team in tandem and asking them basically to consult and building your in-house team up until they can beat them or operate at the same level at them because now you have more control. They're in-house. They likely can be better and more suited to you. And the thing with agencies is, you know, they are at some level spread thin because they have other clients. Um so yeah, there's a ton of really really good agencies out there. Um you can message me. I have some really good ones I'm friends with that do a mix of all these. Um, and then there's a couple guys that are like growth marketers that are also agencies um that really really crush it. So, this is not a on marketing agencies. This is a our structure story and how we did it and how we literally lost millions in cash paid out uh that was not directly returned from the efforts as well as oh my god tens of millions in opportunity cost of us tanking down into these trenches where we're at. And that was because of the marketing agencies. Not really. It was because of how we had the model plus the marketing agency plus the cap structure, how we or the the pay structure of how we paid them and all the mix of that. So that's that. That's the overview. Yesterday's stats. It was Easter. What did I tell you? I told you the day before we did 84,000 and then it wasn't good because then we're going to do 10 or 20 G's and it was going to just average out. It was Easter, which I understand and respect and happy holidays or happy Easter to anyone who celebrates. But three high ticket buyers, 45 low ticket, which was only 20 G's. Not good. But as expected, that's the thing with call funnels when you can only accept money over the phone. Uh like at scale, no one works on those days either on the employee side and no one wants to book a call on those days. So you have low days and you need to account for that in your averages across the month. So that's that 45 low ticket. These are backing out really, really well. I have some fun updates and today is off to the races. Hopefully I have an exciting video for you tomorrow, but I am back in my dungeon and I will be sitting here and until I hit 2500 subscribers so I can buy a new laptop. So ryanclog.com, you have to use the www because I broke something on ClickFunnels and I don't care to fix it for all these videos. I broke them down into tech, ops, marketing, like sales, the different things, and then gave you the main idea because I have someone in there doing title changes and thumbnails. But check them out. You guys rock. I appreciate all the support you guys are giving me on these. It actually does mean a lot. I thought 10 people were going to watch and like 300 are watching, which is huge. So, let me know if you guys have any questions or some topic requests. Um, they're on that dock, right on the uh right on top of that dock. So talk soon.
