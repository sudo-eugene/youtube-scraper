What's up, guys? In today's video, we have a banger. We have William Brown coming from Bali. So, we're on a 12 uh 12 hour time zone difference. Got 4 a.m. and 4 pm over here. William, kick it off. Everyone knows who you are, but let's hear the intro. Yeah, for sure, man. I mean, people know me best for uh the last e-learning company that I grew from 0 to 16.4 mill over five years and then sold last year to High View, a private equity firm in America. But I've really been doing entrepreneurial stuff since I was super young. You know, when I was skateboarding, I decided to film and edit videos and try and sell them to my friends. When I was doing graffiti, I started a graffiti magazine. Uh when I got into music, I started making my own records and then got signed to a decent label and that was my first ever proper career. I DJed in over 45 countries all over the world. Learned a lot from that that I carried into business. Then I started uh trading financial markets to make more money. That turned into the e-learning company. And yeah, when I when I exited that company, my plan was just to have a one person business, you know, I didn't want to have a team. I didn't want to run paid ads. That almost killed me in in the last business. To to me, it was just so [ __ ] stressful, man. The ads, the team. And when I was lucky enough to exit, honestly, my plan was just make a few YouTube videos, get a few one-to-one coaching clients, and and just chill. The YouTube channel grew really, really, really fast, right? Right off the bat. And uh all of a sudden, I've got another [ __ ] consulting company now. And it takes us to where we are today. Yeah, absolutely. It's so funny because I I didn't know who you were prior and I was probably one of those I definitely was one of those people who was served that like initial video those first couple that you just uploaded that were just raw just like unfiltered. I hadn't heard of your stuff before and I was like oh interesting like you give to me and you know the OGs or OGs of our era remember the oven stuff and like you just give that that thought process that vibe and you know he crushed he crushed. So I want to deep dive this. So usually these are pretty tactical. We've got, you know, mid6 figure guys, seven figure a month guys, uh, are kind of like the main pocket and then of course you're going to have your beginners that are going to come through here. So, let's break into the company because and I want to give some context and pick your brain selfishly, but like what was the what was the actual monetization models? What was the whole what was the whole last business that you just sold? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was 95% paid ads driven. So, we had a tiny bit of organic, but it was for the most part it was faceless. It it was it was really pretty much just paid ads driven, massive sales team. When I sold the company, it was a team of nine closers, three setters, sales team manager, three coaches, and a support guy and a bookkeeper and and blah blah blah. And it's funny, the month that we signed the LOI was actually our biggest ever month. We did an offer we did at 824K and that helped with the sale price a bit because they actually captured that month in the the the price when they calculated the the ebidar. So that was a nice kind of cherry on top. But it was pretty simple. We were just running paid ads uh only YouTube ads into a VSSL booking calls, closing calls. We had one front-end offer which was 6.8K. We had a software but it was making very little. We had a mastermind which was making very little and it was one of those businesses where it's just banging the front end, you know, and it worked pretty well. Yeah. Interesting. And then what was the actual content? You said it was like financial market trading stuff or it was consulting or Yeah, it it was it was a a trading education coaching program. Very, very simple. Two coaching calls a week and a and a course basically. Interesting. Yeah. And all with all with YouTube ads. Only YouTube ads. Yeah. We we tested Facebook ads and they were profitable but nowhere near what what we were doing on YouTube. So we were like let's just go as hard as we can on YouTube. Yeah. And then the 15 mil in rev that was that year that was like in total cash collected and then sold for the Yeah. That that was the total across the five years and then we exited for 2.6x uh evida. Nice. Okay. Yeah. You're one of like the only people, right? I mean you probably know the list better than I do but it's what Hormosi which was licensing but info coaching. it's you. And then I've heard there's a couple others that are in like the low eight figure range, but I I don't know. They're like pretty quiet. Jeremy Haynes talks about them a couple times where he's like, "Oh yeah, you know, we've had clients who do it." And that's I don't want to say the only spaces he works in, but kind of like closer to that. But super interesting that you're one of the, you know, the ones I can count on a hand who've actually done it. It's weird, man. Yeah, there's there's more people that have done it that maybe often you just don't hear about. I heard of one from a friend the other day and I was like, "Wow, I've never even heard of that company or or the exit." So, they're out there, but honestly, I just think that there's a belief in this industry that you can't sell these businesses when Yeah, you absolutely can. You you absolutely can. You know, it's just a case of belief, knowing the process, working with a good maybe M&A adviser, and just knowing what to do really. So, yeah, 100%. Yeah, I have this like I I talk on here. I'm like, you know, 0.001% 01% are going to actually sell in the info coaching space and you know Iman all these guys they all talk about and just hammer it how it's just like never going to happen and then my my thought is of the people that actually try to build for that and actually and actually try and go for it I bet the hit rate's a lot higher than 0.01% 01% right it's in you know s high single maybe double digits of the hundred people that have actually tried to do it there's a handful right which is like much higher hit rate and I I can take that percentage but the 01% is difficult yeah well well dude I I feel like I was very lucky right because I was in I was in a financial literacy mastermind like way back in I think it's 2020 with a guy called Dan Bradbury and the first day of that mastermind we were having lunch and Dan said to me, when do you think you'll sell your business? And he was like fully serious. And I said to him, "Oh, I can't sell this business. It's like a a course coaching business. It's named after me. You can't sell them." And he was like, "Well, yes, you can. The only difference is the buyer and the price. And if you know how to do it and you do it well, you'll sell faster and easier to a better buyer for a better price. And if you don't really know how or you don't do it well, you'll sell to a worse buyer and it'll be harder for a lower price." And to hear that way back in 2020, I think it was, it just planted the seed in my head. I was like, Dan says I can sell this business. He'd sold six, seven, eight other companies, so I I trust him and believe him. And when it came to the end of 2022 when I decided that I wanted to sell, I just went back to Dan and said, "Dude, please can you mentor me through the the exit?" And uh yeah, so maybe I was lucky to have that belief implanted in my head so early, you know? Yeah, 100%. Yeah, I'm super curious on like the actual detail or like what you had to do to set that up because we hear all the things and you watch a hormosi or you know even some of these like I'm in all the groups that are the buy biz sell the online this that and majority of them are not info coaching education um but the things you hear right are like it's so funny though that right you sold anyway and it's like the lean team you had the one traffic source the right you hear all this list of things that you need you know diversification on acquisition both the s the traffic source and the models, right? So like different front-end models, you need no brand face risk. You said it was faceless, right? So that's interesting. The fulfillment needs to, right? Which is crazy. Like that's amazing that you are, you know, kind of edge case where you didn't check all the boxes based on like the quick things I've heard that you hear are like required. Um, but yeah, so I want to give you some context a little bit and then I I want to hear your take on this. So we're at 130 team right now. We did 30 mil last year in cash collected, 75 now in total. Before that we were doing 101 12 million a year and we were selling an info product that was over the phone. So like lifetime access to Kajjabi, you know, the classic basically the ovens model, the group coaching through calls and we were selling that but it was lifetime access. So no MR, no like future state and we didn't really have a backend like that was kind of like you said the volume game but it was very it was like you know a,000 2,000 bucks in that range. So it was a lot of volume and had high margins for a fulfillment side because it's info instead of you know right. So we toggled all we ch we left everything the same. So we left all that traffic source acquisition the funnel to everything and instead on the sales call we just sold a different offer that was onetoone coaching and that's what got us from 10 to 30 right so just basically just a higher ticket offer and now you introduce your ARR more or less because you have annual contracts that then they can go for year two year three and there's like this whole game right so we hammered that with volume everything broke right now you have a whole fulfillment team so you have 70 coaches on the back end like literally 70 coaches 4000 thousand active members. You're going back and forth. You've got that whole side of the business. And then you have the constant game of the hamster wheel of filling the calendars and doing 150 30 minute calls a day across 20ome reps. So you've got 20 to 30 sales reps, management leaders. We did it with no setters up to 72 71 72 million no setters. So we just rolled out setters that whole division and then you've got your whole fulfillment side. And then as you know you then have your ops or middle management leadership HR book like everything you're talking about. So we scaled up so aggressively. We hired before it hurt. We hired when it hurt and margins went from this to this as a percentage. We made more dollars right from 10 to 30 uh in profit but not like you know the margin took a dive and in Q end of Q3 into Q4 acquisition was our major issue. So like CPA was going like this. We're trying to do agency thing instead of doing it in house. So we're paying 130 grand a month to manage a million in ad spend. We similar to you are 99% basically paid first click. We do have a massive content moat that like an organic moat that exists mainly for middle and bottom of funnel right like very very little first click. And yeah we just like completely rebuilt that whole team CMO marketer like this whole thing internal. Now CPA is like like killing it. Now we're doing the same thing with sales. We were, you know, stuck in the mid ones, right? Like 1.5 call it, and like essentially breaking even because of spend and team. Everyone's W2, so we moved everyone W2 in the US. So you got 130 people and you're, you know, 20% more than your 1099 wages. You just go down the list and it's like we're almost building to like you have to be above 1.5 to make money and a month and you have to uh Yeah. And you just have to build this in the direction of like you kind of need, you know, you don't need an exit necessarily to cash flow. really just have to get over that hump until you start to cash flow pretty heavy and then the real goal of what we're doing here with you know W2 and HR and build that out is to get there to get an exit. We have had one brand face we now have multiple brand faces. We've had one acquisition channel the VSSL funnel we now have three and now we have three brand faces so we're going to have nine right different VSSL funnels different low tickets move to the back blah blah blah. So there's like kind of the context, but I'm like where are we going and like what is necessary to diversify here to no founder risk here financials like how do we make this thing so the financials the you know ops and finance side are plugandplay that a PE company looks at it and can you know import it basically into their model in two seconds instead of have two weeks of conversations where we're going back and forth on how they understand things like that's where my frame is and this is still like years to come I'm imagining like to hit the numbers we want to but yeah man. Well, dude, you've successfully given me PTSD there. So, thank you very much. Yeah, it's my life. I'm living in it daily. Yeah, dude. It's Oh, God. I My acquisition was probably the number one most stressful period of my life. I missed my best friend's wedding cuz it was just a few weeks before we closed. It was It was a [ __ ] nightmare, but so so so worth it when we got to it. But anyway, to come to yourself, dude, what number do you want to sell for? I mean, if we do this the right way, I know two guys that have numbers that I want to get to that that use the exact same model that are 12 to 15 million a month right now. And it's like that's not unrealistic for us. Um, you know, that's with core model. We've never optimized for backend, which is like, you know, you can look at the core product as either the back end, the middle, the whatever, but you have some low ticket stuff and then you have the core core thing, which is the onetoone personalized training that's a year-long. And we have not even touched optimizations for multi-year after that. It's in the fitness space. So like have not even touched multi-year after that. Have not touched the downell continuity. So you know you got your personalization now you go into groups. You still get like a little bit of it but you stay for the community the access the app the stuff. So living in there we haven't touched physical products. So supplements we wanted to wait until we were at like 50 million a yearish doing you know good numbers to do supplements in that realm. There's the whole play to do front-end supplements. So like you know we have friends that do 15 million a month as well that are in physical products with one or two SKs like there's a whole game to be played here. Um, but if we do that, you know, to answer your question more directly, that could be, let's say it's 30% margins because obviously paid ads heavy. Let's say that's like the target. You're doing 10 and something. You're doing 20, 30, 40 million in IBIDA. Like, who knows what that could sell for if structured correctly. You know, you hear once you're in the tens and 20s, it's like a 10x. You hear, you hear, you hear, you hear, but like, you know, there could be a couple hundred play or this could be a complete pipe dream and it could just cash flow for x amount of time and just like exist as it exists, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I've I've got you, man. I mean I'm working with a private equity firm right now that are working on an info rollup and one of the first things that they said to me was we need to get above 50 million Ebidar so that we can sell to a a good private equity firm and really do something worthwhile. So my first thought when it comes to you is what do you want to sell for and if it's there's not a software component is is there? No the the only like tech component would be basically community layered on. So like yes, there maybe could be some internal tech at that point, but if it is, it's to service clientele. It's not like a standalone version. Yeah. Yeah. Got it, man. So what do you want to sell for? There's no software. So you're probably going to be classed as a media business like we were when we sold. So if it's anything like what I learned, 2.5 to about 4x was what my uh what what I was told by my M&A adviser when we were going through the process. So working backwards from that, what do you want to sell for? What would the ebidar need to be at, let's say, 3x? And then you need to get to that ebidar. And honestly, if there's one thing that I learned, it's often all this [ __ ] that people say is from people that haven't sold that say like, you need to do this, you need to do this. That's where I'm at. Yeah. You know, it's it's it's it's an interesting one for sure. But dude, I've got no doubt that that you'll get there. It's just a matter of time. Yeah, it's definitely a matter of structure and like if you look at the P&L, you look at whatever right now, like it's pain. I'm going to be completely I'm very honest about that on here. Like I've been making videos for whatever 78 90 whatever days uh 80 days today. And uh I have videos in there in the beginning where it's like we're doing 1.5, we have two days in a row where we lose like like lose lose on day, which is crazy cuz like we didn't we haven't had that for years and we were in a rough spot. like a rough spot and now it has in the last two or three weeks like really flipped on its head. It's you know in the hundred plus a day steady state. Uh and that was just some changes that happened in sales. So like marketing continuing same lead flow and then it's the people thing right at this size for us what we've seen more and more is just like it's the people it's the people. So trying to replace and then trying to keep culture trying to keep um you know performance trying to keep all of that tied in one is is the game that we've gotten to. And like right now, let's say that's sales. Next it'll be fulfillment. I'm sure we already broke marketing, now we're fixing sales and like kind of doing this game. Um, but yeah, I think uh what you said for those targets of call it 3x, you hear all the things and this is where it's like at what point do you almost like bring an M&A in even if it's pre like it, you know, a fractional CFO, fractional CO that comes from private equity. you full hire a COO or CFO that comes in from private equity to run that thing for a year or two to make it so oh yeah these you know ratios are checked these hit this you hear that you get into the you know mid7 or start to get into the eight figure IBI range the multiple clims inherently right and these are all things you just hear that mean nothing until they're actually in an LOI or even until it closes not even the LOI right like and I understand that it's just it's that crazy dynamic of like you're building and you're biting the cash to have it in a place that is ready to sell that could never sell. And like you're just kind of playing that game. You hear the guys talk about it that are like, "Oh, you need, you know, optimize for profit and then if an exit happens, it happens." And that's kind of where my mind's at is like optimize for that number because it will drive an exit anyway. But like the the game of paying for team and making it a machine, biting the whatever five or 10 points that off that of current cash for an exit and a lifestyle, right, that it could be sold or not. There's there's so many things there's so many directions that that I want to go with you. I'm trying to just keep it simple. But if I wanted to exit, right, I would just think to myself, well, what am I going to be classed as in this space? It's going to be media, number one. Number two, what am I likely to get two and a halfx to about 4x ebidar? What do I want to sell for when I know what I realistically want to sell for? I would just get myself to the ebidar that I need to be at to get there. The minute that I'm either at the ebidar or very close, I'd bring in an M&A adviser, okay? Build out an IM that I can take out to market. when I've got the investor memorandum, he can go and start sending that out while we're still stabilizing things. Because that's what happened to us, right? We decided we wanted to sell. I think it was like November 2022 and we didn't have a good offer until I think it was February. We had a VC firm from Canada interested. Two months fell through. Then we had uh High View came along in April, signed the LOI pretty much straight away. and then April, May, June, July, August, September. Yeah. So, it took us pretty much five full months to to sell. But along the way, they were they were kind of teaching me what what they wanted almost. So, it wasn't like we love your business, let's just buy it and and go. It was like, can we do this? Can we implement this? Let's stop doing this. Can we get rid of this? So, we kind of we kind of got it right for them along the way. Yeah. Really? Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. I mean, that's cool for both of you, right? It's like you got your exit and they got the business ready basically right under your helm at some point for the transition. Like that's kind of clean. I mean, obviously the five, six months was probably a bit painful, but the uh Yeah. Also, we almost lost the sale as well. So, I was in England uh cuz I was going to celebrate the sale with my family. So, I was in a hotel in England and I got an email one night from the uh Dominic, my M&A adviser, and he was like, "Oh, Carl wants to have a call with you tomorrow morning. it's it's serious and it's urgent. So, we got on the call and they were basically like, "Yeah, we found all these errors in the P&L and this doesn't match the aging report that you gave us and this is not what you told us." Then we had to quickly, it was super expensive to rebuild the books. So, we almost lost that sale. They knocked a few hundred,000 off and and went ahead in the end. Yeah. But even right up to the last day, I was like hating my [ __ ] life to say the least. So, stressful, but worth it. Did you uh so what was the purpose for them to buy it like how what was their plan because right they and kind of two things it's like what was the deal structure and the reason I asked that is because like are you along for the ride on the next step right is there like some portion of it and then also what was their plan and why are they willing to pay you know 3x or whatever number for this what's their plan with it yeah for sure so the deal structure I sold them 80% of the company for 2.6x 6x ebidar kept 20% for myself. Uh they gave me 38% cash up front and the rest in a payment plan over two years with 10% interest added uh per year. They made me stay in. So we closed on September 29th. They made me stay in until January 1st and just do pretty much a call with them every day to hold a hand and and get them uh integrated. And the reason that they wanted to buy us was to turn us into a SAS or add a SAS element, grow the company and resell it. That's why they they wanted to buy us. And one of the key drivers for them was our paid ads. So we'd we'd never ever ever had a losing month on the paid ads in god three odd years. Nice. And when they saw that, that gave them a lot of peace of mind to see, you know, every single one that ever has been at least profitable. And uh the team pretty much everyone we ever hired was was still there on the the last day, give or take a couple of sales reps. So I think they just saw how stable it was. They like the model, they love the profitability, and they thought that they could add to it and uh and grow it and resell it, which is is still the goal for them. So yeah. So how's it going for them? Cuz that was what you said a year ago. It was Yeah. Where it's about a year and a half ago now. Okay. And then So yeah. So you hold 20%. So you're still getting your monthly updates and like you are you guys doing distributions out of it? Is it like a in the future only no cash flow? It is an in the future only uh scenario. So I hear from them every four, five, six weeks with an update. I've got to meet with the partners every now and again to steer them in the right direction. Anything big that they do, they still run it by me when they make kind of like major pivots. Um, and otherwise, they're just building for that future goal of their next exit. Really? Yeah. So, yeah. Cool. Have they uh have they made some aggressive changes? You could say that. You could say that. Yeah. This is something maybe we should talk about uh when this is not being recorded because I'm Yeah, it's fine. No, no, no. 100%. Yeah. I was joking. we'll we'll talk on here and like not docs. We're like we don't have to say numbers, we don't have to say people, we don't say anything. Like no need. Of course, dude. I I've already name dropped off the people anyway, but they've definitely made some changes where I was like that is really really not a a good idea. Within about about 14 days of the acquisition, they lost probably one of the most important people in the company because they just didn't get along. like the the the kind of guy that came in to lead. Some people just didn't resonate with him and and rightly so. Even though the team knew that we were selling in in advance, everybody knew that we were selling. They had to because they were interviewing all the team and interviewing all the customers and going through everything. But there was a couple of people that when they bought they were like, "Yeah, we just don't want to be here anymore. This is not the vision that we signed up for." You know, which is which is fair enough. I think that's always going to happen. but still going to this day, still building and growing, still profitable, still still doing doing what they want to do. So, yeah. Yeah. Very cool. And then when you said they were buying, you know, they're a big fan of the acquisition side of the business. Is that for you guys? Is that like an in-house? And I I don't know where this is based out of or what the W2 comparable is, but like for us, we've heard having, you know, basically an agency or contractors that run any piece of the business is like this inherent risk because they could just walk, you know, with 14-day notice based on whatever 1099 agreement. Like did you guys have the team inhouse and that they were buying this acquisition team at at some level? Did you have it outsourced? Like how'd that work? It's funny. I asked my lawyer Poppy this this question. I said like, "What if I ever want to take some of those team members with me into the next thing?" And she said, "Well, that's illegal. You can't poach them. You can't take them with you, but you can't stop them quitting. You know, the PE firm can't stop them from quitting on their own back and coming to work for you." So, she was like, "It's a bit of a weird weird area, but you can't stop people from leaving." No. You know, but I think this is why it's so important. If I was going to buy a business, man, I would really want to spend time with that team and be like, "Listen, this is what I want to do. This is what I'm going to do. Are you a part of this? Be honest. Are you going to leave on me when I buy this [ __ ] thing so I can start rebuilding another team?" And they were smart enough to do that. You know, they [ __ ] interviewed people some people god knows how many times before they bought. So, yeah, they they clearly knew what they were doing. But but to answer your question more directly, dude, uh they were all contractors. H interesting. Yeah, we to we pulled triggers so early. We were in it was this past summer and it was like the peak of peaks like we were doing like 2.7. We were doing a spe we didn't we do internal specials are like the only like actual promos we do and it'll be basically the second year for a discounted rate and we'll crack like 2 million bucks in like a week and we'll just do like this whole thing into the next one. So, I I think our top month was 3.7 something. Like, we're like on this high. We're like, "All right, let's get in this direction. Everything's perfect. Momentum's there." Uh, but CPA was rising and we're like, we're cognizant of that, but we're still filling calendars. We're just like trying to figure it out, but not hard enough or not well enough probably. And, uh, moved everybody, whole company, 1099 to W2, that whole process, 37 states, x amount of countries that are still 1099, but on a different agreement, like everyone need all these systems and then it was like boom. So you got everyone on salary now. So everyone's, you know, sales reps as an example are making draws. So they have their 45K a year base and then once they cross over that in commission, the commission just takes over. But you have half filled calendars and you have people who maybe don't perform, you know, all mixed into one and you all of a sudden the floor there's a literal floor now of whatever it is. I think it's 1,600 bucks or whatever for every pay period and you've got 20 30 of them that exist and like you don't fill their calendar. Like it just gets crazy. Um and yeah, that all happened at once for us. And we the reason the main reason we did that was for like you know obviously classification never we didn't we're very black and white. We never want to like cross that gray line or like well let's operate like this just like for the cash and then do this like you just want to sleep easy at night. But one of the things we've heard is W2 W2 W2. Um and again we're in the States so I think a little bit different potentially but interesting that you're all contractors. Yeah. It's it's so strange man. like everything that I seem to do just goes against what everyone's saying should be done. Right. Right. Down to to what we're doing now. But but there we go. But when when you're talking about that stuff in my head, I'm just thinking like, what's your goal? What's your goal? What do you want? You know, where where are you going? And it sounds like I mean, you're a better entrepreneur than me, dude. I've I've got so [ __ ] lazy now. I don't want to do all this crazy [ __ ] um and build a a massive business. I want to just keep it as simple and profitable and fun as possible. So, but you're on a different mission. I think you're just you're going for the exit, aren't you? And you know what's got to be done to get there. Yeah. And the cash flow on the way up, right? I want to make sure that we build this in a way, but complete understanding that in which is crazy to even say, but you know, at the 20s something million or whatever number, it's like it's it's break even call it with the paid ads and that it's it's crazy. And that's like, you know, you hear about Ovens when he was doing 30 million with like a million in profit and like these crazy numbers. And then you hear Iman who's done, you know, 70 million with 70% margin because organic and lean and 1099 that whole game. And it's like, yeah, we're definitely uh unconventional and maybe stupid and I will accept that fully uh with how we're like building this thing. But yeah, we have to build it for the bigger thing or there's or it's or it's too much work. It's too much too many headaches for what it produces. And that's been the case more or less for the last 6 months like getting it back on track. But with the understanding that when this thing peaks out the other side, it's like it drops a ton to the bottom line. It is clean. You know, it has this big brand. It has more backend now availabilities. We haven't even touched the other like opportunities or monetization methods, the partnerships, the, you know, the physical products, the all that. Yeah. Well, dude, don't forget to leave some meat on the bone for an acquire acquirer because that would make a great story. you know, like I'm dude, you could go to someone right now and say, "Listen, we're doing this blah blah blah. There's all this other [ __ ] to be done." You know, even if you only sold, I don't know, 30%, 50%, some something like that. I don't know what the plan is, but yeah, leave some of that stuff on the bone for the acquirer. Sure. Yeah, we're swinging for the fences and uh we'll see. We'll see, right? Cuz like right now there's so many versions of that. It's like is it just the the geo, right? Like we only sell North America right now and and for example because there's one-on-one coaching. So there's like a lot of communication calls. It's not just a course or like group coaching. So it's all North America because coaches fulfillment is all North America. So it's like there's that whole model. We have not done anything low ticket. You know the people in our space call it like a like a Vshred for example or you know some others that you know they're huge. They're a couple hundred million last I heard in in topline. You know a thousand new customers a day. I've I've heard I've heard thousands of customers a day have low ticket like they have a machine direct response guys and they just crush it. Um there's another company in the space that actually just closed down. They like kind of sold um that we initially modeled ours off of but they were you know inc top 10. They were a couple hundred million a year. Tons of supplements once they got up to scale. It was info coaching but then supplements. and they got you know basically based on their messages or their posts about this got at some level like burned out. It was this next iteration in level. They made their tens of millions you know from cash flow and they were just looking to get out sell you know digital assets and um Facebook was rising costs were rising physical product business now like this whole game. Um, so yeah, but like there's just not a lot of compare like comps to use that are direct other than like these fitness apps that have hundreds of thousands of users, which like that's not our game, right? It's not this low ticket recurring game that a lot of these guys have, which is like Yeah. So, it's just difficult for us to kind of navigate. Is it a 3x? Is it some like 10x thing? Because now we're in this game of, you know, revenue retention that's insane and we're in the thresholds of, you know, mid 8 figure or I guess low eight figure uh Ibida like I don't know. So, we'll see. Crazy, man. Yeah. I think as as you were saying that, I was thinking like what are the differences between the businesses that you can sell that you can't sell that are easier. I think this is an obvious one, but I think it's just paid ads, you know? So, if you've got that stability and control of profitable paid ads and you've got a good track record, I think it's a lot easier if you've got just organic like we do now. Like, I'd be hardfaced to sell this company. I think I' I'd like to try in the future, but this is this is a whole different ball game. I love what you said about uh bringing in you said different faces, right, to the uh to the business. Think I lost you for a second. You're back. Oh, I was just saying to you there, dude. Um you said you were bringing in different faces to the the business, right? Yeah. So, we're going to have different Yeah, we're going to have different faces. we're going to so the the acquisition side cuz for the longest time we're like we're an acquisition company and now we see it in a lot of different ways I guess now it's been a very strong uh learning curve these last probably six months but we we view the front now much more direct response and we are building it in that way so it's like how do we do this that is the most efficient way possible to generate customers that all through paid so it is currently the three funnel types and I want to get into your stuff and like how you're currently running this new model cuz I and super interesting and I and I looked into it and deep researched you and all the things but um the current model for acquisition is basically one brand face that's one that's the co-founder absolute badass like lifeblood of the company like you know the the visual representation of the company um she and we have a VSSL funnel technically two opt-in funnels we have a direct to VSSL funnel which a lot of these guys run now I call it D uh DTA direct to app headline VSSL application and then we have uh low ticket ascension funnel which the econ economics are crazy good on. So you're, you know, small, call it sub $50 thing and then instead of optimizing for AOV and having the upsell track and all that kind of stuff, instead it's optimized for uh calls. So it pushes them to book like a starter implementation call. They talk to a setter for 15 minutes, then they set with the closer. It has the highest show rates, the highest close rates, and now it's a percent game. So can you get 5% of the 100 people that buy a day to ascend into a low ticket? what's the time from lead or buyer more so to backend buyer and try and shrink that window. So like we were trying to play that game but you introduce all three of those and our CPA is like because they they're in this one and they hit this and like just the ecosystem is getting more advanced and then yeah to answer directly for your question we have that right now and we have three brand faces all in all in the ads going to brand face one's videos for the VSSL and like all this and it works it crushes. So, we don't even have the continuity yet or the congruency across of having brand phase 2 with the VSSL that's brand phase 2 and their story going to this. And that's what we just shot. That's what we have, you know, five funnels in the pipeline right now being built because we're going to have on the front end to diversify. Love it. Love it, dude. It reminds me of what uh Dave Ramsey's done with like the Ramsey personalities, you know? It's I think it's so [ __ ] smart. He's basically like taken him got other people just to reddo what he does, remake the content that he makes. It's like mini Dave Ramsey's all driving traffic back to the the main thing. I just think that's fascinating. Yeah, I think it just, you know, we it's horosy, right, is like who we consume around this that that speaks on this majority in info coaching. You have Cody Sanchez, you have, you know, um what's the other guy's name? Um I'm blanking but like the buy biz sell her whole thing about buying boring businesses but like they do all talk about online business exits and like they're the first ones to kind of own that conversation and all of them talk about acquisition issues but and sources too which I didn't really talk about is like we're very very heavy on meta and very little like we haven't full cracked Google we spend you know mid single whatever mid four figures a day there but we don't at all versus like we're spending 30 grand a day and a majority of it's on meta and then the rest is sitting over here on Google and it's, you know, all your branded stuff, all your retargeting, sure, but like we haven't cracked cold and like that's a vulnerability or like a risk point is having so much in one bucket, right? It's like, so we're just trying to figure out all the layers of that all at the same time and it's kind of a Yeah, it's a little chunky, but is it a risk or is it an opportunity? I don't know the answer to that. I don't know. So because this is I mean it's so funny like high view that bought us they just came in with their ideas you know there was not I I didn't make any suggestions to them but if there's one thing that I've learned from especially from my mentor Dan it's like it's all in the story and even the PE firm that I'm working with now to do the info roll up one of the first things that the founder said we've got to craft a good story and give them the reason why they should buy it to do this other stuff afterwards and it sounds like you've got loads of that to give to people. Oh, you can add supplements on, you can do this, you can crack this channel. So, it sounds like there's a lot of juice left to squeeze and like do you want to squeeze it and then sell or do you want to sell sooner but for maybe a bit less but I don't know, give them more opportunity so there's a stronger story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, we definitely want to hammer it. I think leading up to just because the TAM is so big, the monetization models are so big. It's like we can probably eat half of them and still leave the rest like on the bone. Uh which I think will be cool. But so yeah, let's talk about you. So now that you've done this lifestyle, so this is the Dubai uh or I'm sorry, this is the Dubai gone Bali vibe, right? So are you in both? Is it now this lifestyle? Like where you at with life? Where am I at? Well, yeah. I think dude, I'm just doing the complete opposite of what I did in the last company, you So, we used to have a massive team and I've got a tiny team. We used to have a tiny profit margin and now we've got a pretty [ __ ] high profit margin. It used to be all paid ads and t very little organic and now it's all organic and very little paid ads. So, it's just like the complete opposite of of the old business. I I just learned my lessons. I learned what I want and and and what I like, you know, and I was pretty burned out. I was burned out by the end of the company and I was especially burned out after the acquisition. So again, my plan was have no team, run no ads, start a YouTube channel, get a few consulting clients, make 30, 40, 50k a month profit, and just chill a bit more, enjoy my life a little bit more, invest the the money that that I'd kind of built up. And then when the YouTube channel blew up, dude, like it happened so [ __ ] fast, you know? I just had I had this one video which was called something like uh how to make 10K a month ASAP or or something and good god I've never seen so many sales calls get booked so fast and I quickly had to hire two reps to help me with with the volume before that happened. Right, I was taking the sales calls myself and I had my calendar set to like 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. like 10 days out and I was getting no calls. I was booking one or two or three calls a week, you know, from from from the YouTube. And then when that video blew up, man, [ __ ] hell. Like, yeah, it it was wild. And then I just capitalized on it basically. And uh the business grew really fast and we only had one offer back then. I was just charging £5,000 a month for one call a week, uh basically. And I had a few people in that. And then when the YouTube channel blew up, we got loads of people on calls that either couldn't afford that or weren't right for it. So, we made a group uh program to go alongside it. Then we got someone on a call one day that said, "Listen, could you please do it for for me and I don't care what the price is." Then we made a done for you program to satisfy that guy. It's our bestselling program now. And it just kind of slowly grew up to where we are today. So now we're doing about depending on the month about 450 to 600 cash. Uh team of seven. The margin last month was 83.1%. So it's just like a a profitable fun little little machine now, you know? That's Yeah, that's fun. That's fun. How are you doing so much done for you with such a light team? Dude, I it's it's it's really simple. So like if you came in today, this is this is what would happen. If you came in today, I would say, right, go through the training program first. Take four, five, six, seven days. Go right through the program. That's going to put my brain in your head. and then booking your first call with me and here's my calendar. Right? So people go into the program, five, six, seven, eight days later they book a call. I get on a one-to-one with them. And we call it a blueprint call. I just help them design their offer, the price, the funnel, just everything. And then they go to my copywriter and I'm like, "Right, book in with with W and get on with your ads and VSSL or what whatever it is." W disappears for 7 to 10 to 14 days, comes back with a VSSL, a set of ads, the copy that they need. Then I show them how to produce everything. So it's back to me. They produce, let's say, the VSSL and the ads. Uh we've got a go high level white label. So they sign up to the white label which has already got the funnel and emails and everything in there. Yeah. We connect it all up for them. They get on a call with my media buyer who will set everything up, the tracking, get everything turned on, and that's it. So it's just me, my copywriter, and and my media buyer. It's super simple. That's amazing. That's literally amazing. Yeah, it's easy. And then yeah, you you know keep your 30 40% of that that would go to ads because it's all organic now, right? It's all organic. Yeah, that's amazing. And then just like a lean sales team because you're doing Is there anything direct to cart? Well, direct to Well, we've got our bookfunnel, right, which is where we spend some money on. We're spending about 12k a month on ads right now. So, not a lot. And that's the only ad spend we run. So they can buy the book and then they're pushed to a VSSL to book a call. But if for every hundred calls that we book, 70 will come from YouTube, 20 will come from Instagram, 10 will come from LinkedIn/tobookfunnel basically. So it's like heavily weighted to YouTube. Yeah. How's the bookunnel going? Well, the book math on it or just feedback or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So it's very profitable. So we're about 4x 5 1/2x territory, but the sales cycle is long as [ __ ] you know, like we So the front end is about 0.32 right now. So we'll spend a,000, lose 700 nod, and we only do two three sales a month, but because our prices are so high, that two, three sales immediately puts us in 4x, 5x, 6x uh cash territory. So, it's very profitable, but not fast and not particularly great. We're about to start spending a bit more. I'm just making a new batch of ads and we're going to push on the gas a bit. We've just finally got a setter now to start. This is so stupid. I know how stupid this is, but we didn't even have anyone dialing the [ __ ] leads for months because we were just so profitable that we didn't [ __ ] care, you know? But now we're starting to take things more seriously. Yeah. No, that's amazing. um the the book funnels the consumption around that is just so I talk about that a lot on here like the the difference in those funnel types the frictions like you know as a function of consumption right you have a DTA funnel where it's like someone can apply in 2 seconds your show rates are like this the close rates like this because they don't have as much context versus an opt-in person that is forced to watch VSSL or consume emails resources before they get to the application and like just trying to do that but the book funnel is a very interesting one to me cuz you know the physical book on a shelf it sits on someone's coffee table, they read it and they actually consume that thing and they spend however many hours, you know, reading in your voice and in your story in your, you know, really like selling themselves and consuming. Um, so for us and maybe this will for you guys, but if you lose like let me do some math here, but you know, if you're losing I don't want to give you know our exact numbers. That's the one thing I don't talk about. I don't talk about our exact cost structure necessarily. I talk about like every number in the world. I'm just not on like daily spend. We're kind of you know 30 right now. it was 18 x amount of days ago. Like it all changes. But like if you're losing 50 bucks a unit and that ascension rate is like five. So between your setter, between your, you know, CTAs in the book, between if you give them a a master, like there's this whole game around that, you know, that's $1,000 CPA on the back, right? 5% ascend. And then it's what time frame does that take? So that's the game we're playing a little bit with this is like how do you crack cold where you can sell a hundred of those books a day and go in the hole you know pretty extensively for sure but you know the time to lead and for us what I heard we right now will just do that like I said book a call with a setter and then book a call with a closer so the time frame is really like the average of close is like 5 days which is amazing instead of having this huge drawn out one um and that's again the average of the closes not the average if you include everyone and like blend it out um or thus far. But we then drop them into cuz it's a low ticket course. So you have like all the content they're consuming, you're constantly pushing them back into the education, the community aspect as well. And then you have we have very light on the setters honestly too. Like we leave some on the table there, but there's CTAs all in there. And then there's emails that all go back to there that's pushing them to either book that call or apply direct with a closer, which is like, you know, the two different ones. Um, but yeah, you get that thing up to 5% and you're in like honeypot territory of Yeah, that's that's the goal, mate. Yeah, we're we're really going all in on the book funnel now and kind of taking things a bit more serious. So, I' I've had my fun for the last year and a half and now I want to get get my hands dirty again, you know. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, that's Dude, those numbers are amazing. Amazing. Yeah, they [ __ ] are. Yeah, they [ __ ] are. Yeah. 83% margin like you know anything over like 50 to me is just like so a like I just haven't really seen it at scale with paid ads unless it's you know years of cooked and backend and all that where you have 95% you know gross margin cuz however the fulfillment model is you don't have the ads you don't have the spend you know all the stuff on the back to where it can offset it but if you're scaling into front end heavily it's like you're constantly playing this game of it's like driving down over here for this future number and that's that whole game of like you know operating to sell or operating for future everything just in life. It's like if you're doing stuff now for this future thing instead of like for today, you're just constantly paying that price in dollars and time and whatever. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Exactly. If there's one thing that I've learned, it's like whatever you focus on, the other things will be be rocky, but you'll get what you want from focus. So, there was a time in the last business where honestly we were just like, how much revenue can we can we do? And that to me now is really [ __ ] stupid. And I can't believe I thought that way. But I remember saying to my sales team manager, how how big can we grow and we'll we'll sacrifice profit to see? And we did and we grew massive rev and smashed the the profit margin, you know, and then in this business now the focus is let's keep like, dude, my number one focus is just the profit margin. Every goddamn month, I'm thinking, what can we do? What can we change to keep the profit margin as high as possible? So, I've got what I want, a lot of profit, but at the cost of revenue, at the cost of scale, at the cost of reaching more people, having a bigger business, you know, so you get what you want, but you'll lose the other things that when you take your eye off the ball. That makes sense. Yeah. No, 100%. And the other thing I hear, and this is where I'm interested to see, like the what's your lifestyle like right now? Because the other thing a lot of people a lot of people are willing to sacrifice in terms of lifestyle for margins like that but it doesn't seem like you have that issue as much. Yeah. Well, so I still do one-to-one consulting, right? And it's it's very unscalable. So we we've got the three main programs. The group program which is easy because it's two hours a week for one call. the one-to-one program uh where people get anytime one-to-one and a WhatsApp chat with me and the done for you program and the most intense for me is the one-to-one. So, we've worked out that people book about three calls with me a month for for 45 minutes per per person. And I usually do three full call days per week, which will be like 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. with a gap in the afternoon. So, it's just like call call. Thankfully, I really enjoy it, you know, and if the day comes where I don't enjoy it, I'll just turn it off and maybe keep the group and keep the done for you or something like that. So, for now, I really really enjoy it just like this. It's just like chatting to people and and helping them. It's it's easy. It's so easy and fun. And the lifestyle is pretty pretty empty. It's it's nice. I just usually do the three cold days, four days off, and I just make YouTube videos, read, chat to the team, go play tennis, go to the gym, you know, and and just kind of chill. And it's like what I wanted really is is what I've got right now. But I'm starting to get bored. I'm starting to think like, ah, I want to I want to I want to scale again, you know? I want to I want to grow this thing bigger, which is why we're focusing on the book funnel now. So yeah, it's just seasons, you know? I had my season of [ __ ] stress. Now I've had my season of peace. Now I'm up for a bit more stress again. So yeah, back to the chaos a little bit. Back to the chaos. Yeah. Yeah. So you're doing So you are like full in Bali or you're going to bounce. What's What's the plan there? Did you say? Yeah. Well, one of my dreams was to have like a global infrastructure. I wanted to have like a forever home in Bali, a forever home in Dubai, forever home in England so I could see my parents. And I've got the one in uh Bali. I'm about to buy the one in in Dubai and the plan is really six months, six months. So, six months Bali, six months Dubai. And I was thinking, you know, six months of peace and chilling and then six months of Dubai stress in in the desert. So, we we'll see. That's that's the plan. Yeah. Cool. And yeah, that's so fun. We uh super random tangent, but the uh I went to Changenu or and uh was there for I went to for like a developer course which is hilarious now looking back but like that had to have been almost 10 years or you know 8 years ago and went out there stayed right on like you know Echo Beach right on that line and did a developer course there for 2 months I had never been went alone and stayed in some like hostile thing cuz I had zero money and basically like just went to this class and did that and then fast forward x amount of years later I started working with this company and I'm technically like co-owner not co-founder. So, I was like number four or five on the team and then became, you know, co uh co-owner through this process um of of scaling it and growing. And they I worked with them for probably three or four months and they were living out there for 3 or 4 months and they were like, "Yeah, come on out." And the f I literally got on a plane and the first time I met the team and the you know, other owners and partners of this business was meeting them in person and staying in a villa there with them for like a month and some change and that was right before COVID hit. Like I flew out of there because world was in mania mode and no one knew it was going to happen and I left after that. So I was there for like a month in a villa probably down the street with those guys and just building in person. Dude, Bali is the best man. Bali just got like a fun chilled vibe. You know, Dubai for me was too heavy. Like Dubai was just too too heavy, too tense. I would like not leave the apartment or not leave like, you know, the building area with a cafe downstairs and [ __ ] and it was just too heavy, too tense. I needed to snap out, you know, and Barley's just been being great for that. But it's a matter of time until I want that energy back and I'm back over there going hard again. But for now, I'm good. Yeah. So, like network-wise, I mean, you have to have an insane access to network. I feel like you're, you know, you're one of the ones on a handful, right, that I think about in this game and space. Everything you're doing with organic and like, you know, you come out as a leader, a, you know, one of the thought thought people of this area that I think really stand out. Um, so like, do you have access to all the all the network and talent? Like when you go and travel places, you guys, are you one of those guys who likes to like set up the dinners and do all the stuff and meet everyone or are you more of like the chill, move in silence? I don't know. A a bit of both. A bit of both to be honest. I mean, I've I've been lucky because I met so many people in Becca's mastermind. I met so many people in S. Which one? Which one did he have? He he had a mastermind called Iron. Yeah, that's I was in that. Oh, you were in that as well. Yeah. So, I bought uh that's how that's how we learned how to do the YouTube ads and that's the initial uh VSSL template that we used that we did like probably 15 20 million through was that I think the short form one you had on there. And then he had the long form, short form, uh, direct to call one. Yeah, dude. That [ __ ] iron, iron changed my life, man. It's made me so much goddamn money. But yeah, I met so many people through that. I met so many people through Sam Oven's mastermind, so many people through Cole Gordon's mastermind. And when I was in Dubai, I think people must have like seen my YouTube. And then when they come to Dubai, they would just message me all all the bloody time. I was doing dinners all the [ __ ] time with uh with people as they they came through. So I lost you for a second. But yes, they're coming to Dubai and you can see Yeah, there you go. back. Um yeah, no, that that's hilarious you say that though. Bloody Bali internet, man. I need to sort this [ __ ] internet out. They promised me that it would be that it would be good speed, but never mind. Never mind. But uh never mind that. But that's crazy you say that about iron. That's uh you know those are OG days. That thing was what 5 10 grand like sub and it was a onetime thing and it was hitters in there. Yeah, dude. I I think I paid six grand. It was like six or sevenk like disgustingly cheap. But yeah, be being in Dubai really really helped with with network, you know, because I'd go to a party with a friend, meet, you know, two, three other people that I that I, you know, know there, go for dinner with one of them, and then meet four other people, go to this person's apartment, and there's other people at that apartment, you know, and all of a sudden all the big guys, you end up with them a party or a dinner or a mastermind or something like that. So Dubai was amazing for for the network and it got me a lot of clients as well. Like being in Dubai and the YouTube got me some really like highle clients that I don't think I would have had if I wasn't in in Dubai in person, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did the Puerto Rico thing for the last x amount of years, which is like the US version of that where like the tax zone of that, right? So super isolating for me. I'm not somebody who leaves the desk very often. So like exactly what you're saying like go downstairs to the grocery or the gym that's in the base of the building and like that's it back to the desk and I think there's a much bigger opportunity very similar pocket of people right from us but I just didn't really do it and I ended up leaving cuz I was like I just don't have you know friends and stuff down here and I want to kind of try and continue on on life and not just focus on the money in that way you know at that level cuz you're really only there for that like a lot of people. Um beautiful weather, beautiful whatever but you can get that in a lot of other places. Um but that's interesting you say that. So for meeting people out there for meeting you know people you work with or that have become clients in some capacity what do you view as like where's the line on how you how far you want to take the business model and like these clients so and and where I'm going with this and the example is I talked to Iman right I bought Iman's course thing for their mastermind it's like 20 G's or whatever it was really what it was is kicking the ass to just make videos and now every day I've just made videos and it's worked we hit the goal that he and I talked about but in the beginning it was that exact same model. It was like build this thing up, build your core company, basically build a network, monetize it through a couple one-on- ones if you want to where you can make a couple million bucks a year having one-on-one clients. But he gave this example of this guy he knew that makes tens of millions a year in like, you know, basically cash from these things where he does coaching style, but the monetization model is percentage and ownership. So instead of you know paying you 25 grand or 50 grand for your done for you or your coaching situation you get ownership in them and you coach through either onetoone or group coaching but your your your your payment model is that. So what do you think about that? What do you think about changing the monetization model to where you have you know I don't know exactly who you're who that is but for you Yeah. Yeah. It's funny, man, like you well, number one, you a couple of people that you've interviewed have have been my clients in in the past. Really awesome to see those guys on here as well. And someone said, I can't remember who said this, but someone that you interviewed said, would you rather do like two and a half mil a month with a 20% margin or like 6 7 800k a month with like an 80% margin? And he was like, I'd rather have the 2 and a half mil, right? A 20% margin. I was like, "Fuck that [ __ ] I'd rather have 600 a month with a [ __ ] 90% margin," you know, and and I've heard Iman say that in the the past. So, for sure I for me like I want to keep it not as small as possible. I I want it to be as big as it can be, but I wouldn't scale and sacrifice profit where as I did do that in my last company and I wouldn't do that again. But with a caveat though, I don't want to exit this business though. If I did want to exit this business, whole different story. I'd be bringing in licensed coaches, bringing in CSM, stopping the onetoone, running paid ads, you know. So, the fact that I don't want to sell, and the fact that I just focus on profit, it's it's a great model. As long as you're willing to do the the onetoone coaching, which I am, this is a [ __ ] great model because you can charge way more. And we charge high ticket recurring as well, which we we can talk about. Um, but with that said, if the day comes that I stop enjoying the onetoone, I would either go group or I would go the Hermosi model and and come in and take equity and just get three or four or five massive clients and go all in. And I I'll probably do that next when that day comes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, obviously I I agree with you like with what we're building, if I was to build another one, it would be this huge backend model. It would be all that kind of stuff, but it would really also be what you're saying like these really high margin and kind of more lean and focused just cuz I've seen how this one plays out and how much you know how many headaches there can be and the people things and all the things. But I do wonder if you even in current state could do something that you kept the fulfillment model but you just changed the monetization model. So instead of right instead of having just this like high ticket recurring which is obviously amazing and is you know directly contributes to what you just said is your goal. Uh but the other side of it is if you can get that percent. It was just so interesting to me to hear that someone was making multiple eight figures a year in basically distributions because and and the and the fulfillment model is the same as yours. It's, you know, I to my understanding it was actually a couple group coaching calls and then the people who'd show up are the founders or partners and they would be in group setting which is even crazier uh than onetoone but like imagine that right you have six group coach calls or whatever five a week it's one a day people just pop on and the founders or the partners just ask questions you own 10 or 40 or whatever percent of the company you deploy some of your light team but you know same lifestyle and fulfillment model but because you get percentage or upside or and who knows right if anything ever sells in that world or who knows if that's but just an interesting idea. Yeah, I I appreciate you planting that in my head because you you're completely right. I think can it be done? Well, clearly yes. To what degree acquisition would be interesting, but I'm definitely open. I mean, dude, right now I'm just in [ __ ] around and find out mode. Yeah, basically. So, I'll I'll probably try that. I'll probably try that. Um, but for now it's pretty well balanced, dude. Something that really actually doubled our business, right? One of my closers said to me last December because basically it's just it was just pay monthly. And one of my closers said, "Will, what do you think would happen if we let people buy multiple months on day one and we gave them like free months, so like buy two get one free or buy three get two free, that kind of thing." And we tried it and doubled the business, like pretty much doubled the business like overnight. It was [ __ ] amazing. That was crazy. Yeah. Yeah. We just went to uh Onyx and Gaul's event and and he's very obvious, you know, he's the transparent guy around this stuff. He's like just know, you know, we will, you know, sell you on this. We are going to attempt to sell you on the mastermind on the back end of this. And uh for him, he was like a lot of these guys and two two for example, you join and it's I forget his numbers right now. So this is, you know, not doxing or anything because I actually don't remember. It's five grand, it's 20 grand, it's whatever number is basically like your startup. And then starting month two or three, it becomes the monthly thing and then they live within there. I know that's the same thing that uh Ezra Firestone when we initially joined that for his blue ribbon mastermind. It's whatever chunk up front and then this like mid to high ticket, call it anywhere from 1,500 to 3 or 4,000 a month that just sits there then on the books and then you have your fulfillment. It's your group coaching. you can get access to all the courses uh and then you know once or twice a year events was a was a lot of how those a lot of those guys model it like that. Yeah. I you you know who Taylor Welches, right? Yeah. Yeah. I I really Yeah, I know. Taylor I really liked his model of uh I think it was something like 35 to get in and two a month to stay in. I thought that was a really good model, man. It's not not quite right for what we do. But I think that was a great model because you don't want to leave, you know, when when you've paid that down. So it's so sticky, you know, so sticky. So yeah, I mean I almost said his name earlier because I've built some of some tech stack stuff with him and you know back when I was just doing a lot of marketing tech and he's a very interesting dude but he has a similarish story of you know he's got his loss he posted at one point of where everything was worth like 90 million and you know trying to do that with the traffic and funnel sides and then exact same thing he was like I want to optimize for I love this model I love this industry these people this whole thing but I want to optimize it for cash you know for margin for cash flow and do it through organic and do it through multiple couple of these and he crushes. Yeah, it's so funny, man, because again, I think I've heard him man say this and I'm I'm I really I really love it, man. I love his take on this stuff, but we do all this [ __ ] to make money, to make net income, to build wealth and get freedom. And we do so much stupid [ __ ] that erodess the net profit and erode and we have big complex annoying businesses. And I think everyone has the day always comes where people look at what they're doing and be like, "What am I doing, man?" You know, there's a simpler, better [ __ ] way. Yeah. No, 100% is. There we go. We got the coffee. We're on brand now. I watched like five of your videos last night just to make sure that I was just to make sure I was on I was on pace. Um, all right. So, what's your what's your like favorite niche or clients? You don't have to, you know, dox names or anything, but because I'm sure you have multiple niches, same I or explain that. So, like all your clients are mainly doing the same business model or like how they do acquisition or whatever, but is it all different niches? Is it Oh, god. dude, the niches are so varied. I we've worked in Bible studies, fitness, golf, ecom, god, basketball, communication, uh hiring, systems building, uh uh dating, uh god, bloody loads, man. Loads of niches, you know. It's uh that's one thing that keeps it fun is it's it's the same model, right? typically just get traffic, put it in a sales process, convert it, provide value, charge high prices so you're nice and profitable. Essentially, it's always the same thing, but the niches and the people uh really keep it interesting. So, loads of niches, man. Loads of different niches. Yeah. Interesting. And then you're so the education or the coaching piece is all kind of is it's specific to the business model you're running right now. So it's how to build what you're currently doing basically. Essentially. Essentially. Yeah. I mean the company is called uh buildgrow andexit.com. And that's exactly what we do. We either help people to build these businesses or grow these businesses or exit these businesses. So it's a pretty [ __ ] appropriate name, you know, for uh for for what we do. It's it's mostly people surprisingly it's mostly people that want to build. It's I I would say it's 60 60% people building for the first time maybe you know the rest is pretty much grow and four people have bought the the exit program. It's very [ __ ] expensive and you know there's not many people that are right for it but uh but yeah that's kind of what it looks like. Yeah, that one that would even be interesting if just your exit model one monetization was instead of uh you know 50 grand or 100 grand whatever number it was percentage that could be interesting if you have you know the XYZ confidence in the business or the XYZ confidence in your team and what they can do to the business like being able to get a chunk of that exit. Yeah, that's probably what I'll do next. I think when when the day comes, I'll probably just actually go in, take equity with a view to exiting and work with way less people. It's a whole different ball game because then you're like, you're getting married to someone for one, two, three bloody years. So, it's such a different play, you know, and honestly, yeah, I'm like, is it worth two to three years of my life to make X when I can do three, four, 500 a month now and it's not that hard, you know? So, I always come back to this. Yeah. It's just it's just I think I've got golden handcuffs right now, you know? It's just so good. Yeah. But maybe it's stopping me going bigger, which is something that's on my mind right now, to be honest. Yeah. Well, it's the trade-off, right? Like you said, I mean, you want a little chaos like you, you know, openly say you want a little bit of you want to enter your stressful era again because you know it's stress. It's just a different lifestyle. Yeah, it is. It's It is fun though when you're getting your hands dirty and there's all the stuff going on and you know it it is very fun. It's I just love these businesses, man. They're like really fun puzzles to figure out and when you figure them out you make loads of money. It's like the best game in the world. Yeah, 100%. What is uh what do you view as the most difficult part or like the most stressful part of that scale? Right. Like if you if you were saying right now, you know, you want to 3X, like what do you see the hierarchy of bottlenecks that occur for you or become the most stressful or painful? Team and paid ads. It's just literally the two things in that last business that led me to hate the business by by the end of it was just the team. And we weren't spending that much. We were spending at our height 6k a day on on ads, but even that to me was was quite stressful, you know, because the more we spend, the less profitable we were, the more headaches, the more you're desperate for your sales team to [ __ ] perform. And the more desperate you are, the harder it is, you know. Again, I'm giving myself [ __ ] PTSD even thinking back to this. But yeah, all you're doing is talking about my everyday right now. So, yeah. Yeah, it's I I would say the team because to I love writing ads. I love writing VSSLs. I love building funnels. I love doing the coaching. I absolutely love the content. Like making videos is probably my number one favorite thing in in the world. I just love it. So, it's just the team. I think having a big team and hiring and firing and managing and ramping and that is the thing that I don't like. I would say, yeah, people ask me questions in like this request box thing and I'll make videos about them and I obviously need some help on that because I have to come up with something every day. But one of the big questions that is is is around that. It's how to find talent. It's managing people. It's whatever, which isn't really an issue until you get to whatever size, you know, call it double digits uh on team. But I made this video that was like this whole walkthrough of like how we find talent for certain things and like where we put them and like the communication channels and the pods and all this. And the very first line item was just like life hack, skip all of this and just hire like a chief of people. And ours was like an organic thing that occurred for us. But we had a coach that then became basically the director of coaches that then became like director of people. Just super high EQ, complete culture fit, a leader in her own right, like all all the things you can imagine. And she is like that everything for us in that in that role. Um, so she's like a ride or die, been here for years now. And yeah, that was a huge life hack for us. Not necessarily on like the management side and structure and ops and whatever. that's more me and in my realm of the project list and the KPI boards and the meeting structure and all that but for finding them for the hard conversations for um comp stuff for like anything in that world and then also just the cultural like glue of it she crushes for us and I you know it's a very hard thing to just say oh go hire one you know go hire a chief of people because it's not your HR admin it's not your normal HR director it's not your whatever like there's a lot of things to it but that was such a life hack for us such a life hack Yeah, I I mean the truth is I need to if I decide to grow this company, I just need to to get better at it, you know, and I need to learn how to kind of put it together properly and get a chief of staff and get put kind of proper things in place. Um I'm a bit embarrassed to to admit this, dude, but like up until a few months ago, we didn't even track anything and we didn't do team meetings either. We we've done about three meetings in honestly I I swear to God 11 months, 12 months, 13 months and I was just like feeding the team calls and just being like do your best to close them, you know, and because they were warm and because they were organic and high trust, they closed them very well obviously and they were talented reps as well because I was lucky to have really good reps to hire. But this has been a bit of period bit of a period of like are we going to sort our [ __ ] out now or not? It's like, yes, we should if if we want to grow, you know. Yeah. Well, you'd rather be sorting it out when you're doing 80% margin, right, than when you're doing 20 and then and then try to do it, right? And try to add stacks. So, that's amazing, though. I mean, I I think your business model is so cool. I think it's uh I think it's it's probably a good fit for mo for most people that come with experience is kind of like the caveat there. not these guys that are just trying to start from nothing to who are selling coaches to co you know coaching to coaches who coach like that whole game or like but if you are someone who has tenure in this space or you have tenure in other spaces I always talk about how that's such a life hack if you're an expert in whatever niche that's outside of internet marketing and can layer in all the internet marketing principles and structure both on fulfillment acquisition just like the consulting model true and true you can crush like ours is in fitness right not in internet marketing world but like there's 92 of them. Like I know the one that does like landscape and snow and does a version of this and crushes. I know somebody who does it in like uh what's the uh knitting like there are ones that crush. Yeah. And just use and use the principles. Dude, 100% man. And in fact, I want to ask you another question. So when you exit, cuz I've got no [ __ ] doubt that that you're going to exit, but when you exit, what are you going to do next? Me? Yeah. Oh man. Um I don't know, man. I got I have a million in one itches that I try and for a long time it it got in my way, right? So, it was like I've bought every course. I've paid every guru. I've looked at every business model. I have a pulse on like everything, right? And like by doing that, I am not the best at anything. And I have never rescaled the agency, but I've bought all the how to build agency courses. I've done all the drop ship or ecom whatever courses and you know messed around done 100 grand in a month and turned it off the next month because you know back to the main thing back to the main thing. Um but I have now allowed myself I just call it interest mapping. I allow myself to do it to where I can like scratch the itch and I can go play in this game knowing that as long as the skill set overlaps with the current main co I allow myself to do it as like a fun side quest. So, example of this, I moved back here was like, "Oh, I'm going to have this taxation, you know, problem more or less now because I didn't have it. Now I do." Uh, cuz I just moved out of PR and uh I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into real estate and start doing all this." And I start getting into these like pockets and like, "Oh, it's interesting to me." And I'm like, "The overlap is just not there enough in current state to justify that for me, right?" Right? Like there's there's other models. There's other ways to do it to achieve the result if it's taxation call it versus me spending I know me and I'm going to crack out and go complete in-depth into something and like I shouldn't be spending the time on that necessarily cuz they just the the skill doesn't overlap. So all to say yes this exits where what's the next model? What's the next scale of things? Um, I see this as multiple years from now. But I see on the way up the time commitment coming down a bit as we get like the machine in place to make it so it could sell. So the team's in place and it's fulfilled on and like it doesn't require 80 hours a week of us or whatever. Um, so dream state is getting it to a place where it's 10 20 you know maybe 10 of actual meetings and then the rest is just thinking about it higher level stuff. we have the network from this and from, you know, the business being big enough that we can hire entrepreneur style talent for like full new divisions if we want to have some big, you know, supplements, let's call it, for example. Um, but yeah, if we get this thing up to those numbers and do exit this, I'm not sure. I don't have a ton of hobbies. I don't have a ton of external stuff. I work too much and not as effective as I could. You know, I'll sit at this desk for 16 hours and could probably do the work in eight. And like I just haven't mastered, like you said earlier, the skill set of being able to do that. I've never built a personal team. No EAS, no nothing. So like I just kind of stack it all on top of each other. I've got the personal YouTube and X stuff. I've got this business. I've got other things. I have, you know, a personal life that's this big right now because of that. And it's just a skill I haven't mastered. So I don't really know what to say the next is, uh, other than just bigger and bigger plays because like my identity is this right now. And maybe that completely sheds and I have to refind that out. But right now it's all work all the time. Uh, dude, I I hear that. I was the same. I am. I am the same. Do Do you want to be a billionaire? Yeah. Arbitrarily. We were talking about this last week, actually. I was like, arbitrarily like, yeah, I I don't view it necessarily. I mean, yes, it's a scoreboard. And I am this big again compared to even my friends, compared to the space. And I feel so weird when I'm like, oh, like you kind of have to do it at some level. It's like, we did 75 million. Like, total cash collected ever. We did 30 last year. Okay, cool. you're in this bracket of businesses, but like I don't know, we have we all know and have the friends that do much much larger numbers. Um, and I like to try and be like, you know, ego and humble around that and much higher profit margins, too. Those are vanity metrics that, you know, the top top is cash collected or revenue technically, right? But like, um, so it's a scoreboard for me, but the big thing is the progression. Like I just said, the skill set like I've identified now the layers of the skill set that I the ones that are right here that I know I can't do. The ones that are out here that I don't even know exist that I don't have. And then like you know the ones I have and I've grown into. Um so it's progression. It's progression in physical fitness. It's progression in life in in my lifestyle. It's progression in bank account. it's progression of the business and what you know I know how to call it make millions and operate in or like you know do this but I don't know how to lead a team of people that make millions and operate in their thing or you know stuff like that thinking like that is kind of where I'm at cuz if I can do that it's just the skill stacking so if that gets to the place where the skills have stacked to the level that I can then be the person that is you know worth a billion dollars or does this for sure but knowing that it is me that I have to progress and work on to even get close to where that direction is. Um, and then yeah, the numbers just arbitrary. It's like where where's the actual number of where you're living that couple hundred million you hear on whoever whatever podcast and stuff. I don't know. I have no personal experience. Yeah. Do do you have like um a number like like a number where if you got to it, you would feel good about stopping kind of thing. I I don't know whether I've described that very well. uh in light in life versus of selling the business in terms of like like wealth like actual liquidity and investments where you're kind of like your set for life number. No, your [ __ ] you number. No, I mean yeah I only know again I only know what I've made my you know my millions. I've spent like an idiot. I have I was, you know, ripping life, let's just say, in, you know, maybe not the most positive way for x amount of time and learned my lessons there and now have a different approach and like what I do with it and where I sit on it and like I hit it hard and did that in my own right. Um, with that being said, I don't, you know, I listen to the My First Million podcast. I listen to like different things in that scope and those are the guys who kind of talk about that, right? The exits, they they talk about the what the true lifestyle or the freedom number is. um to fully live like the most exorbitant exorbitant lifestyle possible. I hear it's like low couple hundreds to be like full-blown to be like to be like jet money and like do all that kind of stuff is like hundreds right um to live very very nice lifestyle is you know I think the Andrew Wilkinson book on uh I love that book by the way or and him he has that similar model of the holding co um but his was he has an equation I think in there but it's like high tens basically very high tens coolurren state, which I'm like, "Okay, it's interesting." Have you ever listened to that um Hampton podcast? Yeah. Yeah. I love that. I watch like every episode. I just I'm fascinated by like investment and wealth and kind of like infrastructure. It's probably the thing that I think the most about is like having a sick kind of bed of wealth, you know? I love that podcast. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I I wish they did it in the style that was my first million cuz I love that podcast and I feel like the style and how they do like the like blurbs in and then like do these little tangents and go off like I don't love the style of it just like random thing but um I think the guests that are on there I think Hampton's a really cool model too um you know it's the it's the next layer of community I I think they're rolling out in person now I heard so good man so good yeah love that it's like a it's a mastermind isn't it for for high net worth individuals Yeah, exactly. And it's I think it's sub 10k a year. My dad's in uh Vistage and has been which is like the really massive version of that. It's like a global one. Um so I've been introduced to Vistage meetings and they basically have a speaker that comes and then it's like half the day is a speaker and then half the day is like your small group and it's in person. So they have cohorts and it's like every six weeks they do this cadence and he's been in it for 20 something years I think. um he does landscaping snow removal but it's uh you know he built a big cultured driven people driven organization and uh it's Hampton's that just on you know online business founder startup that whole game within X bracket so I think it's I think they're cool systems I've never been in anything like that though other than you know the online info people masterminds yeah me me too I've never been in that I've only been to a couple of inerson masterminds I'm always the virtual guy who doesn't want to travel too lazy Yeah, same. Same. Do you have any goals of that being the Cuz right now I don't know who would categorize as like the person. I guess it's probably Iman. Like Iman's having his event in London. We're going to go to that. Like that's kind of it or kind but that's a little more broad. It's more people. Um Welch used to have them that were like the main ones. I guess Kohl's for a while. I think you said you went to Kohl's but his was like the one you go to if you're killing it in info coaching. Yeah. What do you know who um who David Dre is? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was the one who was at uh consulting.com, right? Yeah. He was like Sam Oven's I think is Sam Oven's head of sales back back in the day. So, I partnered with David to do our mastermind. It's called the Dubai Boardroom. So, we do it every six months, 45 people uh in in Dubai for three days. We've done five of them now. Um so, that's that's been really fun to uh to do. And I do the Bali ones as well. Now, the next one is actually next Saturday. It's it's only eight people here at at the the villa, but that's that's very fun. So, I just make people come to me so I I don't have to go to them. It's way better. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. I didn't even know that exists. I now that you say that, I feel like I've seen him make posts or whatever of you guys in like a little old boardroom or something. So, who's in the room for those? It's so broad, man. We have people that are doing 10, 20, 30k a month. People that are doing 300, 500, a million, million, and a half a month. Um we've and we've slowly got bigger every time. We did 10 people, then we 15, then 25, then 30, now 45. We're going to go a bit bigger for the next one next uh next year. So, it's a it's a bit of a mix. It's a bit of a mix. Just taken from me and David's network basically. We just plug it organically and and sell the tickets. Yeah. Yeah. And then what's the format? Is it like the people in the room are up giving their spiel or is it just like round table or It's Yeah, it's not the whole like presentations and stuff like that. It's literally it's pretty much the same as Sam Wven's old mastermind. So day one I get in the room, we go around every person and I ask everyone, "What's your business? How much are you doing a month? What is um the main problem or bottleneck? And what's one thing that's working well for you?" I write it down for every person. And then we basically pick a pick a problem or a bottleneck and get solving it together basically across the weekend. So it's like collaborative which is it's way more fun. It's way better that way man. I don't like the big like presentation stuff. It's just not as not as fun in my opinion. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, we for the longest time like never even went to conferences. And again, I didn't we we almost we looked at Kohl's for a little bit cuz we bought Kohl's uh like middle tier program when we were trying to figure out sales management and trying to figure out the reps. Um but we never went to that event. Um but any event we go to is like a conference where we don't go to any of the actual conference at all and then we end up just hanging out with people outside that are there for the same thing and like do that. But I'm I'm interested to see how Eman's is cuz we're going to that in whatever two weeks in London. Um and I've heard same thing of theirs is like it's very light on terms of presentations and it's just round table hangout. This one's all hosted at one place where like everyone's staying on site. So that's going to be interesting because that's you know 24/7 for 243 I guess you know three days of it but 24 hours a day is around everyone which will be interesting. Yeah that's that's so good man. I think that's going to be really fun. Really fun. that those are the ones I prefer. Just like it's kind of really networking and helping each other, you know, rather than like teaching. It's a better vibe. Yeah. No, no, 100%. Well, cool. I mean, we're running up on an hour 23. You have any other fun, any crazy scale, any crazy story, anything you want to cover? Crazy scale and crazy stories. Well, I can tell. That's I mean generally these are literally just the most ad hoc Oh well I'm sorry. Yeah I would say most of these are just the most ad hoc conversations that are you know getting to know the person random combo. I don't want to be all interviewy or podcasty you know I mean at some level obviously this is just naturally a podcast but um yeah I don't know just like what's working now in the business what are the cool big things? What are the random stories? What are like the in the weeds things that you see? Just you know the fun. Yeah, I mean, dude, for me, YouTube is is is the key driver, you know? I mean, I could talk about some more technical uh tactical bits and bobs, you know, to to book more calls that we do on places like Instagram, but YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Well, for sure. We'll do one thing that got us way way way more calls, and this is people probably know this already, but just in case they don't. So, we just started sending a a selfie video of me to every single follower on on Instagram and then chatting to them, qualifying them, setting them. That got us an extra 70 80 calls a month. So, figuring that out, I actually got um a message from a setter and he basically said to me, "Will I work for Charlie Morgan right now? Charlie is about to fire his setting team. So, I'm looking for a role. if you like, I can just bring in all his systems, all his processes, put it in your business. I had a call with the guy and I was like, "Yeah, let's do it." Came in 80 extra calls a month like immediately. So, that was amazing to to kind of discover that because we weren't doing anything on Instagram. And otherwise, dude, YouTube wise, uh we we've had a bit of a breakthrough recently, right? So, if we go back about a month ago and back, my YouTube videos used to have like a big description. My book was in there, the mastermind was in there, my website was in there, my [ __ ] story was in there, the VSSL link was in there and uh it just got a bit bloated and we were doing well. We were booking a lot of calls. But recently, we deleted everything and just put a link to the VSSL right at the [ __ ] top on its own. And dude, we've taken calls up by I got to look at this live, you know? So that little tactical tweak has taken us from about nine calls a day, 10 calls a day area to like 14, 15, 16 calls. Wow. area that that one change. So that was it's one of those simple things where it's so obvious, but we just hadn't done it. We hadn't tested it and immediately we changed it and straight away we we had way more calls. So that's that's been very impactful. So, those are a couple of like tactical little little bits and bobs. The Instagram selfie video thing and the YouTube description simplicity thing that's been a a game changer. So, yeah. Yeah, I'm funnel I I've got two monitors, so I I'm hearing and looking and funnel hacking you right now. Um, but yeah, I mean, dude, just your YouTube channel alone, just like the view of it, right? all the thumbnails, the titles, how you go about that structure. Like you're clearly crushing it for our niche of the niche. Um, yeah, this is fantastic. And then so they all go here to this build, grow exit, and then it's this long form page where they watch this VSSL on top and then Oh, I was going to say I was like, what is that? It's literally started autoplay. Um, very cool. So then they just book in direct and you've got a calendarly widget that has the questionnaire built in there. Yeah, that's it, dude. Straight to VSSL. Uh there's the whole page with the VSSL at the top. They click through to book a call, go to a Calendarly, fill out the survey, get booked in. Simple as that. And um the team is is really simple right now. Three closers, one setter, a VA, copyright, media buyer. That's it. That's amazing. That's amazing. Um I'm going to pop open X because we you uh got a lot of questions. People uh watch a lot of your content. So, we'll see what some people wanted to answer and then uh we can just riff from there. But okay. Yeah. Uh what uh what business model niche would current would the current you tell 23year-old William to get into? Dude, I would say either learn a high value skill and then teach it through a coaching program or don't learn a high value skill, just partner with someone with a skill. Build them a coaching program, partner with them. Just do info. Like if you want to just rack up cash. Like dude, my my my whole plan is make as much net profit as possible, buy real estate with cash as much as possible. That's that's that's my whole plan. That's been my plan for for eight bloody years, right? That that's all I've ever done. Make cash, buy real estate with cash. And that is what I would suggest to people is start an info business, make cash, buy real estate, and that's it. Yeah, that's I always talk about that too. the there's some young kid that has the Josh Josh is going to laugh when he watches this, but he has a thing called offer publisher that basically teaches people how to do that model. So, it's info or coach or whatever that teaches people how to basically find an expert and build the business model around them and then you own a lot of the time majority and you own all the IP. So, they do it in a way now where you own like the whole brand and the bank accounts and the whatever and the expert is like, you know, on the stack but not the other way around. And I think that's a beautiful model. Wow. Damn, dude. That was a [ __ ] great. So, all right. That's uh that's number Oh, sorry. Our our there's a lag. Didn't mean to interrupt. Um but no, it's it's a cool model. I think that that's basically how our model was created was that similar way. uh I came in again they had done it without me and started without me on that but I know people who are cruising with that that'll own 70% of some IP around some niche and hire in experts to come in and they're on the cap table or the you know profit share whatever thing you want to call it depending uh but they'll do size yeah so good man that is a great model yeah 100% um all right next question are you still skateboarding from time to time. [ __ ] no. I'm [ __ ] 34 years old. You're in Bali, though. They have that bowl. They have that one uh what's that place called? That's over there that everyone goes and uh the bar in the middle and then there's like the whole skating bowl in the back. You got to go. I think you can do it. No, no, dude. Those days are dude, skateboarding, amazing over graffiti, amazing over music was [ __ ] amazing, but I'm glad that's over. Info is the best. info in real estate, man. That's the best. That's fun though. I didn't know. Yeah. I mean, I don't really have a lot of hobbies. So, you you did all those. Those were like passion projects of life. Was that was that during when you were doing that or after? No, it it was one by one. So, like my first ever thing that I really really loved was skateboarding, right? And I did that for a few years when I was young. Off the back of skateboarding, I got into graffiti and I did graffiti for probably three, four years. had the magazine, you know, and eventually got bored of that. Through that, I got into uh music because some of my graffiti friends were like would DJ and then I got into DJing and their music. Started making my own records. Got signed to a pretty good uh record label. Immediately I was touring all over the world, which is super fun, for about five years. But the the money was not very good. You know, some months I'd make four grand, some months I'd make nine grand, some months I'd make $400. So, it was so up and down. It taught me capital management. I'll say that. It really taught me capital management. And then I was looking for another way to make money which led to trading. I I saw a trading documentary on TV, opened a account and and that kind of kicked off. That became the education business. So, I've always just whatever I've loved, I've always made a product out of it, basically. And it's like become a business. That's that's the recurring theme across my life. I've always loved something, made it a business. Love something, made it a business, you know? Yeah. Well, then landing in info and real estate is probably good. They all tie back there. Anyway, u next one we got on here is his LinkedIn strategy. We definitely need to talk about this. Oh, the [ __ ] LinkedIn strategy. Well, dude, it's it's it's really simple. I mean, um I've got the copywriter who writes copy. He also posts it. I think we do one a day now. Uh that shows how professional I am. I don't even know what we [ __ ] do on on a key platform. Don't even know the distribution gate is. I think I think we do one post a day and my setter goes in the inbox, chats to people, sets people. We don't book many calls from it. We only book not many, not many. 10, 15, 20 a month. But that's the strategy. Post content, message people, set them, close them. That's it really. How are you tracking uh kind of technical question but how are you tracking that you know 70% of them come from you know YouTube 20% here just from the form that's on the questionnaire or do you have like a technical backend version of that? It's just Hyros. Yeah, we just have the Hyros tag on. So the LinkedIn setter would have a LinkedIn tag and Instagram would have an Instagram tag. So we just feed it into Hyros. Yeah. So do we. We use Hyros for the journey so we can see it and then we use like a custom setup to feed the pixel because we're doing so much paid ads. But if we weren't doing paid and I would still pay for it just for the journey like being able to click in there. I think they do the best with that. Definitely, mate. Yeah. Have you uh so when you were quick on Becker, I mean you're a longtime Becker consumer, right? Like you've seen his stuff for a while then if you were an iron. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Did you do stuff like before that like any of his ecom journey and that whole piece or was I mean he did a lot of things before that but talk about a guy who just crushed it and just took a hold of what he wanted to do and the person he wanted to be and it's just like his lifestyle now his you know how he continues to be like raw authentic himself and not some you know I mean I guess he is some character but like I think that character is actually him the software play the info play the bigger now software AI stuff the crypto play like what an evolution of a human. Yeah, dude. So inspiring, man. I think um Alex has definitely inspired that part in me of just simplicity, you know, no stupid [ __ ] I've never I've never wasted money. I've never bought a supercar. I've never bought a particularly expensive watch. I've never I've never really wasted money. My dad always like sold the seeds of seeds of doubt in in my head. And ever since I was young, my dad was always like, "Save all your money. Make sure you invest it well. Don't waste it. you know, it could go away tomorrow and he would always say that. So, I think like I took a lot from Becca in terms of just keep it real and just do what you want to do and focus and don't be a knob basically. Um, but yeah, dude, I just found Becca probably 2019 and then I remember I was DJing in London one night. I was in the hotel and I saw a YouTube ad for iron and I booked a call and and bought it a few days later and changed changed my life for sure, man. So, yeah. Interesting. So, that was your like that was the core one that drove this last business was was iron. Oh, dude. By far. Yeah. So up. So I started the last company in 2018 and it and it was just organic until until until I found Becca and we we weren't doing a lot of money. We were doing 30k a month, 40k a month organically. And then I found Becca and dude like I learned what a funnel was. I learned what YouTube ads were. I learned how to write copy. All of that stuff. And that is what got us from 30 40 a month to to [ __ ] hundreds a month is pretty much all thanks to that program. So yeah. Yeah, it was so smart of him to like Trojan horse the I mean he even says they say it on the sales call it's like we don't even care about the money the five grand or the 10 grand or whatever. I think yeah six I think you're actually I think it was actually that. Um and him being like no the whole goal is to get you to a size and show you how much you need Hyros and was getting all of these high ticket like these whales in this thing into Hyros and then it just spread like wildfire. I mean so what an interesting play. So smart man. Yeah. Yeah. He's And then his exit too, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think he sold I know that he I don't think he sold the full thing. I think he did something similar to me where he sold a a big percentage or something. But yeah, nonetheless, amazing. Yeah, I I've heard multiple numbers. I've heard I've had people in my DMs that have said different things like, "Oh, you know, the company that bought it and it was a stock deal and it went to, you know, 99% down." I've heard people say the deal didn't go through, like all this stuff. And it's like, bro, who cares? like he's clearly doing fine. He's clearly doing quite well for himself across his multiple ventures of life and personality. Like what a what a cool business in the space that he's been in forever. And then all the stuff he's done with crypto is hilarious. One and two, clearly very profitable for him. He's just funny, isn't he? He's just like a [ __ ] good guy. He's just funny. Yeah, that's what I mean. He's just so authentically him. At least you know what I think. But like, you know, even in the private groups or the small stuff, like that's how he acts and talks and then he just brought it to the public, right? And like he just has like just stays on that wave. He's a G. He's a [ __ ] G. He He's a G. He's an absolute G. Uh, what else we got in these questions? Um, how does he Oh, here we go. How does he look at exiting info business and should you even try to optimize for it? So, this is kind of how to I guess reframing this. What is the curriculum or approach that you use for that back-end product for the exit portion? Yeah. Right. Well, to answer that question, I may or may not sell or try to sell this company in the future. Right now, it's like very unsellable. Well, let me tell you how I would sell it, right? Because that will probably show how I think about the exit process, right? So if I wanted to sell this company, firstly I would decide on a number that I wanted to sell for. So I've got a goal and a target, right? Let's just say let's just say 10 million, right? So I want to sell this for 10 million. Well, like my last company was, it will probably be seen as a media business and valued at around 2 and a half to 4x. So let's say we're going to sell for 4x for for example. So I want 10 million. So I'd need to be doing about 2 and a half million a year ebidar. Two and a half times four is gets me to 10 million. So right well now we need to get to two and a half ebidar. And then obviously we need to start thinking about removing keyman risk uh hedging out the organic or bringing in other personalities with their own organic to feed it into the brand. We need to have very clean organized financials. We need to have a goodlooking solid track record. We need to have a good story as to why would someone why would someone want to buy us? Like what could they do next? Where could they take it? Is it a financial buyer that they're buying for the money? Is it a strategic buyer they're buying to do something with it? And just start getting to where you want to be ebidar wise thinking about who you want to sell to and getting the business in a salailable position. And uh I think that you should sell your company because it's either sell it or put it in the bin and it's either just turn it off and have nothing or at least sell it and get some [ __ ] money to walk away with, you know, because I think you'd be stupid to to just turn it off. So I think that's what I would do and that's what I think people should do. Yeah. My dad's always said like again landscape and snow, but his or you talk Sorry. Oh, there you go. I was the the lag is hilarious. I apologize if I'm interrupting. Um, but the my dad always says he has a mentor that said this. It was like, you know, you either exit the business, you sell it, or you exit it in your boots, right? And that's what a lot of these guys do. That's what 99% of businesses do, right? Is they go out in a stretcher, right? And it's they it just goes onto the airs, it closes down at whatever. Like you you just die in your boots. And that is just like a terrifying thought that both in lifestyle of like you never actually did the thing you were building for the whatever that is the freedom the number the whatever and you just never made it or you got into a position where yeah it's just that's it's just a very interesting frame to think about if you don't cash flow heavy on the way up and actually continue to live your life throughout it and you just never hit it. Then you optimize and you optimize and you try and you're going for some goal that you essentially never hit in your life which is crazy. Definitely. I think like you should prioritize net profit, build a bed of wealth so that even if you don't sell, you're still good. I think box number one that you need to tick is just get yourself solid. Save up a good amount of cash, a million, two million cash. Buy a home with cash so at least you're solid. You've got a you've got a home paid off. You're good. You know, that's like level one to me. And then if you don't sell, that's okay. If you do sell, even [ __ ] better. you've got more cash to to invest. That's kind of that was my playbook essentially. Yeah. I got to ask. So for your Bali set situation, those are like hundredyear leases, right? No. No. 30 years. 30-year leases. So you buy So you get 30-year the So you pay your million bucks and you get it for 30 years. And what happens in 30 years? I never understood this. Yeah. So my So this place was 900,000 US for 30 years and a h 100,000 for an extra 30 years. So I got a million literally a million cash for 60 years. Oh wow, that's so interesting. Yeah, that's so interesting. Like what happens in 60 years? Well, I mean I guess nobody knows, but like how has it happened? Have they done this for 60 years already or 30 years where you've seen what happens on the reup? Dude, give me two seconds to have a wait. I'm [ __ ] dying for a week. I can't concentrate. L literally give me 10 seconds. All right. And and I'll be back. Just two minutes. Okay. We'll just sit here and just me and the audience will sit here and stare at each other. [Laughter] That's why I like these conversations. They're raw. They're authentic. What's up, guys? Just you and me right now. If you're still here, we're at what? I got to open this up. We are rocking an hour and 42. So, comment 1.5, which is not true for anything, but just comment 1.5 if you're still here. And we're just still jamming about random [ __ ] dude. I was dying for a [ __ ] piss. Need that so bad. All right, that's my bad. No, I was Yeah, I was just talking one to one. I was like, "Comment 1.5, if you're still here right now, this might have to be the first one I edit where I edit a clip or I might just leave I honestly might just leave it raw." dead silence for like 20 seconds just just for the keep it keep on brand. We we both make raw YouTube videos. Believe it. This is raw. This is raw. This this is what it's called. This is real. This is real life. Just two dudes jamming 12 hours apart. Exactly. But anyway, um yeah, so my landlord actually lives in the little village behind the house. And when I bought it, they said to me, Indonesians like they don't want to inflate their lifestyle. So they would never need the land back cuz what they going to do with a mansion? you don't even want one. Uh so you can probably just keep buying 30 years, 30 years, 30 years. The price will go up. So that 100k for 30 years now might be, I don't know, quarter of a million for 30 years later. But dude, I'm 34. The 60-year lease takes me up to 94 years old, you know. Probably going to be done by then, you know. Yeah, that's a fair that's a fair expectation. Um cool. Yeah, I mean I see all those guys do it. I don't know. the time zones for me. That's the other piece of like the freedom aspect is um me and my buddies have always talked about oh let's go do three months in Gold Coast or let's go do this or that and it's like I've always been like oh when the cash flow is X and when the lifestyle more so when I don't have these like meetings and that's what I do I operate the meetings right I operate the main cadence the that stuff so I would live this completely like dual lifestyle where I'm midnight basically taking calls or doing stuff and it's like that's not a freedom life either um so how big does this have to get or how operationally you know, machine to where we're not doing those and it's more checking in. You know, the um yeah, just that kind of style of things you hear about the guys like Tony or um I'm blanking right now, but uh you know that run 50 companies and have all these CEOs everywhere and bounce around and live like this whole life, but then that happens. I don't know, just not even there and skill set wise to get there. I I I hear that. For me, I think if I still had like a bigger business, a bigger team, a bigger operation, I might not have been able to move here because of the the timeline. So, the the time zone, but right now, people do calls kind of on my like I I I get to choose, you know, so they kind of just have to do the calls. But it's pretty good. The time zone's pretty good, actually. Yeah, I think this time zone's better than Dubai because you can get up early, take calls at 8, that kind of thing, and you're still hitting us. That' be 8:00 p.m. for you guys. So, yeah, it's not too bad at all. It's not too bad at all. And it's worth it to be here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of those people, everyone. I'm fitting Williams time zones and getting up at 4 or getting up at 3:00 a.m. to do calls and it works. So, lifestyle by design, baby. Uh, but no, I love it. I and I also think that because I'm like a 4:00 a.m. 5 a.m. kind of naturally but not usually these like I'll build during these times. So on that time zone it does work well for end of EST or those PST people right where it's 1 to 5:00 p.m. and for you it's you know 3 4 5 a.m. that would be good for me but then you live that lifestyle of you're in bed by 8 or 9:00 p.m. Uh which is actually kind of how I live right now but like yeah just the time zone thing has always been difficult. Our team is majority on North America is like North American time zones. Um we have some media buyers and stuff that are in Europe but they make all the team meetings that we have or the you know one or two a week that we have and optimize for our schedule. So kind of similar but again all around North America. So you go anywhere outside of that and it's like this London trip I'm like am I going to be okay? Like that's crazy that like I don't have the freedom level of an eight hour time difference or whatever it is to be like what happens to my meeting schedule or like what if there's a fire? Like I just haven't gotten there. You're in the weeds. You're in the weeds. I'm in the weeds for Yeah, dude. I am in so hard in the weeds right now. Like everyone's going to torch me in the comments because like you talk too much or this is about William, not you. And this is a conversation I like to have versus an interview style. But my my life right now is 16 hours a day at this desk and doing eight hours of what could be work. Like it's so scattered. It's the YouTube and X every single day. It's the checking Slack every 12 minutes. It's the all the team and then we're ramping a CMO. So, you know how that is, right? Like hours a day of in that world. We checked that box and now we did the same thing with sales and now I'm about to do the same thing with data, tech, and fulfillment because I'm trying to build it to where I have a sea level that I work with. Not I'm in the weeds of everyone's stuff and like I see the other side. I see the the you know the light at the end of the tunnel, but in current state, oh my gosh, I have no personal life whatsoever right now. Yeah. It it makes me think cuz dude, good god, I was there as well. I would just get up and work all [ __ ] day, seven days a week for years, for [ __ ] years. You know, and it makes me think either was that just a season and I've got it out of the way now and this is my next season and maybe I'll go back into that season later or was I doing it wrong? Is there a way to do it without working the hours under the sun and with more balance? If there is, I don't know it and I'd like to know it. I think I think you've either got to be all in like you or kind of be all out like me right now. I don't think there's a middle ground really. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. No, I I you see it right where there are people but like to get the result right is I think really those two options like if if the goal is what the goal is, right? And and yours is very clear and you are hitting it, right? Um, and then ours is clear and we're almost not hitting it with all the effort and the work and the team and stuff. We haven't hit it yet, but like when we do, it's like, okay, now we live in this new land of can we truly go two weeks, you know, I heard a hormone thing talking about how they go on like two week fake vacations basically and pressure test the company and they'll go, you know, two weeks without respond. I don't know, you know, what the actuals are and this is me putting words in people's mouths. So, but like are they not answering anything? Are they only answering by email but not solving anything? are that you know once a day I don't know what it actually looks like but talk about a way to pressure test on like does the company grow does it maintain are there fires that only you're able to put out now you need to hire for that does the P&L support that where you can hire for those positions or is it not big enough yet like yeah do well do I did that myself during our acquisition for I think the first time ever I went to Thailand with my girlfriend for two weeks and I was like right guys I'm not going I'm going to try my hardest to not look at Slack. I'm not going to look at High Roll or the calendar. I'm not going to be on any of the meetings and let's just see what happens. And we had one of our best twoe periods that that we'd ever had. So I was like, hm, it does it does run without me, you know, and it actually does better without me. Yeah. Being in the [ __ ] weeds, you know, shouting at everybody all the time. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing that we have is there's like three I don't like talk about like the net numbers and all of that. Like I talk about grow like you know roughly and like what a healthy margin is and stuff like that and talk rough but we have business partners so I don't really want to like doc you know they didn't choose to come out and say what their uh what their incomes are and stuff like that. So I don't think it's fair or like what the cap table is. But um the beauty and the demise version of having partners like that is like obviously you're splitting the pie which is so real. So, you know, say, let's just say it's thirds. Let's just say, uh, you know, you need to do three times the amount to make the same amount, which is a whole another thing to add to this is, you know, your 100k in profit is not 100K in profit. Let's say it's 33 33 like ish, let's just say. Um, that's a whole another thing of like how much size do you need? But the and the beauty of that though has been in the past there is some overlap on if these people are out or like one you know owner co-founder whatever is out the other people can kind of pick up the slack or there's always some level of leadership in there but talk about overlap in a negative way of where you kind of have similar skill sets or you kind of do the same thing the uh splitting of the you know profits and the and the cash of the company and then the it's just kind of difficult because it's like once you get to a certain in size is are all you know you can't have founder risk at all. So it's like all three of you are out and for us it was marketing and sales basically with one of the co-founders. He's very like he's very very much like us like we're like thickest thieves. Um so he's like the internet marketing version guy. He leaned into all marketing and sales. He was the one spending and doing the media buying up to like 20k a day like all of that world and then has now built out a team. Sales very similar. Um the other co-founder was like product face the expert right? So differentiation there and then mine was like tech systems and now more so like ops right because that just scales to being people what was once automations tech and like framework. Um and to this day I do all the marketing tech. So like I am the the lynch pin of that port or like the just break point of oh we want reporting around this or we're going to launch you know these three new VSSL funnels. I'm getting looms yesterday of like hey we need custom like how are we going to track this and I got to do all the HubSpot setup. So yesterday was the first day ever that I've done this, but I hired a a marketing tech yesterday that came from XYZ company that we can talk about offline, but has direct experience the entire software stack, the entire thing. And like that may be my unlock that I've been missing for two years or three years since I've been trying to like lean into doing this one and still holding my little tech zone. So it'll be interesting to see. Yeah, dude. I was just about to ask you that. I was just about to ask like when are you going to hedge yourself out and think about bringing someone in and then you just you answered it. You beat me to it. But have you ever heard of a guy called Wes Watson? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot that I don't really kind of, you know, believe in about what Wes kind of says and and does as such. I've never met him. I don't I don't really know him. But a little while ago, I saw him say something like, you know, if you can do it, just just do it yourself. And I think there's a time and the place for that to be true or not. I think in your case that's not true. I think in my case that is true. But for me, I think you should go, it just depends what profit margin you want. It just depends what [ __ ] profit margin you want. Yeah. And how much work you want to do, you know? That's what it comes down to. And there's no such thing as a a good or a bad margin, you know? like you you've had people on the channel that are doing sick, you know, 1 2 3 mil a month. I don't actually don't know what their margin is, but it's like it's just it's just what you want. And I'm I'm a big believer, build the business how you [ __ ] want it and don't don't let it run away from you. Don't let it become a Frankenstein like I did with my last company because I ended up with a business that controlled me. Yeah. Instead of me controlling it, it wasn't nice. Yeah. No, I I completely agree. And like the that's that constant game is like how much do you want to how much do you want to sacrifice of profit? Like the West model, right? It's like do it yourself. And like he's just a workhorse. Like that guy is an animal, right? He crushed I saw him speak at uh um Josh Snow has a mastermind or used to have a mastermind and we went to a couple of things and he had him come there and speak and he's just so intense. Like his numbers are crazy, right? He does like the most unconventional. They do, you know, DMs for high ticket basically and he'll just, you know, fire off a stripe link. He's like, I answer all the DMs like who needs setters. Like he's he's he's intense. Um he's intense, but yeah, it's lifestyle, right? Like he wants to and and lives that lifestyle kind of naturally. Um clearly, but yeah, that that's an interesting one. Um next question on here is a fun one. The is life as exciting after after the exit? Is life exciting? Yes, it is. Yes, it is in in in a different way. Right. So, when I was building that business, the excitement was can we build it? Can we grow it? Can we scale it? Can we sell it? How big can we take it? So, it was the it was exciting to learn it all and and do it all and discover it all. Right. And now the exciting part is having the control that I didn't used to have because when I was building that business especially towards the start I mean I I founded it from my mom's spare room and I had I was broke as [ __ ] you know so it was yeah a lot of importance on getting capital for freedom and choice and now I've got a lot of capital and freedom and choice. So the exciting thing now is I can do what the [ __ ] I want. You know, if I want to scale, I can scale. If I don't want to scale, I can not scale. If I want to hire, I can hire amazing people. If I want to run ads, I've got loads of money to put into ads. So now the excitement is is control and freedom and a bit more maneuverability now. So equally as exciting, just different types of exciting. Yeah, I respect so much. I feel like if you hot hot keyworded this entire transcript, it's like the amount of time you talk about the choosing the goal, identifying it for yourself, freedom, lifestyle by design. Like I feel like you've really like nailed that, right? And like that you're just like a living execution of that. And that's like that's cool to me that that's what your real goal is it sounds like and you're just and you're hitting it over and over again. and it changes and the seasons and like the goal does shift, but hit it, move to the next one, take some time to sit, reflect, get a Bali Villa, pick the next one, build it again. Like it's just this game of like iteration, which I respect. I think that's cool. I appreciate that, brother. Thank you. Yeah, 100%. All right, last tactical one and then we're already at two hours, which is hilarious. Uh YouTube long form tips for someone who wants to sell a product. I can ask this selfishly as well. I don't want to sell anything, but like I'm leaving so much meat on the bone. Um, and a lot of people are. There's a lot of the pros out there who are willing to, you know, everyone in their everyone is selling the personal branding, the how-to content stuff. Iman led this charge and now everyone sells it. Um, so what are your what are your tips for specifically your style? Like how have you approached your your content machine? Yeah, for sure. Well, God, there's there's a lot there's a lot to talk about, but I'll just give you some nuggets. So, one thing that's very important to me is the is the background and the setting of the the video because that like subconsciously communicates well communicates things so you can kind of pick what you want it to communicate. So, I always I almost kind of design a set for for the background of my office. You know, Dubai was the skyline, the 10 mill, the bookshelf and stuff like that. here. It's like the rice field view and stuff and it I just like the background to look clean and professional like you've actually put effort into it. So, that's one thing that's important to me. Um, another thing is just to keep it as real as possible in the videos. If you stumble, leave it in. If you mess up a word, leave it in, right? And if you can, don't script it and don't have bullet points. For me, I just I put 80% of my effort into the title. So the title always comes first for me. When I've got a title, then it I just start making a script in my head of like what I want to say. I just leave it in my head for a few days to start just coming together and then I hit record, talk, stop, upload, and just keep it as real as possible. There are occasions where I reshoot if I really lose my path and and mess it up, but it's pretty damn rare. So number one, setting. Number two, just keep it real and uh keep it raw. And number three, like just the the title carries a lot of weight for me. And if there's one thing that I've learned, right, it's all in the idea. If you have a great vid idea, a unique, one of my buddies uh who has a massive YouTube channel, he he called it remarkable. If your video is remarkable, like I sold my company to a private equity firm for millions and it's a remarkable video, you will win. You will get [ __ ] tons of views and traction. Yeah. So, just try and think of the most unique, remarkable titles and ideas possible. And if you do those three things, you're pretty far ahead to be honest. And and also like we were talking about earlier on the tactical side, for God's sakes, put your [ __ ] VSSL at the top of the description and make sure it's obvious where people should go, right? As obvious as that sounds, a lot of people don't do that, you know, stuff like that. Yeah. No, 100%. Yeah. I'm not optimizing any of that, right? Like the the one thing that people keep telling me if there was like the 8020 or the one the 991 is the packaging of these things which is what you just said right like the title and the like the big idea. What's the big idea and nailing that dude? What one other thing that I will say as well is basically don't have a thumbnail, right? just have the simplest, cleanest, most ambiguous thumbnail that you can because then all attention goes on the title. So instead of trying to make a great title thumbnail combination, one thing that's worked best for me is having a blank thumbnail that doesn't really tell you anything about the video because then people have to look at the title to find out what it's about. And then if you're good at titles, that is a big edge. So that's one thing that's that's worked for me in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. And obviously it's going to be different for, you know, entertainment or it's going to be different for this niche or the how to like that. But I am existing, you know, exactly within yours is super helpful for me. I a lot of people told me that they were like, "Hey, just make them super raw. Do a screenshot cuz I do everything on Miro cuz I do need the I need the bullets in order to keep me on track or I'll just tangent." And like sometimes they're great and sometimes they're not. And I don't want to have to, you know, I'm a one take kind of guy too. Like it takes me 30 tries to get through the beginning and then to like re-record to like try and nail that beginning and like here's what we're going to talk about and then once I break through one time it's like cool I can go for 20 minutes or 40 minutes cuz then it's raw. I don't care if there's little blips and stuff. But I just feel like the important the intro is so important and I even do a terrible job of my intro. It's like title quick here's what we're going to cover and then I do like the social proof like you know we did 30 million last year we've done 75 in total. I'm not selling you anything. Whatever. It like takes too long. It's just choppy. But trying to do them every day has been very difficult for me to keep within a small time frame. Yeah. I You know what? So, one thing, one thing I thought way back in the day when I was starting this channel, I I remember thinking, what video would I love to watch and I thought, man, I would love it if Sam Ovenans just sat there and told me lessons without any plan or editing. I thought, wow, that'd be amazing. What Alex Becker doing the same thing, Cole Gordon, whoever. So I thought, well, if that's what I would want, well, let me just try and give that to my audience and see if they want it because, you know, if I want it, there's probably other people who do. And that's been very true. You know, a lot of people have said to me, man, like, I just like how you just tell us stuff in a very real, chilled out way, you know, the same for you as well, you know. Yeah. No, I mean, your stuff's great. like I just found that section that's like what other channels do people watch and I kind of clicked through them and I had already watched you know a handful of your videos. Um but I binged and I I don't know. I love the style. Obviously I do this style. It's what I like to consume and you got to assume that the person that watches it is someone who's similar to us who doesn't want the crazy editing and the flashy this and that and the pre, you know, pre-recorded stuff. I try and watch them every once in a while cuz I'm like, "Oh, that's like a great title." Or like, "Oh, that would be so interesting." And I get so lost in like the I don't know. I like can't do that style of of consumption even when it's like all flashy. I'll throw them on 2.5x or try and skip around to just like the tactical portion just for how I operate. Um so I think we serve a niche of people that that do it is interesting to me like the watch time and I'd be like I don't know where yours sits but I do ramble a bit. I do kind of go in these directions as we're doing here, but like there's people that I just threw on there like, oh, 1.5, you know, comment 1.5. And the amount of people that watch full through is very interesting to me. But the blended number is very low. It's 7 minutes, it's 12 minutes, it's whatever. And most my videos are say 20. So it's sub 50% which is like not good, right? The retention is my is not fantastic. But the people that do consume and having the ability for people to consume if they want to, I think is like a pretty cool moat of like where someone can get to know you, can understand how you think, like you said. Um cuz there's plenty of people. Jackie Chow is a great example. He does like a build in public thing. He's a big SEO guy and he does like a daily video. And when I came upon his stuff, I literally clicked on the playlist and flipped it on its head so I could start in the beginning and watched like I don't even I was in Puerto Rico and bored and whatever and was working. threw it up on this screen and I seriously had to have watched tens of hours over a couple days of just every video in a row and just got to think about like how he sees things and all that. Dude, I did that with your channel as well when I first found it. I went on I went to the oldest first and just started watching every single one in order. You know, I was doing that last night as well. I was having a cigar outside and I picked up where I left off and just watched like seven in in a row. Um, and I think people like us generally will watch the entire thing, even if it takes a little while. But for me, for my channel, all I look at is views and booked calls. I don't look at click-through rate. I don't look at watch time. I'm just like, how many views? How many calls? That's that's all I care about. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, that's the result. That's the goal you're going for, right? Do you do anything within the videos? I mean, I kind of already know the answer, but for everyone who hasn't. Uh, do you do anything in the videos to kind of frame for that call like your CTAs and all that, just for anyone who's listening? Dude, most of the time I forget to do it, you know? I just I Yeah, most of the time I don't do it. Sometimes I do if I remember, but I I almost don't want to give people a call to action. I want people to choose to go looking for a call to action because then the intent is so much better, you know? Yeah. No, I agree. Um cuz I mean I watched some of them and some are some are kind of there but yeah majority of it's just like good quality content that then you know people are drawn to do it. Um, I think the hormosi model of that and how like they definitely optimize, right? They have that example where it's like the links are right there. They do the comment with the pinned one. Like they do they optimize for the click, but he layers in some CTAs, but they do such a good job of doing it as like the true lowhanging fruit, the book, the whatever free courses. Like talk about talk about value the courses that are on their site. I don't know if you've ever gone through those like the scale, the leads. He has full courses that basically go along with the books that he's created that are on his site that are tens of hours. Like, you know, something someone would charge 10 grand for. Yeah. Onacquisition.com. It's like the learn whatever. Actually, I have it open right now. Wow. Yeah. They have a thing on top of their site called courses. It's scaling offers and leads. And you click on scaling. It's like 16 hours or something. Offers one is the entire book. Um leads is Yeah. So, it's cool. But he pushes those in the in the comments a lot and anyone who consumes that is going to like his model of if you're a beginner and go to school and if you're more advanced or building go into here and now having all the workshop and education layers and then the back end being oh we're going to own a portion of your company either buying it or just you know receiving it is so cool to me. Yeah, dude. It's if if you can do that that is the best model you're doing that right now. You're giving mad value away for free. you will be doing this for a very long time. You might put out some free courses and stuff as well and then eventually you're just going to have immense deal flow and you can just be very picky about consulting. You can be very picky about you might partner with people. So it's a it's it's a it's a great play. It's a great play. Yeah. Yeah. The I mean the true goal of this entire thing was the network more than anything. It was like, you know, in the cave for however many years and like didn't leave the apartment, let alone leave the virtual apartment and like go, you know, try and meet like friends or network or whatever you want to call it online at all. Nothing on Instagram, no X, obviously no Z uh YouTube. Um, and it's been astounding to me the level of quality, the positive feedback loop. Like, it's crazy that I did not do this earlier. Um, I'm kind of glad I didn't because it obviously allowed me to kind of come into it with enough that at least I think is a little bit valuable to share and like spew from my brain. Um, cuz all I've done is consume for 10 years. All I've done is just be a consump and like you know obviously implemented it and have some experience and a little bit of skill around it. Um, but a majority of what it's been is just like regurgitated or you know consumption based stuff and now it's the complete opposite. It's like I feel like I'm like I hate it at some level where it's like I'm no longer I don't feel as much student. I like the teaching aspect cuz you have to like simplify it and think of it in a good way in order to explain it or teach it. I think there's huge value in that. But the lack of consumption I have now and just spewing and like I don't know. I feel like it can kind of come off as like I know everything or like this ego play and that's the last thing I want. So that's why I try and share like the L's and like the what's hard now and what's happening. Um but yeah, I don't know. It's like that dance. I feel like I definitely agree with that. I try and, you know, like I did with you earlier. I was trying to admit some of the stupid [ __ ] that I've done to just show people like I'm not I'm not not some crazy god guy. I'm just a random idiot who's learned a few things and done it for a while, you know? So, it's funny. Yeah. Yeah. All right, we're coming up on two or we're over two now. anything you want to leave everyone with or any other final topics you want to cover? I think we've covered a lot. Yeah, we've we we've ran for a while actually. I think we've covered a lot. Yeah, it's been fun. We've seen the sun go down in your in your background, so uh we we've we've probably hit about our time. My sun's coming up right now, actually. So, it's perfect. So good, man. So good. Yeah. No, it's been fun. Hope Cool, man. Yeah. No, it's been fantastic. I definitely want to stay in touch. What is actually last question on this? Who is like your ideal like right now ICP? I mean I know you have multiple offerings and everything low ticket which is probably more beginnery or you know actually probably not because someone who's building and scaling but um yeah who's the ICP? Yeah I mean the ideal ICP is someone who's already going but they're small. There's a lot that they don't know. There's a lot that they need help with. Like I can double, triple, quadruple those people's businesses so [ __ ] fast. So, if there's someone watching this and you're at 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, 40, 50ish range, dude, I can grow the hell out of your business. So, that's the the ideal, but honestly, we can work with anyone, you know, anyone that has a skill, a talent, specialist knowledge that they want to package up and sell at a high level, high profit level, you know, kind of like I'm doing is is a perfect fit, I would say. Interesting. Yeah. I I wouldn't imagine that it was that that uh like low of a threshold, but it completely makes sense. The ability to two, three, four. Yeah. So, all right. Well, anybody there's tons of people who watch this, I'm sure, that have that. So, William actually sells things and gets people results. So, go check it out. Uh I just spew. So, you guys rock. I appreciate you. Let's definitely stay in touch. Let's do uh I want to do an update on this in x amount of months or whatever as this evolves. maybe even, you know, a year down the road when we get in a position where we're on the exit side of things or not or we completely change the model and go back to being, hey, this is going to be a big cash cow like we thought it was going to be forever up until 6 months ago. So, things change quickly. Let's see. Let's see. We'll revisit this later. We will. All right. You guys know where to find him. Search his name. He's on X. He's on YouTube crushing. So, I will talk to you all tomorrow. What's today? The 31st. So, tomorrow I'll do the month in review video and have some fun updates on where we hit last month. So talk to you guys soon.
