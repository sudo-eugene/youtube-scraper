In today's video, I'm going to share how we lost $1,164,029 on a bad partnership. I'm going to share why we got in the partnership in the first place, why we kept it going when it was bleeding, the money in money out exact accounting, the funnel and where it was breaking down, and our plan going forward with this partnership and partnerships alike. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. And I share everything on this channel, no BS, no fluff, to show what failed, what worked, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, why we even did this. This entire thing was LTV focused. All right, so to add value to the customer and to increase the customer experience. So like I said, women's fitness business that right now all we sell is a $7,200 a year annual coaching program. So, the only way that we make more money is them to renew and buy more. Okay? And Hormosi has a ton of really good videos about this. Um, but basically with the focus on LTV, you can have other things you sell them, right? Is the simplest way to say this. It's either sell them more or you sell them other things. Okay? Now, for us, we didn't want to do the focus on starting up a supplement company from scratch and doing that on the side as a second business or inside of this business. And we didn't want to lose the focus on the main business. So, like I said, Hormosi videos are really good about this if you want to look at at deeper into this, but finding a solid partnership where another company has your ideal customer profile um as the exact same and they want they will buy the same things is huge. So, we found a company that does supplements and like testing kits. So, essentially the customer gets sent a test kit in the mail. They do swabs and stuff like that. send the test kit back, gets all the results, get on the phone with somebody from the company to review the results and then give recommendations to supplements that are essentially the core ones that like everyone should be taking for health and then the customized and personalized stuff based on their levels of different things. Okay, so for us, the goal of this was to do it for every single purchaser that came through on the back end to increase that customer experience, add the value to have the nutrition and like health side of it covered more, but not start our own supplement company. So, initially we had, I believe, 25 to 30% as commissions and we got it up to 40%. The money in money out is where it breaks. Um, but essentially we were buying a test kit for every single customer that came in. So, someone would get on a sales call with us, they would join our program, they'd pay us 7,200 and from that 7,200, we would pay 275 to 350ish uh for a test kit for that person instantly. So, we would take everything from the terms, we would send it over to the other company, they would process it and send a test kit to them by mail. Okay. So, in 2024 alone, I pulled this from QuickBooks, we spent 1,258,19,452, if that's how you say that. Um, but we spent like 1.2. We did we spent 1.25 million on test kits alone. Okay, that's our only direct expense. 2024 earned from this in the commissions from the actual sales 83,000ish and this year to date 11,234. Okay. Now to be clear this number is going to consistently go up but not that much. Okay. So like next month we'll maybe make another two three four grand. The next month we'll make you know two three grand. The next month we'll make one two whatever that is because this is a recurring thing. So that's why we initially got into this because we said, "Okay, we don't want to start our own supplement company. We want to find somebody that aligns with our values and missions." And as a side point, none of this is to say that their company is bad, the products are bad, the business is bad, anything. Nor is it to say ours is. It's the the combination and how we handled the partnership and how the math backed out where it just wasn't a good deal for both parties. Well, I mean, it's probably really good for them because they made 1.2 on us, but we it the the value exchange was not there for this to be a good partnership into the future. Okay. So, we only made 83K last year on 1.2 in and that is a breakdown of 40% of the purchases. Okay? And I'll go through the math on the funnel right here. But all of this to say, if we would have done this in-house, it would have been a giant shift in focus, but doing it out of house and not having the numbers dialed and control over the funnel and where the things break down was a huge issue. Okay, so funnel breakdown. I'm actually going to go down here to start. So, like I said, right now someone would buy our we're calling this our backend purchase. So, our high ticket program 7200, the terms would happen. They would go into our system and begin our program. But for the funnel that is specific to the partnership, the kit would be sent to them. They would complete the registration, which basically means that they would send the kit back, right? They would sign up for an account online. They would uh register the kit and they would send it back. Then they would attend the call once they get the results in and then they would purchase a product. Okay? So now across these on this testing window and what all this data is based on is 3,91 kits. Okay. So I have like a full sheet on all this and this was six months ago or so now um that this data was from. So to be clear that's when this entire data window is um 3,91 were sent a test kit. Meaning we had 3,91 high ticket purchasers that came into our company that we then sent a test kit and just bump 250 30 350 whatever the number was that we paid on the kit. Okay. of those that came back and sent their kit back only 53% did. Okay, so first funnel breakdown issue that is both on us that is on the expectations and that is on that company. Okay, because we're sending the kit and just passing off the customer clearly did not work right. So where can we be in control of that? Our coaches, our back and forth, our our communication, hey, make sure you send your kit. It's like integral for you to start. It's, you know, including your onboard. It's a requirement. We did do a better job of this. And back to why I said like why we kept going when we knew it was bleeding because it was getting better. It just never backed out. But like it was worse than this and then it got better than this. And like we kept trying to do that. But in the end, the math overall didn't work. But we started to put in things in place like in our road map and onboarding flow that you needed to register your kit and all the benefits and uh why you need to get all those answers. But still only 53%. So on my numbers here, if 1.2 2 million was spent and 50 of them even registered the kit. We just burned 600 G's before we even started, right? Like not good. Um, so 600 grand just out just on that alone. The next how many once sending back the kit got on the call? 70%. Better still not great. It's like you just took the time to swab and do all the things but and sent your test kit back but then you didn't get on the call with the actual rep. Now this was business issues too. like there was not call availability. Calls would get bumped. Uh new reps were getting onboarded because we were pushing in so many to their business like that it didn't make it wasn't optimal. It wasn't optimized for their inside their business. Um so 70% got on a phone call and then of that unique about 400 purchase. So then 24% from here. So the breakdown here 50% issue here in communication requirements that's on us that's on them. How many attended the call after the kit was in there? Again, we can take some responsibility for that. They can as well. And then purchase. This is what happens on that phone call. This one, yes, we kind of can as well, but that's like them and their conversion rates and how they close. So, like I said, kits, registration, call completion, purchase, AOV, $140 on a purchase. Okay, so these are recurring buys and that was why we were like, "Oh, the math might back out into the future." Is this like phantom LTV and MR number that we based everything on and it was wrong and that's why I'm like so keen on uh data. And even if the AOV is 140, we're only making 40% of that or whatever. So call it 56 bucks, which I don't even know. Is that right? Close to right. 74. Yeah, that's right. So commission on average being $56 of these purchasers. So like to catch up to what we're paying in 350 or 300 to for the test kit was a big jump that we just never got to. So what's the plan going forward? So all of this is really and more so plan going forward is like what LTV boosters exist is probably a better way to say this. So for us the main focus right now is retention. So we have an entire retention team around this and just doing the more of the same model in current form. Okay. So once someone's 60 days out from their renewal, we schedule a call with them with a dedicated retention team that are actually old sales pod leaders. So like um uh they basically had 10 to 15 sales uh team members under them in management and also being a top sales rep. So those two have now left over there and gone to the back end of the company to do retention. So selling more of the same. All we're selling is the exact same annual coaching program just for 1K off. Okay. So instead of uh 7200 it's 6200 and they push that. What we're building out now is this downell and contin continuity. So building out an offer that is a downell in a way because it'll be less dollars um but will be continuous uh continuity and will just highlight the points of why they want to stay. So a lot of people stay for community. They stay for continued accountability. Do they stay for the personalization? Like there's all the different pieces of the current offer that can be stripped down to why does someone actually stay once they get past that first year of education, uh, understanding, progress, results, all that. So, that's what we're building out right now and it exists. Okay. Other ways that I've seen and heard people talk about and what has been recommended to us, sell your data. Like, no, we don't do that. We're not a fan of that. Um, a lot of people will take in, so like right now we'll run 30 G's a day to a VSSL callunnel that will have name and email that is the opt-in. I know so many people that will then split that list out and sell those leads instantly out as well as like pixel data and stuff like that. Like that's just not something we are comfortable with. And maybe that's stupid, but I also don't know if it's legal, but we just don't do that and we're not fans of that. So people do that with their leads, their apps, and their customers. And down this you get more and more value or you can sell them for more because the customer who just paid 7200 is worth more than a name and email of someone who's just interested in menopause or macronutrients or whatever. Okay. Now, a key thing on here though that is real and true is we only sell 1% of our leads. So, of our current flow, we'll get a hundred uh leads a day. Only one of those people buy our $7,200 program. So, like your math has to back out. And like right now, we're struggling with this. And I have other videos of like where we're currently at. We did 30 million last year, but last month we did like 1.6 million, which is terrible. Um, and trying to turn that around. And the way you do that is just making more money per lead, per app, per customer over time against your advertising costs if you have them, right? You could lean more in organic. You can do all these things. But cross-ell partnerships, and this is back to how we would want to do a model like this, but like the right way. So supplements, again, there's a way to do it. Hormosi literally did this in his business model and I know so many people who do it where it's almost like a requirement when you join. It's like you're going to need creatine, whey protein, uh you know, greens, this and that as your baseline. Like you need them. And now for us, we just didn't do this for a long time because we didn't know who had quality enough supplements where would also make sense in the math. And what we've also come to learn is like a business that is conversion focused, not just like a brand, because it's helpful to be able to just pass the customer off because we might as well make our own supplements if we're going to run the entire sales process and this and this. I mean, obviously there's fulfillment and like harder issues there. So, not to not to discount their business model, but like the ability to sell them and keep them would be very nice if we could just pass it off to somebody and they would just handle it with a customer that's ready to buy or we do the initial purchase, they handle everything after, stuff like that. swag. We already do this a little bit, but we just break even on this. But I know a bunch of companies who do this. But for us, again, all of these have not been that um like sexy to us to do because we're only selling when we were at peak, like 400 and something units a month. So, this just looked like small dollars in comparison, which is kind of like small thinking because these add up and we can get to 20, 50, 100k a month in recurring supplement income that we maybe wouldn't have any costs on because it would just be an affiliate commission, right? Okay. And that was the goal of what we did here. It just never backed out. Um, swag, same thing. So, these are both volume plays as well as MR or on this. And this is more so all just a volume play. We do this right now, but we just break even. And both these for us are extremely important that they're quality. So, you're not getting like a shitty t-shirt that you're never going to wear or that has like bad material or breaks down after four. You're not getting a supplement that has 19 unknown things in it. Like, this extremely important that we keep our brand integrity throughout this. Um, so that's why we haven't done these two, but like both are definitely an opportunity. And then premium health services. This is something new that we heard about. Um, where other companies that are similar to us basically have like an an upsell on top. So if you're selling it for 7,200 a year, you'll then have like an 11K offer or like, you know, a 4K add-on that for the year you also get like a dedicated health services style thing. So they do like full blood panels. they do full um like just overall health testing and things beyond the scope of what you do with nutrition, exercise, like accountability in those pieces. Uh and I think that's an interesting one to think about because the people who are coming in and paying 7200 are interested in that or already do some version of this. So to encompass it all inside our crew is good. Um plus+ is just like anything else we have now with what we're doing with low ticket that is technically an ascension play and an LTV play. It's super small cuz it's like a $37 front end, but there's that. Um, and then other things in this scope are like building out full ecosystems, having full continuity programs that are like membership and community based. Um, having deals with the different like health tech companies because we always talk about Aura rings and eight sleep pods and all these different things. So, it's just about volume and having a good partner that you can pass it off to. Uh so yeah, so this is basically how we lost all this and we turned it off where we no longer provide these kits on the front end early in 2025 and we have noticed no difference in customer experience and yeah so lesson learned and hopefully we find some solid partnerships where we can do this because I'm a huge fan of MR and if we can do that that would be super good. All right, so DM me on Instagram if you have any questions, comment on YouTube, subscribe on YouTube and let me know. production.
