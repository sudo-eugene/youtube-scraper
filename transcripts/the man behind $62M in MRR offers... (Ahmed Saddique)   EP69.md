way. Appreciate it. You too, man. All right, let's kick it off. All right, guys. In today's video, we have Ahmed. I have heard him on X. I have been highly highly recommended to him to talk and do one of these fun videos. We have no structure. We have no plan. And we are actually This is the first one where I haven't talked to him prior to this. So, it's going to be a full get to know. Yeah. First time. Full get to know. So, let's kick it off. So, yeah. I mean, I deep researched you. I'm going to be honest. I I took your ex, I took your YouTube, I fed everything in. I bulk watched a bunch of videos, so I have some context, but for those who don't, who are you? Who's the what's what's the quick slong elevator pitch? Yeah, I got you. And u Yeah, no, it's a pleasure to be here and uh do this with you, Ryan. So, thank you for having me. Um but yeah, I uh basically to keep it really simple started in like marketing in 2017. So before I would like to say like info was glamorized as info like back in the good old days when there was like barely any competition and stuff. Um so I started off as like a CMO at a company as one of my buddies. So like I really didn't know what I was doing. I was just figuring [ __ ] out along the way. Um but that's where I started and we grew that company to about eight figures a year um from 2017 all the way to like COVID 2020 to 2021ish. Um and then after that you know you learned a lot through like the trials and tribulations and messing up a lot and consuming a lot of information from different people. Um but at that point you know this kind of like word of mouth kind of took by storm where it was like more people in the industry started finding out about what we did. Um and again at that time at least from the space I come from is just very organic based. So that's something we could talk about today too is like uh we're very organic centric. So a lot of these big organic brands were like reaching out and they're like hey could you help me out with this? So then we worked with one other person and we scale them then another then another uh and then you know we partnered with some of the biggest kind of mainly trading brands. So we started in the trading space and since then like we've only been in the trading niche like that's the one thing that we've specialized in. Um, and so, you know, I've learned a lot through that and and making a lot of mistakes, too. But, yeah, essentially that led us to where we are now. So, we've probably done close to like I think we're we're probably this year going to cross like definitely like 100 million across all of our partners combined uh and like revenue we've done. And we've done everything from like launch models and different DM strategies because what worked in 2017 didn't work in 2020 and then what worked in 2021 to 2023 2024 doesn't work either, right? So, uh it forced us to adapt a lot. So, I kind of personally have been through like three different market cycles now in this info space. Uh and then today it's like figuring out like what's working today and then also the future of this. So yeah, that pretty much led me here. Um, then I met Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. And now I'm making videos every day. No, that's crazy. So I I mean generally how these will run is just like trench talk. It's like what is actually working now? What is the crazy tweak? What's the Because the true target of this is, you know, multi6figure, seven figure a month people and just networking cool [ __ ] You know, people to hang out with when you're in a city and just chop it up and do stuff like this. And like that's what these conversations started as. We just started filming them. So yeah, I mean, so you can choose to dox or not. I usually don't say like a ton of names. We say stuff that like we, you know, message about, but if you don't want to say company names or brands, that's up to you. But so for 2017, so that was what kind of trading the first one. Um I I won't I won't say the name and the brand. Yeah, I was going to say it's up to you. But yeah, but some people might know the name if they're watching this and they know me. Like some people could put it together. So if you can, great. Um but um it it was just a trading offer. um it was a big brand um like a personal brand and at at that time even p personal brands were not like a thing right I think now they're just more like mainstream like you kind of need it in almost anything right u but at that time it wasn't like a huge thing so what was working then was honestly like I kid you not like I I have screenshots of this like I could probably send it to your like we pop it up here but we literally had I would have to know how to do that yeah but we literally had like a five and a 10k K offer on like a notes app screenshot and like this is how like you know like the decentralized the market was at like you know it wasn't saturated there was no competition um and this brand just had a really cultlike audience and it took off because like he the the founder ended up doing a YouTube video with some person and it just blew the [ __ ] up like there wasn't any real secret through to it and like we were just like again I'm all new to this so I'm figuring it out but we legit at that time had like the whole offer just pasted on a note tab and we just DMing it to people. Wow. And it was like an inerson slash like hybrid online type of thing. Yeah. I was going to say let's get into that. I mean like let's go. So you said five and 10k offer. So like literally what what like you're accepting payments on a Stripe link. You had a sales team. You're doing DM. So So no sales team. Um it was all through DMs. So that was like our main acquisition channel. We had like a company page and then like the personal brand page and people would just literally DM us from that interview which kind of really took off. And um from there we just you know the founder went heavier on YouTube build a lot more credibility in the market and just we just doubled down. Yeah. And for like 3 years we just went on a tear. So we ended off um you know all the way to the end of like co like 20 end of 2020 and then the founder ended up just dumping the info and leaning into SAS. So he's in a SAS company now uh which is why he left that. Um, but he's still around and a lot of the guys, again, if you're in the trading space, you probably like will know who I'm talking about, but I'm not in the trading space and I think I know who you're talking about. So, yeah. Exactly. So, legend. Yeah. He's a legend. Exactly. And so, like and and to be fair, like we can go deeper on the organic stuff, but Yeah. Something cool about him is the fact that um organic brands I've noticed usually don't have that much of a lifespan. Like a lot of personal brands, they really burn out their audience and they don't know how to stay relevant for a long enough time. cool thing about him was the fact that like his shift into SAS I think helped kind of like keep him more relevant because the superpower became like I'm not going to sell you anything, right? Kind of like Alex Forzosi which is I think what made him stand out from everyone else, right? Um and so there's a lot of that element that helped but then from there it was just like I was like well what do I do from here? But we had people reaching out like, "Hey, could you do the same thing you did for me?" And then that's when the info stuff started for me really uh getting into the weeds of stuff. But like legit, I was doing like weird sales calls like over the phone during like the 2017 and 2030 era. Like I didn't know what sales calls were. I didn't know what email campaigns were. Like I was literally like just a young kid. Um I knew this guy and he was just like, "Hey, here's all the hats to the company and just like let's build this thing and like just do it." So looking back there's what I know now if I if I wish I knew then like we could have done crazy high tens high tens real quick. Yeah. Yeah. like really and and I mean to be fair even if he was to launch something again today which is something we joke about but it wouldn't make sense for him but um he just tear I mean yeah I assume we're talking about the same yeah or I'm thinking of the same person or whatever but yeah that the evolution of personal brand in a way like you said where you where you're not selling something but also where I mean Iman talks about this hormone lives this right these guys like you're on the journey of the growth through the personal brand, right? It's like Eman saying it's like, oh, it was like SMMA or it was like, you know, a human, a young kid trying to do something, then it was like SMMA, then it was online business overall, then it was personal development, then it was like, you know, public fa figure fame, but like still tapping into these and when you can go on that journey and even if you do sell stuff like even, you know, Elon kind of sells stuff, right? You sell through proxy, you don't sell direct, right? And it's like, yeah, super powerful. So, so you're you're DMing 5 and 10K offers. People are literally paying on like a Stripe link and then you're what was this like stack then? You're getting them in a Discord. You're getting them in like a Yeah, just it was Kajjabi at the time. We still We still rock Kajjabi. So, yeah, Kajjabi is good. It's good backbone. Kajjabi. It was Discord and then there was like an in-person thing at the time like we were going on like a a world tour uh doing like classes in like New York um you know different just cities across the map. So like we maximized even like the in-person stuff. So like that objection was like oh you can't make it there like don't worry we're going to make sure that you come you you can near you. So that that really did well. At one point that was flocking from like anywhere from like 500 to a million a month just through like DM links. Like it was crazy. And so the structure of team at that point is a handful of like CS style like and you know a couple operators. Yeah. And the brand. Yeah. It was like me and like a few other people and like just some VAS and like just like you know that's pretty much it. Like there was no structure to it. Like there was like as complex as it is today like I would love to go back to those good old days. Um but but today you have to like pull arm and a leg and have a structure and have a eight player team and a eight player tech stack and like it's it's so much more complex now. But those days like it's like I tell people and they're just like like dude like that's just crazy. And I'm like like I know like I I wish we could go back and this was all organic like there was no paid being done. Um but I think that was just the power at the time. I think a lot of it especially in the in the info e-learning personal brand space like um if you have an organic brand you got to really know how to lean into your strengths and like your weaknesses. And at the time like the strength was the brand right? Like we weren't doing anything special marketing wise to sell. It was just that the face and his credibility sold, right? And and so like when there's like, hey, what's what was the secret truthfully there wasn't. It was just it was a really unstructured way of like doing stuff like trying out a webinar like [ __ ] it. Okay. Like yeah, whatever method gets just Yeah. just more inflow. That's crazy because if you think about like you just said like the good old day or those times I mean if you're rocking organic you know some VAS and whatever that thing's a 60 to 80% you know margin. It was high margins like Yeah, that's crazy, you know? I mean, no sales teams. No Exactly. No, no DM setters existed. Like that wasn't a thing. Like we were just like doing it. The same people that were selling were the same people. Yeah. Doing the customer support stuff. And like I was, you know, just doing all of it, you know? Yeah. Dude, there's so much value in like ignorance. Yeah. Yeah, so much value where it's like, you know, there it's not built in that, oh, what do you mean? A DM setter makes one to three points and a closer needs to make 10 and they're separate people and then the manager makes override and then CS gets their thing and they can hand only handle up to 30 before they go to the next trunch and it's like all that stuff that like is everywhere now and is expected. And then we've never done a good job and like I don't know how I mean by the sounds of it and the VA and stuff like that then but our stuff has always been like you know North America US like style employment too. So then you've got that and you have the in a nice way like type of person and expectation and like work ethic and stuff in tied to a generally speaking higher wage and it just wasn't like that back then. Yeah%. Yeah, we're W2 everything. You know, I joke I'm like, "Oh, we have an HR director like crazy." Like she's great. But like it's, you know, 130 people. It's no Yeah, it's no joke. So yeah, no margins like 80%, let me tell you. Yeah. To it, you know. Yeah. GPT yanked on here and said 62 million. It came it pulled from somewhere. Yeah. Which is cra that's that's high. Like that's Yeah. There's only a handful of people that I've talked to that do size. Like that's cool. So you did that one as your first one. Then it went into like what you'd consider agencyish. Yeah, we took on one partner and then like what we do now is like we work with just like a hand like we basically still do like the done for use kind of stuff, but um just partner focused like we try to just find brands that you know we know that will have the legs to a be relevant in a couple years from now and you know have the credibility and there just like a lot more checklists that we have now. um a through learning through bad partnerships and b through uh just experiencing different type of audiences within the same niche because we could we could dive into that. No, no, I'm Yeah, because I'm I'm curious a lot of things on that. It's like one, what is the scope? Where do you stop on what you do for service work? So like are you guys growth operator? Are you marketing operator? Are you you know where what's the line on that? Yeah. So we are are are very customized. Like we do everything from we come in and I personally like to just have skin in the game in terms of like I like to be part of product. I like to be part of marketing. I like to be part of sales. That's just how I do things and how I've always done it coming from that because I wore all the hats, right? And you learn that like, you know, product influences marketing and marketing influences this. And it's like, you know, I I just don't feel comfortable personally ever going into a business and being like, hey, you're limited to only playing in this sandbox because that's just not how we're going to get the full potential of this, right? So, I am we come in willingly being like, hey, we will do we will help you structure and better offer pricing, making it unique, standing out in a in a very saturated um space. We'll do the marketing. So naturally I'm a marketer first, sales person second. So like I'm I'm more like into the marketing weeds of it. Like I I've gotten into the sales world now because of like the industry evolved, but naturally I'm more of a fan of like doing so well in marketing to make the sales process very easy. Yeah. That's just my my way of going about it. Layups, right? Yeah. So, so you know, we we essentially do the full N yard, but we only do that for those that we see huge potential in to to stick around for years to come and like not just get, you know, knocked off the chessboard because of like one wrong move or one marketing move or like the the ones that don't have a big enough backbone, right? So, um, those partnerships, you know, and then sometimes it takes like, you know, six months to a year for us to even just build like I I take my time with like building a relationship and like who we want to partner with. And then we'll just do some like consulting work here and there and and most of the time like I'm just jumping on calls for for free to be honest. Then just like helping people out and be like, "Hey, like we probably can't help you, but like if you do these two three things like probably just boost your like, you know, ARR by like this much, you know?" Yeah. You can get to a couple hundred grand. Yeah. Yeah. So, so like um you know that that's the kind of structure we are at right now. But yeah, it's it's it's hard to to scale that because then quality diminishes for us, right? So we can only work with so many people uh which is why we're so careful about it. But you know that to me is more fun like I' I'd rather try to build towards the big big kind of leagues and like Yeah. So yeah, that's like your service scope. What is if you don't mind this part, what is your like monetization tie scope like? Because you know a lot of these guys will do there's a lot right there's there's spread between like a lot of the paid guys will do like you know off a paid number or they'll do new minus paid and a percent of that they'll do profit share they'll do rev share they'll do like you know there's a million of them what do you got if you're touching everything you're getting pi of everything. Yeah pretty much. Yeah. Um, so, so we, you know, essentially we do come in like essentially just real partners. Like we kind of like come in and we're like, "Hey, we have a full stack team of people that I trust and know the operations and we'll come in and we'll deploy this force." It it really depends um on like the business and like who it is because like if they require more of a team size and like we have to go like recruit on your behalf now and it's not like we're recruiting to keep this person in our company like we will recruit but that's someone we're hiring for you whether it's marketing or whether it's this where so like everyone has their own way of doing stuff. Some people are like, "Hey, I'd rather like, you know, do this, but you help me hire to build an in-person team for this department, right?" And so, like, it's very flexible depending on like what their needs are. But the biggest thing that we just ask for is like, "Hey, like can we have control, right? Can we have the freedom to like play around with product, marketing, and sales?" If that's not cool, that's totally fine, too. But that's just like I'm not jumping into into bed with this, like you know. Yeah. Um, so like it is like more of like, hey, we're taking revshare. Sometimes we'll take like depending on if there's a lot of upfront work required, you know, before we even start that relationship. Maybe there's like some like we've done retainers and stuff like that. But again, very, you know, customized to those um kind of wheels, I guess, if you want to. Yeah. So, generally it's a it's a rev share deal though, generally. Yeah, pretty much. That's so clean. That's so much cleaner. I have like Yeah. I just I talked to Josh Gavin yesterday and his is, you know, offer publisher. They take they pick an expert. He owns everything. Yeah. He owns the IP, which is so interesting to me because like there's a there's so many ways to structure it. And you know, ours I I I said in this one, but I didn't have the wherewithal to understand how to do that. Like I understood the business model. I understood the info. Like I understood it on paper or like from watching courses, but I never built one. And then the you know, I came into that company and those the co-founders had done that, right? But his stack was, you know, majority minority stack on total company. Built the whole thing and they were direct partners in it. But it's cool when you can do it how you are. I so you know depth question. Can one of those be the like what's the theory behind do they compete? Are they you know you said you're having like unique propositions across them so like they stand out in the marketplace but like you know is and I don't know the trading space super well. Like obviously there's different like lanes within there but like a lot of you know I'm sure there's some overlap sometimes. How does that work? or is there a reason you wouldn't just be like this is the one and you're going to like crew them all up and do an eman thing where it's like one of them and they have different styles and you own the whole thing. Yeah. So I think you know over the time like I've like I said gotten more particular with the partnerships. Um, and part of that's because my goal is to just find those black swans that can get to like the nine figure level at a at a point. Um, to do that though, you got to like work on the car a bit, right? Like usually you can't just go to the dealer for like to say use this as an analogy and just pick a car because there's so many times even within the trading space like brand names I could probably maybe share offscreen uh but like no doxing you know and and you wouldn't even imagine that this brand's capable of pulling this but you only learned when you looked under the hood and you're like holy [ __ ] this person doesn't even know what they're sitting on right and it's like the demo that they got tapped into YouTube is just like a whole other freaking dark hole um of of things in terms of like the audience you can reach and the demo you can reach within trading, right? And and here's the thing. I'll take a step back too like within trading specifically. It's such a big tan if you look at it in terms of the market because let's compare like SMMA for example or like ecom or like any other sort of like offer. There's like a friction point of entry for like the average consumer, right? because it's like you got to set up like the LLC, you got to set set up the Shopify store, like whatever, whatever. Like there's a lot more of like a barrier of entry. And I guess one could make the argument that you could charge more because of that, right? Uh but then with trading, it's like you could just like people just take their phone and it's like they open up Robin Hood or some [ __ ] and they start trading, right? So the barrier of entry is so like little which makes the TAM like inter it's international. It's global, right? Um and then there's different markets within like there's a German market and then there's the Indian market and then there's like the US market predominantly and then there's umbrellas within trading right and so we've touched all different umbrellas so we know that that vertical of trading has like a very low buying power because of like what the trading kind of like intricacies demand right and then there's like the other ones that they're probably a smaller pool compared to that one but they are required to have more liquid capital to trade compared to these guys. And so you the buying power for these guys is insane. Interesting. So it it's so many that's why like for us it just never made sense to branch out of it. Yeah. Because it's it's such a big market within its own. So you know like we've just stuck with it, you know, and so it's pretty cool. But yeah, I always I try and like this doing all these different things at once right now is like it's literally like ruining my life. It's crazy. Like I I get so spread across cuz I want to do everything like to a tea. I'm like who has access like this and this and perfectly and like the calendar structure and I get I'm like so in the weeds with like that's how I operate is like very so doing all this at once. So when I think about this and like having multiple clients and whatever to me that's like oh my gosh if I had to log into six different Slacks like that would be the end of me versus like having one and that's where we're moving to is instead of having multiple we're going to have multiple faces, multiple angles, multiple you know you could call them niches. It's really messaging. It's still the same like actual niche because our TAM is so large but same with you but like having the different angles and having different like one is and I don't know a lot about trading but like quick ones is like equity you know options versus like crypto let's just say right like having those two and having different brand faces that all funnel though to one core thing exactly is very an interesting idea. So for you guys, what's the what's like your I mean I was I was gonna say your LTV to CAC, but like you probably have little to no CAC because you're anic, but what's the what's like the longtail this on average? It's it's generally speaking the monetization method of the actual business is a recurring subscription generally. Right. Right. Y and then you did something that was a big a higher ticket that was like a term based. Yeah. So um so you're talking about like product structures, right? Yeah. So like when you for the actual units for like when you're selling to a direct to consumer through one of these brands they're buying either you know you set a five or 10k thing that's a sixmon package and then you have a other people who do these you know WP groups with 10,000 people in them that's monthly. Yeah. So, so that's something really interesting about again adding on to trading, right? Um, so the powerhouse that's working right now is like low ticket subscriptions for trading and I I haven't seen outside of the space as much. Like I've heard numbers and like I watch like stuff videos, but um the reason why trading works so well is like most traders don't really want you to teach them how to catch a fish, right? Like this is the archetype of breaking down the thing, but they'd rather just follow along. And so this is where like signal channel yeah FTC wise like I'm going to like you know you got to there's a fine line right I don't sell any of this by the way or have any idea what he's talking about but but yeah I mean so there's a level of like you know people will just want to follow like there's more demand for that than there is for like the high ticket like kind of like hey we're going to teach you how to do this right that's just the archetype of a trader. Um, however, like you'd be surprised. Like I know I actually spoke to like a guy like we're in talks, but um he has a YouTube channel with like 140k subs and you wouldn't even imagine the MR this guy's pulling based on his channel, but he's doing a it's costs like a big I think 100 bucks a month for this monthly subscription and he has 6,000 members. And if you look at the graph, so if you do the math on that, it's about 600k in MR just from low ticket. And the graph's just like a blue chip stock, right? Like there's no churn, there's no like heavy spikes. And that's going to be heavily dependent on how well you are as a brand. And like I was gonna say I have so many questions, but everyone yells at me for interrupting. So I'm going to show you. But like it's like that that's really heavily dependent on h how well of a trader you are to a degree and how well of a brand you are because no one's going to stay if you don't make them money, right? It's just the the nature of it. Um, but that's like what we've seen and like the method that I've always liked selling high ticket is like very like underground and like very different than everyone else in the industry because I feel like if everyone's doing this one thing, especially for organic, we have to be more pretentious because it's like it's not just pay to VSSL to call. Like it's like we have to protect the brand reputation from just burning out and just doing call to actions on your Instagram story. like that stuff probably works and I know the Instagram shoutouts and all of that but it's like I like to do like more underground selling which is what we're doing right now and it's like I'll again I can show you probably off screen but like show rates we're getting are like anywhere from 80 to 90%. U insane stuff. Uh but a lot of it flow to get them there. What was that? Sorry. What's the journey or the flow to get them there? You said like underground's like how it's more like back like pretty much back in ascension pretty much from the load. Right. So, like to put it simply, like the way I've positioned for most of these guys is like we only give those people the option to book a call if they're in the buyer's pocket essentially. Like they got to deserve to get the link to book a call and jump on a team with us, right? Um, and a lot of that like if you're in the low ticket, you're kind of in our ecosystem, so we welcome you, right? So there's a level of like you have a little bit more of a backd and and everyone else is handing it out more of like a commodity thing where you could just like pick it off a bookshelf and purchase it and when you do that the demand goes down for it, right? So we control demand like we control it. I like to have that kind of structure and it makes it more potent for the other person to be like, I'd rather join this because it's a whole different customer journey than what they're usually used to. Like every time we do a sales call, like we're reviewing sales calls, it's like they the average trader has already taken multiple programs and has a traumatic experience and the last thing they want to do is go through the same flow of the same conversation that's kind of being out there, right? So when we take this approach everyone and then the sales style is also very different right it can't the same stuff that's working for paid stuff like in terms of sales teams like does not work for us like we've tried it it's crazy um but like I I'll show numbers to people on like dashboards that we have and like they're just like this is like it's it doesn't make sense for like if I was to if you were to apply what we do for paid it just wouldn't work. No. But if you do, but if you understand the context behind it, it's like, "Holy [ __ ] I get I get what you're doing." Oh, yeah. I mean, it's literally you have an organic and then gated and then through buyer and then like Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. So interesting. So when you're Okay, so the classic model is like heavy consumption on something organic, generally a YouTube and Instagram or something or Tik Tok, whatever, like that. They're consuming heavy. They come in on an MR play. They're in for x amount of months. They're warm enough. they have, you know, I mean, I could go so many questions about just like activation and keeping them in there. And obviously simple answer is make the money. Exactly. Um, but keep them happy. Then what is the ticket on the back? And I'm sure it changes, but is it a five? Is it a 20? Is it a 50? So the next step above that, and I'll I'll this is going to be fun, but so the next step above that, it depends on the offer, but there's a few anywhere right now that we have that are ranging from 5 to 10. And it just comes back to personalization. The higher upend ones have more one-to-one coaching attached to it. The ultimate difference to keep it really simple. The ones that are on their lower end don't have like a a onetoone element to it, but it's more like group styled for for it. Right. So that's like the the barrier we have there. And then uh for one of the partners we have right now, we're actually working on like a 20 30k offer on the top of that. But that's going to be um again I probably gonna have to show you off screen with this but uh it's in more of an in-person hybrid structure um which I feel like is where the pendulum is kind of swinging. agree because like there's like I see offers and it's like especially within trading it's like Discord curriculum Kajjabi whatever and webinars like those are like denominators that prospects expect you to already have right like they're not paying you 5K for that. Yeah. Uh they're they want they're coming on that call for like what else, right? And so like ultimately like the two things that it comes down to is like either people are going to pay you more money for access or customization, right? And so how do we bridge more access? So we're doing inerson in a way where it's still scalable but and I could probably go into that a little bit more too. It's scalable um and it's not like a one-off like an event type of thing where it's like one and done but we can constantly acquire customers for it. Uh that's a challenge within person that I've felt. But this is so interesting. This is like flipped on its head from how most info coaching and stuff is because right it's like for you you're doing you're doing like the done for you as the cheapest lowest like whatever like you know the the list the whatever highest margin. Yeah. But also like the low MR and people are paying then for done with you or do it yourself. They're like to learn the education port. That's which is and most of these is flipped, right? Because usually it's like, you know, you get the book for $9 and it has everything you need to learn it, but then you right here do a group coaching thing for 5K and then over here you work with the one guy one-on-one. It's 50K and it's the same information that's here. It's just how it's implemented. Yours is on flipped on its head. Yeah. It's crazy. Which is so Okay. So that's just I literally have 150 questions. So that's that's just the info and coaching. Yeah. monetization path or portion. Yeah. So like there is there not there's trading partnership play like the there's software plays there's like as referrals and stuff like what else did these guys monetize on? So if we take it a step I don't know if what the like know like because for example like I know these guys in the crypto thing they like point whatever and someone shared a screenshot they made 250 soul just by like organically sharing you know the referral link to a platform for example is like you guys do plays like that is there stuff like that or like the the funded trader I see stuff I don't I don't know how this works so that's where it gets a little bit more out of my scope at that point because I a wouldn't want to get involved in that because then the SEC and [ __ ] might get well that's not allowed referrals No, you could the referral stuff. Yeah, but I guess like a different monetizational route like you mentioned like partnering with them like taking funding from people to like Yeah. I don't know because I know that like for so for example I know of you know there's the three main like I was funny having fun to generate meme trader thing when I had just like a ton of time and I was living in Puerto Rico. I would do 5 hours a day for like a month and all these guys have these links to like these different crypto platforms and whatever where they get percents as like rewards and then I saw other people doing it and like they do it. Oh, join my you know you said Robin Hood but like some of the more trading specific softwares like they break. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's backend like Oh yeah. So, like partnership wise, like there's so much software, like there's back-end partnerships. Like I know I can't go into specifics of which companies, but like I know brands that we work with that they have like six figure plus monthly retainer deals. Um like retainer like not like a like your affiliate commit like retainer you get paid. Yeah. And then commissions like you know the bigger you and the better you are like you know the better you're going to do on that part. But the there's backend deals on backend deals and that's gray area somehow. Um, not it depends on the company. If we go into like brokers and stuff like that, that's where it's like depending on the domain of trading you're in like options for example is like super like regulated, right? Like like you can't you can't [ __ ] around in that. Uh, but if you go into forex and [ __ ] like Yeah. Yeah. Like I I'd probably I'd probably like tuck that away, right? Interesting. And so so that that's the domain, right? So it's like um right now there's like these prop firms like funding like companies and so that's like you that's like the and that's more so like for futures specifically right and so like futures is like I guess the in between in terms of like I'm going to go by so the traders don't attack me it's like in the in the terms of buying power like options would have the highest buying power forex would have the lowest futures is kind of like in between because you technically don't need capital to trade because you're buying like a challenge or something And if you pass like the challenge, you get funded a certain amount. But there's some sketchy companies, there's some legit ones. Uh like it's it's again like closer the further we get to this. I saw someone Yeah. I saw someone posted it and it was like they won like a gift like a certificate thing from one and I was like I didn't it was like they won like two grand. I'm like I don't know. I don't know anything about that world. Yeah. So it's it's like some of those companies are legit. Like you actually will get paid out and they have a good track record but some of them are just like pretty shady. Like so it's like you'll pass your challenge and your account and you're supposed to earn whatever and they'll just be like well sorry like you did this this wrong and they'll just like gify it out and it's like kind of like a casino. They're playing like a casino [ __ ] game. Yeah. Um but I don't know where the qu what the question was. No. Yeah. So around there. So yeah. So monetization around info and coaching is crazy. Yeah, your cost your cost to acquire customer is you know your marketing budget essentially for your for organic team to just produce content and you know social media manage at some level and then so that's so so and then cost to fulfill you said group coaching I mean a group is a group like an MR group you know so whatever you need there a couple CS you know some people from the community you upgrade up but that's low and then your group coaching style stuff is does is it normal for the expert to do other stuff other than pop in the chat and you drop stuff and do their signaling they do or like Yeah. So, is there I I guess the question is there an in between where there's hard cost that's not time of the person who's the expert? Mainly the fulfillment would be just the coaches like crazy. Yeah. Just like one-on- ones like that's going to just be like I'm probably not I won't go into exact deal structure some of them have but like it's like either they'll like they'll work out a deal with each coach I'll say. Right. And so like um but we just obviously protect ourselves because we know like the hard cost is like for each unit that we sell we have to pay this much in fulfillment cost which is like pretty much all it cost at that point. U besides like the sales team but you know that that's pretty much it. Um, but then if if there's like even in the like there's an element where where there'll be that and then the founder usually like it's it's interesting because some of the more guys that are like actually passionate about trading and make real money with trading uh they like actually enjoy teaching and stuff so they'll like pop in like they want to be part of the fulfillment. Like you see this paradox where it's like some guys are like hey like I don't give a [ __ ] about that. Like I'm just trying to scale to like yeah like 100 million fastest way get me there. And I'm like, usually that's like bunch of red flags, FTC written all over it. Like I don't even I you know, but then there's other brands and I would consider them like more black swans where it's like because they actually enjoy the process to a degree. They are usually like they overthink everything a lot more than the because they're not natural marketers. They're natural traders, right? They do this for a living and they're just like, "Hey, like I I want to spend time with like the community and stuff." So what do you Yeah. You know, you hear the hormosies, whatever. So, I've never done anything in in like MMO and I don't know. I mean, this kind of sits in like an MMO and we always kind of joke it's like, you know, the coach teaching the coach teaching the coach is like not the speed. I'm not a fan at all. And I like kind of publicly say that. I don't diss on anyone. Like, everyone's got their own thing. There's a lot of guys I think that it's super valuable that sell info to other info people that, you know, they they they get around a specific domain. So like one guy's extremely good at webinars, one guy's extremely good at like setting, you know, setters, one guy's extremely good at this, and they all sell to each other. You know, you use this person, they use this person. And like I think there's a space for that because they're doing something unique within it. It's the guys that are selling generally speaking like mass market, B TOC, you know, B uh to C, and they're selling how to make money online basically, and they make all their money by teaching people how to make money. Like that's the one where I'm like, eh, like no. So I'm going to ask because you hear you know Hormosi or these guys talk about it. They're like you know if these traders are making so much XYZ why are they doing info and education? And I understand right you're saying like they want I mean one it's a giant you know it's a major generator of cash but is there a place in a space for them to just like if they're that good is it valuable to gatekeep? Is there a way they can do it at a level where they add another zero or two and they make as much or more? Like I don't know anything about that world. Yeah. So, and this I don't want to speak for the traders specifically, but I'll say like the stuff that Yeah. And this is my question. This is not I'm sorry. Yeah. If this is like a dive against clientele, it's not meant to don't understand. Yeah. So, so for a lot of them, I'll be honest, like especially the ones that make money through trading, like I know for a fact u like they'll do well for them like seven figures plus even close to maybe eight figures a year through trading, right? But then to get to that next level from there, you essentially will need to risk more capital. Yeah. Of your own. Right. And if you know anything about trading, not all trades will go your way. Yeah. Right. So there's a big risk factor. So, I think there's a level of like I know certain guys and that guy we were talking about earlier, I don't know how long you've been tracking him, but if you scroll back like he's done really really well for himself in in a lot of different markets, but the one thing about him is he's had really big wins because he's been able to size up, right? That's about it, you know, like that's the secret to it. So, like most most of these guys like they're just not willing to do that. And that's totally fine. Like it's still preference. Like it's like in marketing I got my preferences. Like trading you got your own. No. No. For sure. And so I guess yeah and and the other part of that is then how far you take it within that because I I challenge this with like anyone I'm talking to and we kind of talked about a little is like you know why don't you have one of these that has you know multiple faces in it and it's like your behemoth or even taking one of these like how do you take one you know you said a hundred you know are there exit plays or the bigger one and I use like life insurance life insurance as an example because I know guys who have done this who run an info product coaching whatever that's basically around like some version of taxation and this or whatever and life insurance is like the vehicle they use but they like keep what it is they sell all the info and the education which is valuable in itself and worth the dollars but then they talk about this thing over here they sell life insurance on the back again I don't know any legality of any of this no one this is not me doing this and then they sell this stuff and then they make huge commissions so their LTV CAC you know was five call it right here on info and coaching but then they have this other monetization model where they can then make 50 and a hundred times and built in. I have another one that I'm talking to right now that just found me through this that does stuff in a sports niche and teaches people how to do XYZ and is very very dialed in. They have crazy results. Almost all of it's organic. And on the back end, there's the angle to do, let's just say, like percents of large deal. Like they get things that can be no joke, double their entire annual revenue on this thing that haven't even launched yet on a couple deals of hundreds of students potent like they have this opportunity to do that. So what's the opportunity in this because like what's the next what's the depth of the layer? Is it a hedge fund? Is it like funding? Is it being the bank? I don't know how that works. Yeah. So I think um and this is for you're you're saying like what's their like goal at the end of it? Well, yeah. Or you right if you're a partner in this at some level. So it's like yours could be you take it and then you have a bunch of the these guys inside your umbrella. You do what you know what Iman basically did with educate call it in online business space of all these different ones. You do it within just trading. So you have someone who does crypto. You have someone who does this. They have this. You have that machine. You make all this crazy margin on info and coaching already. You have your tiers of that. You have your partnerships that you can make money on maybe or however that works legality. I don't know. What is like the moonshot on the tail of that where you're like you pick the best people out of there and you fund them. You pick them out of there and you have a hedge fund. You have like what I don't even know. Yeah. So, I mean it's a two-parter, right? Because I I'll answer it from a client's point of view and I'll answer it from my point of view. Okay. Right. So, from a client's point of view, I guess this always just comes down to really like how far someone wants to play the game. Take it, right? Um, like I I know some aggressive people that are like, "Hey, I'm with you and let's try to get this to 100 mil." Um, and then I have guys that are like, "Hey, I'm good with 1020 and I'll call it at that." And if I do that and I go on a 3, four year run, I'm happy. Yeah. Right. And so I think expectations with like for us too as partners are like super aligned with like how far someone can go. Um obviously if someone's like coming to us and they're delusionally not at any level to get to a certain degree like we'll call them out and be just like hey like you know applaud the ambition but like buddy like you got to like hit certain other milestones and usually just comes down to traffic source right um like a big thing that's working right now and I think the guys in our space at the very least that took YouTube seriously one two three years ago where YouTube wasn't just you now like you can post a video, subscribers don't matter. Yeah. And you could blow up, right? Back then it wasn't that, right? Like you had to earn your way up the YouTube ladder, right? And so the guys that spent time on their channels that understood the YouTube game, that got ahead of the YouTube game and adapted really quickly, that's the engine we've noticed. Insane, right? Like Instagram doesn't move the needle as much. Like I know some guys are like deep in the DM world and they got stuff cooking there and I'm like I usually try to learn from moment stuff but I'm just like I that doesn't really pertain really well with the marketing angles that we're taking, right? Because then we have to sell from the face of the brand and put DM setters in there and that just dilutes a lot of the stuff from what I see. And I'm just like that feels very icky and not it's not my I mean it's that it's that trade-off of consumption, right? It's and and like warmth of where they get which is you know a function of that but it's like when you're saying 80% shows and all that on buyers who are in it like you don't get that from DM setting gold outbound you don't get that you don't exactly so I I'd like to I just like to play a more dense and efficient game right so it's mainly YouTube mainly YouTube is the one the driving source and and the channels that are like the ones that know how to get the views and they they know how to keep evolving the content and stay relevant enough. Um, those are ones that it's kind of like a long-term investment account. Like I consider their YouTube channel like S&P 500, right? Because it's not going to go anywhere as long as they stay consistent, as long as they stay relevant, as long as they keep doing the right moves. Like Iman's a perfect example in terms of like organic because he's done, if you notice and you and you follow his stuff closely, it's like he's done those pivots so well to make sure that his name is still around, right? Uh because there was a phase of like let me make the Iman Gazi style content, right? Like he's coined that to himself and then that wave because everything's waves, right? Like things are working then things don't. And then he goes the other way. Exactly. By the time he's already like telling you something like he's already on the next Yeah. the next ship. He's on paid now because you're all on organic. Yeah. Exactly. So So there's So there's that, right? He's smart. He's smart 100%. And and you know he's he's he's a cool dude. But I think um again a lot of it just comes down to like a person's goals. Like there's some people like for example that I see more potential in than others. Like sometimes they won't see the potential that they even have, right? And I'll be like yo dude like you're like not a pawn on the chessboard. Like you have es and those are usually the guys that I think that have like real authenticity. Like they're real traders. They have they come in with the receipts every single month and they're like yo I do this for a living. Uh, like I don't care if my info numbers dip. Like I'm still doing my thing. And that's the best place to be because then you don't force marketing, right? Oh, exactly. And so, dude, desperation bleeds through anything you ever do. And that's where in any part of your life, 100%. And that's any part. And I've seen it so many times with a lot of brands like because I've seen especially within the trading brands, I've seen brands climb to the moon where like some brands were doing like this is like 2022, 2021. And I remember there was one brand, there's this guy, he was doing a million a month in MR through his like subscription thing. Um, I kid you not, 6 months later, all went away, right? One, two stupid moves. Desperation gets a little crazier. You start making call to actions. And so like it just it just [ __ ] like your whole like you'll you'll never be able to that's a that's like if you ever like seen Jeff Bezos like theory on like the twod door and the one door stuff, it's like you know organic you can't [ __ ] around. Like it's a one door. Like every move you make Oh, then yeah. You can't come back up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like your rep once your reputation is gone, it's gone. And I've seen it. And like guys that were on the pace to do 10 20 million a year blew it all away because of one two stupid dumb moves or they did too many back-end partnership deals and they got a little greedy on that side and they started pushing pushing pushing and they bled everything out and right. So they just screw up everything. So I think as much as like you know I tell a lot of the guys we work with I'm like as much as like cash flow is important and for us to try to hit the million months like every single time and like scale scale scale like at what cost? Right? Because like on the back like if we can keep selling more on the back end and make you not look as salesy on the front end, wouldn't that be the best move for you? Right? Because you could do that because you know you can either try to moonshot it and try to be like hey we're going to go for a 50 to 100 blow your gasket doing it and never sell anything for the rest of your life or sell something maybe it's 10 20 but you could do it for 5 years consistently and you still get there. It took a little bit longer but you didn't blow up your reputation and make yourself look like you know one of those sleazy car salesman and just like 100%. So what do you see with the you know that's the person right like you're saying like that's and that's the whole business for you guys right is a lot of the time that personal brand I assume what how do you navigate that with the with the lifestyle with the lifestyle approach that a lot of these guy I mean again I I only see it from the outside and randomly on Instagram or like you know money Twitter and stuff but like the lifestyle approach and kind of twofold question is one you know I'm hearing you say a lot like you know 10 or 20 or hundred of these things. What is like an What is an average of that? Is that like your p is that what you're like pacing? That's what you guys like kind of consistently sit in the pocket of getting these guys to 10 or 20 like Yeah. So, should I answer the lifestyle question first? Well, I was Yeah. Well, because now I'm curious. I'm like, if they're doing 10 or 20, then the lifestyle that like is there you can I mean that's not that much. If you're doing a few those lifestyles can get a little crazy. If you're doing a few million bucks a year and you're doing the lifestyle like some of these guys like the because then sorry my brain is like then that wraps around to this desperation thing because if it does start to churn if the consistency doesn't have the inflows the desperation starts to feed because you're living this lifestyle you're spending 150 a month or whatever. Yep. And if you're not making Oh, you know million a month you're you're like at you're burning. Yeah. Let me get into that. So that's a that's a very slippery slope in my very I've seen some extreme extreme extreme things on the organic side. And so, um, I think here's the thing, touching on the lifestyle subject, I think if you were playing the game in 2020 to 2023 organically, at least in the trading space, I can't speak for most others, but in the trading space, and I think this would be applicable to most other like niches, Airbnb, ecom, whatever you want to call it, like back then, the car games, like you know, elevating your lifestyle, it worked to a degree. Um, and it worked well. But you know what's crazy right now? Like we have a few lifestyle guys. Um, what the moves the needle is the YouTube and the YouTube about raw style like the lifestyle stuff. Like I just I love it. I love it. We just had a partner. We just had a partner. if he's watching this, you might know about who I'm talking about, but they just bought like a million dollar car and I kid you not, like it did not like push anything, right? Um, and and it's just it's for brand awareness, sure, but it's only going to usually impress the people like me, you, or like other info guys in the space is what I'm noticing is like it doesn't it doesn't appeal to because and and this has just been a common thing I've I've said and we've I've noticed from day one is like if a 100 people are going in this direction, just [ __ ] go this way. Yeah. Right. Like you have a better chance because like getting like a million dollar supercar now is like it's common, right? Especially if you go to Miami, it's like they're handing them out like candy, right? And so I'm not against And by the way, like I love and I have no Yeah, me too. I'm like I say that to to each their own. Like I don't I don't I don't judge like yo listen respect if you guys like listen it's fine. It's not nothing no hate, no shame. I don't care. Uh, but it when it comes to conversions, like I straight up tell people I'm like, "Hey, like it's sure, but like it's if you expect that to and I I I always say like keep that on there. Don't screw up the the main engine, which is YouTube, right? Um, so you got to know how to play it the right way, but like the lifestyle stuff is just all cooked to be honest. Like it's just not like if you're play like if you're playing that game, you got to do you got to be really extreme with it." Yeah. And then that's where it's like you might as well just break even with almost everything you're making to sustain it. So is it even worth it at that point to play the game, right? Um but the raw stuff works. The raw like everyone's leaning towards raw like the pendulum always swings and it's it's swung already. And um the guys that can provide like information and simplify it like Hermosi's like content for example like I think his edge is like he can take a very complex topic and simplify it and for like the average business owner or like person and consumer. So it's like oh wow great. So if you could do that I feel like in any niche like that's where YouTube's going to favor because you're casting a wider net. Yeah. And then I also have guys that are like they have more niche channels and they'll go very deep in information where they'll scare away the beginner people. So they're they're casting a smaller net. However, the buying power these dudes have is [ __ ] [ __ ] Yeah. So that's that was kind of my next question is if you're not going for lifestyle it's not as much volume MR then you go to the mid-t high ticket stuff direct or they still come through MR cuz like in that example go to the extreme you have this like you know 10k channel instead of your 500k channel or whatever and you go crazy deep in info and education whatever it's not as much like are those buyers I mean they obviously are a different persona but are they buying the same thing productwise or do they generally come in for the 5 10k group coaching onetoone versus coming into just the trading chat and just hitting signals. Totally. So, I'll give you an examp I tweeted about this actually, so I'll talk about this. Um, so um one of the guys um he's um really deep like he he knows this stuff really deep like to the point where like you'll watch his videos, you won't understand what he's saying. That's that's deep. I love that. uh and uh in co he's blew up um for example and um you know acquired a ton of customers um I put like SQLs so like salesqualified leads for us so um they bought during Yeah. Yeah. So 17,000 people during that period. I'll tell you probably numbers more on I'll make maybe like private note but um on the unit price of that and stuff but it was it was you know it was crazy. And then up until now that like again because like he's not monetizing focused he just never sold to those people like since and they've been just sitting in like a community for 4 years and they just like he just he just like literally offered them the same service almost everyone else is offering but haven't hasn't charged him a dime. Right. And it got to a point where recently we were just like, dude, like you're just like at this point you're just like giving the other market the revenue that you could accumulate because people would happily pay you, right? Diminishing. Yeah. Yeah. Like so a lot of that like a brand like that. So here's the thing. Someone that's very base level with their trading knowledge like usually it's very hard for them to get deep because then you get really need to be really good at trading, right? That's something that I can't we can't control from a marketing side, right? But to someone that's goes very deep, you can reverse engineer that person to be a little bit more wider, right? But that person will need to figure out how to condense the information like Hermosi to explain the same stuff in a simpler net. But now if you could do both, now you're a black swan, right? Because that's interesting. You see what I mean? So yeah. No, 100%. Most guys in the space are hovering up here, right? Because they they can only go as depth as like how good of a trader or like knowledge they have or expertise in coaching. Yeah, there's very few that can go in this vertical which is very interesting to me. So there's a few that we we know and like we're partnered with, but those are guys that are like again like those those pieces on the chessboard that I don't see just you you can't just knock that off because it's not they're not staying afloat because of the lifestyle. They're not staying afloat because of XYZ. Like they're staying afloat because they could show up every day and they could do what they say they do, right? Just keep it real. Yeah. I'm telling you that's where in my brain I'm just like you need just black swan like trading like you're just your thing where you because especially I mean I don't know these people but like a lot of time that like archetype that style of human is someone who just wants to do that and just wants to stay in that and you do all the things around them which I mean I guess you're already doing but just having just the overarching like pin of all of those that's that's that's sick. So yeah, I was just going to say for us it's like you know finding like the more we go more I go on this journey for myself is just finding those brands and working with less but making essentially like scaling them further and that's the fun of it because why not like for myself I'm naturally like hey let's go to the next level. Um, but yeah, I think info just over the next like a lot of what we spend time on is like over like the future of it because I try to get it ahead of the curve because before the curve happens and I feel like for example like I think offer designing and product is something that's just really undermined and underlooked. It's not, you know, and I also think AI stepping in is going to like diminish a lot of products. And my like that's my hypothesis is like, yeah, you know, like I think to the average consumer right now, like they're using chat GPT as like a a voice assistant or like a text assistant. Like they don't know how to maximize it, right? Like I'm not sure like I I've seen your stuff like you're deep into the AI world. Uh I'm assuming and like at some level, but I see some of these guys and I'm like man am I not even close. Like I'll ask on X and people list these things and I go I'm like it's it's so crazy, right? But it's like it's getting to a point like for example like if I'm learning anything like I have chat GPT by my side and I'm learning with it, right? But the average person doesn't know how to do that yet. Like it's just not like a thing, right? Because most people just have the app and they're just conversating with it. So I think as it gets more and more advanced and the average consumer understands how to leverage it the right way, like why can't someone just be like, "Hey, I'm struggling in X, Y, and Z, for example, in trading, right? Here's my data for the last year. Make me a course that's designed for me. Yeah. Literally. And so, like, if you have nothing like if you have no IP, if you have no sort of like ecosystem, if you have no sort of like, you know, higher tail product where it's like back to those two things like customization and access, like those are going to be the things that people will keep paying for, right? Because like I think Hermoszi posted like he paid like Grant Cardone for like a quarter like for an hour a call. Like it was like a quarter million or something, but like why do that, right? Like it's like it's not I'm pretty sure Grant and he says it too. It's not like Grant gave him any sort of like key piece of information on that call. All he told him was like post 10 times. Yeah, I was going to say literally is like your feed versus my feed is the is the clip that stands out in my head. I know the exact video you're talking about, right? And and so it's like you know it's it's like so so I think like most offers are not building those ecosystems. There's one I won't name drop him but like a person I really respect in the space. you may have known him uh but like I I'll I'll tell you afterwards. Um but he's probably like I I buy a lot of courses because the best I became a better marketer by buying stuff. Yeah. Um like I've been through so many like in-person events and I try to see how they like try to sell you on like stuff and like how to do that. I became like just, you know, obsessed with that. And each time I went through those, like I've learned better and better. And I've seen and compared like the lowest tiers of like how people prop up their stuff and then it comes out to become a flop and then they're just shitty and it's fine, whatever. Like I already have like that sunk cost budget in my mind. But then there's like these other experiences I'll go through. I'm like, "Holy fuck." Like this is a buying experience that I enjoyed going through, right? And so like that to me is more entertaining. Like and that's why like I don't think in in our space specifically like anyone's been able to sell like a 15 to 30k package without getting like refunds uh and and returns on it. But I feel like there people would pay for that like especially in the latter we have like people just want more access to the founder. As long as we can figure out in a scalable format we could do it. I know for sure. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. So you the AI how do you the AI part is like and the machine part and where tech is how is there even a space for this I don't understand trading well enough but like how are you not trading I mean you already are trading against bots and what you know what I mean like how is there still room for human if like you know AI is the smartest thing ever when it comes to like the actual product that you guys sell and like the education and training how is that because that market right it was you know you hear quant you hear this stuff like that steady win, but you guys just still teach and use, you know, foundational methods that can still beat because, you know, it's it's player versus player at some level, right? Mhm. Yeah. I mean, I have no idea how this that's going to be more of like a trading centric focus question specifically, but I mean, I'll give you my take on it. I mean, I think it's heading there for sure, right? I've seen like the quants and like the AI stuff like most of them And this is just me hearing what other people say, like just don't really perform and do the best as as well as they claim. Um, but I know like some guys like especially like the ICP of like the doctors and the lawyers that just have like extra money laying around and they'll just pay for 20, 30, 40k for a bot and they'll be like like legit they're like I don't care if it works or not. Like [ __ ] it if it works. That's fine. I get to see it do it thing. Yeah. Legit they go like it's like it's like there's a there's a world like that's what the cool thing about trading. It's just there's a world of pockets of pockets of people. Yeah. And it just goes deeper and deeper the more you're in it. Um but essentially um I I think it is going to eventually become a thing. But it's like you know for example like the best way I I I look at this is like if you look at like AI and quant and stuff like these like big hedge funds like Bridgewater or like Radalia and all these dudes like they have their own proprietary stuff, right? Yeah. Why the hell would they just give that out to people, right? Think about that, right? Like if it's if it's working. So yeah, that was kind of my question is like that is where you take it. That is the how deep can you go? How far can who is, you know, does the person want to go or is the model even capable of going like Right. So I I I don't think like at least for the partners we have it's like that's been like not really it just also gets really sketchy with like the closer it gets to the sun for the FTC I usually I'm like hey like it's a gray if it feels if it feels gray area Yeah. Maybe there's a reason why it feels scary, right? So, I I like to not entertain those conversations as much. It's fun to, you know, go through and talk about because there's a demand. Like, trust me, because we just talked about this, the archetype of a of a trader specifically, people don't want to learn how to catch a fish. Uh, they just want you to catch a fish for them. And like I've seen like these bot companies and AI and you're probably familiar with maybe a few of like the heavy hitter ones maybe. I'm not too sure how how deep you're into that world, but um you know, they're just like people like just throw themselves to that type of offer because it's kind of like it's like the no-brainer offer like hey, we're going to give you this magical tool that's going to print you money like right like I could just see FTC written all over that and you know what I mean? So like there's just a level of like and and that goes back to the question of like how deep you want to play this game, you know? like I don't know if I want to play that game being being honest with you myself, right? Um but I I think there's always going to be room for like access and customization to like right like because especially with like I can't say for paid but like if you have an organic cult of people like they just want to spend time with you. Exactly. They just Yeah. They're asking to buy something from like what you said that guy that just has a community of four you know for four years. It's like they they're they're wanting him to say something. Exactly. Exactly. So I think that's the power in like having a really great organic brand. And I think that's also why it's such a powerhouse to not dilute your brand and [ __ ] it up in in like 2 3 years because like I don't see many brands like back to your question about this like I don't see many brands in our space like they'll have their run. They'll be new, they're hot, their content's flying, they usually just get comfortable, right? They get lazy. They don't expect they think that everything's always going to be rainbows and sunshines, right? Um we're always going to be doing half a million a million months, right? But that just might be like a six-month run you have and then it's like right. Um but but ultimately it's like I'm I I enjoy longevity. Like that's something I I'm like even for myself I'm just like well how do we stay within? We've been we've been doing this since like 2017 and like each time like we've dealt with so many like moments like I don't know if you saw like Top Gun of like that movie like the the like I've dealt with so many of those where it's like literally things change overnight. You've probably dealt with maybe some similar scenarios where it's like everything [ __ ] breaks. Shit's hitting the [ __ ] wall. Yeah. We got to figure out we got to throw money at advisors, coaches, programs like figure out how to fix this thing without bleeding out as much. And for us, we're again, we're less cost, so we don't have much bleeding, right? But it's like still like how do you pivot this boat and machine? Um, and many people just aren't willing to pivot. Like that's or Yeah. It's still bleeding when you're bleeding from the norm. It's just not, you know, coming out of pocket. It's coming out of what would have been in pocket, which is the same thing at a certain point. Exactly. Especially when there's consistent numbers. So, okay. So, what is your because I think about this all the time. I get especially now. So, I started doing this for literally just to meet cool people, do all this and it's like and it's working and it's hilarious. My goal is three to five. I'm talking to whatever and you know I talked to Iman. I bought Iman's thing talking about you know buying guru course whatever. I buy everything. So I buy that. I'm like cool. Talked to in the beginning he's like yeah if you get three to five on X three to five on YouTube have like this consumption you can make a couple million bucks a year just doing like side deals and then you know run the main thing. And I'm like okay. And now I'm like okay I don't want to accept anything. I'm like not you know it's consulting deals or it's opportunities or it's part of this or part of that and I'm like no and because and this is where I'm curious you know I can learn from you is what does the deployment team look like because the last thing I need is to spread focus which anything I do will do that but in current state it would be like focus plus time it would be like time and clicking keys it would be because that's like my leverage in that is very very low. I've never had an EA I've never had like a skeleton team in that way. I've always done it and then I have team of course inside the like main code. Yeah. that now. But that's just that it's like I don't have a deployable and I quote, right, like team where you can have this person come in and I know it's kind of more agencyish, but like it's also kind of holding co style and I know guys who do this with home services, you know, hormone does this with info with every and SAS and franchise, but what does the stack look like of who you like deploy and like how do you I don't want to say like start that because it's a little different starting it I'm sure, but like you break them off by KPI. guys. You have three to five guys. You have 30 guy like guys and gals. Like what's your structure? So are are you saying like what for you for now as now zooming out to you because we just kind of spent a lot of the time like in the actual Yeah. Yeah. your clients or like how their model works their monetization whatever your so far we've covered with yours is like your monetization is generally speaking and call it revshare simply put. Sure. But how do you So right now you have four new people that come to you. You vet them. You go through your thing. you know, one of them's what you categorize as black swan, two of them, whatever. What is the team stack? What is your structure to deploy into there? Cuz you said you're going to go a toz, but like is that a lot of you? Is that like how do these other ones continue to run? Like I envy that. That's amazing. I have one thing, you know? Yeah. So, I'd say we have a pretty lean team. Um, right. Like we're like we have like bunch of different contractors and some VAS helping with stuff like that. But um really I'd say like I'm the and this is where I'm trying to get better at myself is like um hiring dude stuck in the weeds. Right. Exactly. Because I enjoy what I do. Like like I genuinely rap about like I'll jump on like I said I'll jump on calls for free with people. Like I don't care. It's also like I learn so much by just talking to people about like you're doing that much in that audience. Like what the [ __ ] you doing like what are you doing right? Like you know what I mean like or so or vice versa. So, um, that that's a part of it that I think is cool, but I I do see that like, hey, like there's opportunity cost in like me being stuck in the weeds as well, right? Um, so I think the one key thing that's been super huge for us to do this is um, we have like a head of operations person um, that I basically like built from the ground up and this was like I think we hired him about 3 four years ago and he was just like a web developer at the time and um, overseas too and um, I legit it would be like me doing my like regular like wake up, do your deep work meetings, all of that and then my I guess six to 10 if you want to call it would be like jump on a Zoom call with this dude for like two years straight and like literally like it was it's I don't know if you heard that Mr. beast story of like yeah shadow yeah and and he's like because his main focus is like tech and ops and AI like he loves that stuff and he genuinely enjoys building too like he's been a great great great great like sidekick in terms of like I'm very heavy strategy and all I have to do is like hey we're deploying this you can go hire the team you want don't let me deal with that because I don't want to even think about like how to structure the ops do the thing. Here's the KPIs. Here's where we need to get to. Here's the boundaries that we got to stay within and the lines we can't cross. Let's go deploy. Right? And so the thing is we've done it so many times now that like I I wouldn't want to say there's a SOP because everything's really tailored. It's like a fitted suit that we're putting on. You know what I mean? So like there's like a we got the cloth ready, right? like we have it but then when it comes to the tailoring element like that's where it will require a little bit more functioning from his side and my side from the strategy component but that's been I think bottom line I see this across like a lot of like different I speak to agency owners and stuff like that like they struggle with that a lot like the operations a lot curious is because it's it's not easy especially when you're doing it how you are it has to be it's boutique at some level and it has to it's the it's the people it's who you deploy like how they Exactly. That's a cool structure though. So, so he's he's the backbone of a lot of that and then he has people underneath him like he has a like a whole like house of people that he's just hired to like you know you're doing this project, you're doing this, you're doing this. We meet like a few times throughout the week just pulse checks every every weekend. Like my weekends are pretty much meetings with him and like the other team and just like making sure like projects are in check, timelines are in check, if I change anything in the strategy. So I again I'm I am very strategy focused right now but um even like sales focused like um because like I told you like when we were doing launches like so I guess we we didn't touch on this a little bit but like from we did nothing tactical no but we did no we did a lot of the model and structure which is I think extremely val and I think it's also more valuable to somebody who is at kind of what ideally the target market is because like understanding the different monetization models understanding the different like tr levers you can pull and what you are pulling I think is maybe more valuable but like I want to hear it let's hear the challenges let's hear the launches so so launches were like we went on so maybe you're familiar with like cohort based courses and stuff so that's how I kind of like I started following these few dudes on Twitter I'll name drop them because I never worked with them but they were like a huge inspiration for this uh so I don't know if you these names ring a bell Thiago Forte David Pell Ali Abdal yes Ali Abdal so uh they were running these cohort based courses like around the co time and also you got to understand like co everyone's at home like people were throwing money at info right and especially cohorts were like I wouldn't want to say we pioneered it for trading but we brought it over for trading because no one was really doing it at the time so I was like how do you go from just selling a course to like something more tangible it's like okay let's do a cohort based course so there was no salespeople no DM setters it was just email marketing and it'd be like a 60-day long marketing runway list to application bunch of emails great copywriting building demand, building hype, all of that. Um, and we like there was like there's one like study like case study I guess we have. It's to me probably one of the mo my f most favorites because he was so small but he did so many big numbers. So he had like less than 10,000 subscribers on his email list. His audience on like socials was pretty small as well. Uh but like we've done we did about I think close to 15 cohorts within a span of like two years and that netted about like six 7 million right which isn't like like it's like when we compared like the big numbers it's like but like still though it's so sizable that is so sizable right but it's like but the efficiency of it was just beautiful to me right um that you could be so small but if you have a really cultlike audience and you can really position position yourself well to create the demand and a great product and deliver it. You can go really far with it, right? Um then obviously like we did the cohort run for a lot of trading guys like we did like upwards like it went to almost like 1.5 in a day like on a launch with no sales team, no setters. This was like and what so what's the exact structure of it or like what is the offer and then priceish? It's like um so the high so that one particular the one I just mentioned was like uh offer was like a four-week live course. um you get like a community access right after and then there'll be like events that they'll get like invited to and stuff like that. It was pretty like a simple like offer four weeks live course pretty much. Uh and then the ticket price was I believe 5k for that. Like so we were showing like 5k links in the email and people would be buying like it's crazy. Um and that was the highest that that was the peak and this was what am I doing wrong? This is this was but those are the good old days like forget about them. It's not it doesn't happen anymore. Uh, you so that's like that was 2022. Um, and then 2023 is when I saw those launches going from that to uh-oh, this launch not producing the same conversions as it was. Then we did it again and we pushed it and this time we pushed up the intensity of the launch, doing more webinars before them, challenges before it, but it's like the amount of work it took to get the same number that we were doing before got harder. Yeah. So that to me was like, uhoh. Yeah. signal abort like you know this fighter jet's going down if you don't pick it back up right and so then that's when setter closer models were like really popping off and then so we had to pivot and so the hardest part was actually this is funny so our partners got so conditioned to being spoiled with like high margins and then all of a sudden you know we're like hey you're going to need to pivot and they're just like what do you mean like we're doing great and I'm like yeah for now but like this this plane's going to crash if you freaking and don't like pull the plug. And no one wants to pull a plug on like when you're doing launches and and they were still doing like like 400 half a million close to like you know like they were doing like it was it was solid for like you know the structure it was but it was declining and I'm like that's always a sign of like pick up your bags before it's too late. Yeah. And so some of them pivoted, some of them weren't, you know, they just weren't like they were like just you know hard-headed and they're just like hey like no this is good like I'm not going to go hire a sales team now. Yeah. Right. And so I'm, you know, that's where we just had to kind of draw the line where we're like, hey, like if you're not willing to evolve, and that's where the partnership and selection process comes in is like, you know, to each to their own, no judgment, but again, like I'm I'm not I'm not we're not going down in this plane, right? Like we we'll let you we'll make our case and if that if that's not the way you want to go about it, it's your business, it's your brand, we're not going to force anything, but if you want to stay longer, this is the move to go, right? So some of them we positioned and shifted really well, but that was a shift whole thing, right? So because we literally had to like shift that model, turn the whole thing around and like plug in this new system. Uh and then like you know now even like the setter closer model is getting to a point where it's it it's and people aren't and that's the other thing too. I feel like in our industry like many operators, agency owners and stuff like they don't realize like there's there's always going to be an end to it. uh like waves come and go and I think being part of like multiple different cycles and learning it the hard way because you face it fa and head on and you're just like well [ __ ] like this is going to suck for like six months to a year which was like literally a lot of 2023 and 2024 was like [ __ ] who do we pay to learn this the fastest way like what rooms do we get into like how do we evolve and get up to speed with [ __ ] that's moving and it's like once you build the cushion it's like take the cushion and run with it like add another layer of a cushion and start preparing for 2026, 2027 because this stuff I think is going to change a lot. I think the way people are selling is changing a lot on sales calls. We're not we're noticing it especially for Sorry, this is going deep into like the I love it. Yeah, I'm learning so much. I Yeah, this is great. So, even with like for example like I'll I'll talk about sales team specifics, right? like we're running offers and because they're organic brands, we can't sell and do sales processes that everyone else is doing in the market. Like Cole Gordon, love him and like all the stuff that he preaches like like all these guys like I think there that stuff works. But then when you try to bring that exact stuff over to organic at this scale, it becomes really difficult because audiences feel this repellent like it's like that car. Yeah. Like that hard Yeah. Like hard clothes style. You mean like and so so Exactly. So I have so like when we were recruiting initially like I we poached like some of the top closing talent and they just [ __ ] the bed when it came to selling here and I was losing my mind because I'm like you've done great here like why can't you you know what I mean? And so then I got the further I got into the space and I realized the archetypes of like the ideal sales profile of like even your closer right needs to be aligned with like and I think you guys like warrior babe like I you know I was actually at um sales con and you guys had like the whole table and I as soon as I saw the table I was like yep that's that's that's that's them right. But it's like you you if if like even for like a a regular fitness offer though, like if I'm a scrawny ass dude on a sales call, right, and I'm trying to pitch you to be buff, like it's just kind of work. Yeah. There's like simple ways to look at it like that. And then there's like, you know, stuff that's the archetype thing is it's real. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's real. But the the source of the lead is real. The It's It's deep. It's deep. So, we had to we had to like, you know, dial down those aggressive closers because they were used to hard selling, tie downs, like all that stuff, and it just didn't work. So, then it's like, well, okay, like how do we we like legit, this is funny because um like we launched an offer um a new one, and it was like this hardcore sales guy, and I this guy, this dude crushed like he's been in the game for like almost a decade. I've known him, track record, everything. Like, he's good. Uh, and I bring him over and like that day we get like five like negative Trust Pilot reviews. Uh, because like how hard he was selling, right? And, you know, I stayed up all night because he was like in Europe and I was like, "Dude, if you get another Trust Pilot review, like I can't I got to put you I got to I can't I can't vouch for you. Like, I know you're good. I've seen your record on other stuff, but like we can't do this." So, he's like, "What do you want me to do?" And I I kid you not, I was like, "Don't pitch. Whatever you do today, just don't sell at the end of it." Yeah. And he got like, I think five pisss that day. Like it it worked. And he's just like, "What the [ __ ] just happened?" And so, like, at that point, it's like, okay, like you start to realize that especially for us, you see how tailored it becomes because it's not it's to the brand that we have to favor. Even if it's in the same niche of trading, like one brand could be so different than others in terms of like the perception of like how the face comes off of Yeah. Right. So, we need the people to embody the same kind of format of discussion or it's not going to work, right? And so, it's it's crazy. It's so interesting. Yeah. We haven't had like the change of uh that because ours is I mean we're 90 whatever 8% paid. Yeah. Like so we don't have even though we have so much organic ours all sits middle and like acts as moat and trust builder and like gets it over the finish line and you know gets that that consumption side but when it comes to like actual like initial click it is paid like we just hammer it. Yeah. So ours is almost for a long time was the opposite. It was like they're too and this is again no offense at anyone and like doing that but like it was more it was a softer approach that is how we sold. Yeah. And it almost needs to go the other way to be more like that to like reenter it and find its way back. Yeah. But now that we're doing that, you know, same lead flow, same volume, same whatever. And it's double the units 100%. Day over day, day over day, day over day. And now it's like, you know, 10 days into that happening since we shifted that up like literally right now. And it's like [ __ ] like you know back to 100 150 whatever a day just like steady state all high ticket all whatever. So it's like knowing that is such a super. So like you just go to sales con like that's so so what are you doing there? I I you just go to things. Yeah. So yeah, I do go to a lot of things. Yeah. No, I I respect it. I like it. I mean Yeah. Yeah. I no matter how big, small, those guys that ran it, I'm I'm pretty close with them. They're pretty good group of guys. Um and um just like I try not to go in all the rooms. Like I try to be pretentious. So like like my mind's like I feel like learning is a skill in itself, right? And it's like you learn from the wrong people, you could poison that well that you have here. And so like I like I will try to like listen to like those deep podcasts with like only a hundred views and then they'll mention like a name or two and then I'll Google that name and they have zero they have zero views. Yeah. Like those are the real guys, right? And so I mean you know there's there's there's a few people on that stage and stuff that were pretty cool. So I it's it's it was cool because at least for there it was like people there was closers and setters all the way up to like business owners and then you guys were there too. I mean, you weren't there, but like I think your team was there. Yeah. So, it was just like a wide it was like a wide range of like just people, but it it was just good to like just switch. I like to just switch it up like especially when I'm in a rut like go like so like you know you learn you shake a lot of hands, you meet people, it changes your beliefs like it, you know, I share it a lot like also because like I feel like and not to just try to toot our horn or anything but it's like the way we're doing stuff is just very like different and like in its own bubble in a sense, right? And so it's like I I want to figure out like how do we make this better or like how do we like influence and like just learn from other people to just keep this thing like becoming more unique and like you know growing it. So um I'm I'm always like on like I'm figuring it out and I'm just like even right now I'm like like each year I've just learned more and more. So it's like you never really figure it out. You know what I mean? It's just like and you just never know like like you said there's some people that were there that were just so good at DM setting and like that was one area that I'm just like talk to me through that. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Who who can I pay to literally implement and teach me? Yeah. Implement it so we get the skill so we get the result now. But teach me so I don't need you. Yeah. Exactly. So it's like you know that that's that's a part of it but you know it's it's it's given but I'm on like day 70. I don't even know what I'm on on this. Like 68 70 in a row of making these. And that is my biggest not the time is hard like the structuring of that. But what the biggest thing around the like spewing versus learning like output versus input is crushing me and I and people hear it and say it and whatever. They'll be like oh like you're just you know in the last couple you talk too much or you do this and it's like cuz I'm just in that mode of just like here's everything I know and like I try and be like this is really like not ego. I'm not trying to sell anyone anything. I'm not trying to say this is the only way. This is what we've done. This is what worked. This is what hasn't. Here's what we're doing now. Like straight up. Yeah. But it has put me in such a different frame that I like almost need to like pull out of. And that's why I'm happy I'm doing these. And this one with you has been the best example of where I can like go back into absorption. All I did for the last 10 years is listen to things 18 hours a day about other people talking. I've heard every single Horoszi video. I've heard every single Cole Gordon thing. I've heard every single like any of these guys. I've paid everything. Every Eman course. And I just am like and then we implement. We learn our own structure of it and then we go. But I don't ever talk about it. I don't ever share it, anything. And now all I'm doing is like spewing and not taking in anything. And it's like crushing me a little cuz I'm like, what am I missing right now? What am I learning? I know I don't know about AI. I don't know. Half the stuff you're talking about like is so like new to me. And the structure and like the margins is so foreign. So this is great. This is like Yeah. I mean, you can always learn. So likewise. Likewise. All right. So let's hit the Twitter questions. Uh, I have two or three that I see and there might be more, but I don't know how to navigate X very well. So, the Where do you see the future of info in the next three to five? Okay. I think we hinted on it a little bit with like AI kind of stepping in. Yep. But I think um more tailored, more customization, more access, like if you can figure out how to put that into a scalable version, I think that is going to be the denominator. I also think actually one thing that I've noticed do really well and not for many communities because it's been really hard to do is like the communities that sell themselves like meaning like you go into an ecosystem and you go into an environment where the the client success and the acquisition within it is like automated, right? Like because you jump into this fire and everyone's like, "Hey, like have have you seen what they did in this?" And it's like internally and I love that because it's like you know it's kind of like Tesla. It's like every for every like I think you know three cars they sell it's like one of them comes from like referrals or word of mouth right and it's like how do you implement that in e-learning or like our space? It's like you got to have a thriving ecosystem to do that. It's got to be a good community. You got to have good that I don't think there's a lot of emphasis being put on those things because it's like okay tactics. How do you get a high show rate close rate? Like let's and I get that too. Like that's fun stuff. But then again, my like strengths have has have always been how do we play this more efficiently? How do we work smarter not harder? Like we'll work hard too, but like why not beat people at the game of this, right? Like how do we how do we do stuff that like moes within the business? And like that to me, I joined one and I'll share this with you after like in Twitter. We'll probably send you a DM, but like there's one company that did it really really well. Like I went through that buying experience and it was so crazy to me because they got me hooked. Like it was like [ __ ] like I'm in, right? Like give me like here's my credit card. Like I'm like, sell me this thing. But when I got through it myself and I'm just like, wow, it they didn't even pitch me. It was the community within it that kind of got me through. And so I think if you can format that and build that, I think it's not going to be like a return right away. Yeah. Well, that's that's the game, right? But like it it's going to be one of those strategies that are going to keep you like 6 months and 12 months. It'll compound. a lot and the the the rippling effect of that is crazy, right? And so I I think that's part partly one of the things and I think again in person is going to take a big swing. I think like those that can implement it the right way. Um I remember Sam Ovens, you probably know Sam Ovens, right? Like his dude I bet my that's how I joined this company was from the community of one of the paid courses. One of the co-founders posted something clicked into his profile. He was looking to bring on basically the right-hand thing what you were talking about like shadow me style. Yeah. And I came in through that and then now we're here. Yeah. Holy [ __ ] Because that was my start too. Like he was the first program I took into this marketing world. So um crazy but key everyone saw us buy everything. Sam Ovens, right? But um essentially like he was running those quantum masterminds at the time. Like I don't know if you saw that but like those were big ticket freaking things at the time too. And I think like he did a great job of of doing those. Only thing that was missing was I feel like there was no automated structure around it where I was like he needed to be present but there was no like automated way to keep selling it unless there was like an event booked and then you got to fill out the seats and that to me is inefficient. Like why not have more of a revolving like structure? So we kind of I I borrowed it from the experience I went through. Uh, but they have a really great automated way to do in-person events. And that was the selling point for me, right? Because I didn't pay for more. I I didn't need more information technically. Like I I I'll take information, but like I'd be I'll be very specific with like what I want to feed my brain. Um, but it was access. It's like how do I just get in a room of people that just do this like day and night and just sleep, eat, sleep info and like marketing and like all that stuff, right? And that was cool to me. So when I saw that for myself and I saw it within other people and that's where I think it's going. So I think if you can make it AI proof and not be if you if you're if you could be replaced by AI like your e-learning business, I could just go and create a course for myself. Um I think you're in a very fragile point. Yeah, I would agree. Interesting. Okay. Uh so that's where I'm curious now. This is not a question on here, but where do you see your structure in three? Five is extended my mind. Maybe you maybe you think that far. I can't think that far. Three is even kind of crazy, but like where do you see this situation in three if you have, you know, is it more client load? Is it scaling the current ones? Is it you're done because you made 50 and you're calling it? Is it I mean, I mean, people have different ambitions and you know, I never asked aged or location or desire, but like that's real. If you're if you can put away and you know you're living in a zero zone, that's plenty. So So I think for me, um I definitely like to take some of those deep guys that I mentioned, um I take that as a personal challenge to make guys that are lesser known but so well at their craft and turn them into like those are guys that I think can sling very far, but they will need to kind of like reverse engineer a lot of the way they think. And I think, you know, I would like to have only one, two, maybe three at max people that are doing like 50 to 100 under our belt and we're like at that point just partnered. Like we're just that's that's it. Like we work with you, we keep scaling that and we can just let that cash flow. But I think the player play for me at least I I feel like will be SAS most likely. Um just using this as a stepping stone into the tech world. um a buddy of mine, same guy you probably know, like he made that venture and it's it's it's definitely like not like the same world and it's very very challenging. It doesn't look easy. Yeah. Um it it sounds cool. It's like hey, but it's like I also like the reason why I've been so hesitant with that like that's what I feel like is my direction, but I I want a big enough problem to solve, not something that could just be like a a rapper over AI, right? or like some like quick software that's going to get like you know like something legit like and within our space like you you you know it like there's so many problems but like are they worthy of you building an entire solution around right so I that's that's my thing like in terms of three years trajectory it's like continue blowing this up meeting cool people networking like just you know seeing where things take us really but I think in terms of those brands and those partners like we I think hitting that nine figure scale would be cool. Yeah. Um and then yeah, we'll let see where things go. Yeah, that's Yeah. No, that's similar to ours. I mean, we are just gonna lean in hard and ours transitions out of info and coaching at scale, but like even then it doesn't act like it's not even true. It it has additional line items that come in to play once the info and coaching is big enough because the TAM is just so large. But do those are these exitable at all? Like are there is there even like a buyer pool for that? I mean again in info and coaching in general to be clear like I understand that us saying or thinking that we could or might in two to five let's say is a 0.001%. And I understand that but like are there ones that do I I mean personally I haven't gone through an exit myself. Yeah. Yeah. me. So, I I I don't I know it's very hard and especially it's I I don't think if if there is an exit for any of the partners we work with, I don't think it's going to be the entire like the company that someone would buy. I think it'd be more so the data. Interesting. Yeah, because that was the question, right? That's also like back to the depth thing. It's like the person who's the next layer of depth is the one who would be interested even in buying, right? Is because it's like they don't have to do this portion because they already are playing this bigger game of they're a broker. I don't know. again again like our broker they're funded this or whatever and they're buying the access the community exactly like they could they could leverage that like I could see that being a play and a benefit for those type of branded partnership companies right so I again it's just I feel like unless they pay a salary for the for the founder and the face because that's the problem right it's like yeah it's a huge problem that's been info and coaching demise yeah right so it's like that's the thing so it's like I I don't think like many companies obviously build for like I think you guys like I saw I've seen your like building towards like the enterprise value and stuff and like W2 employees and like all that like most companies don't even think about that or touch that right so it's like I think that does come down to like I think first for some of these guys is like hey prove the concept of like you can get to like the eight figure level right once you cross that threshold I think then it makes sense to have a conversation about that before then I think you're just kind of delusional right so yeah no yeah it's it's still delusional by the way we are delusional right now I We were doing we were acting in a way of like like you know hearsay on how to get this to a place where it could sell everything down to like oh your entire sales team used to be W2 when like your sales team didn't need to be W2 then they were not operating in a way that they were like employee like you know the legality of it of like 1099 versus W2 and like you know are they telling them what to do you have these strict hours they have to follow whatever it's like we weren't even doing that and to move them over is the 20% hiking costs and then the base floor so people aren't who aren't hitting like it was such a costly mistake. Yeah. And that is just one simple example of like we eat so much margin because we are preparing for a time that when and if and like versus these other guys you know right I mean think about it you would get rid of if you're trying to team stack up and you don't want founder risk you need founder risk gone on marketing and fulfillment and then the entire actual operations of the company need to be run by not you more or less and everything needs to be clean with it and and and and then you know as a business as a whole it just needs to be like up and to the right more or less simply you if you want the good numbers. 100%. 100%. And that's not common to do any of that. So, and you eat margin on the way. Not at all. Not at all. I I mean, I've heard stories from like our good friends. I think you're you're good friends with WAP and and those guys. Yeah. Hunter like Hunter's like big dog. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hunter's big dog. Um so like they I've heard stories from them about like not many exits but like a few. Maybe there maybe you guys have talked about it or not but like u again I think it was around data like they told they shared a story with me um it was about like yeah that's what the VC just guy just saw the data appealing and he was like [ __ ] it I'll pay for this thing. Yeah he didn't care about the course he didn't care about the space he didn't care about anything else. So I I see it but it's just it's very hard very a completely different game. It's the yeah it's that depth thing. Um all right what else we got in here? What are we at? Oh look at us. An hour and a half. Um, boom. What's the best The longest that you've done this, by the way. Sorry. Yesterday. 2 hours. Damn. Okay. So, usually it's just an hour. I just slot off an hour. I mean, me even saying usually is dumb because this is like a third or fourth one. This is the most inter I'm everyone's going to say here. First of all, anyone who's this far, comment 1.5. We did this yesterday and I'm just curious. Um, but comment 1.5. But this is more interviewy style. So, I'm curious to see what people like more or not because thus far it's been like trench talk random. I'm sitting there, you know, by a fire pit with a coffee and chilling with somebody basically conversation. This is kind of like that, but a little bit more like in a good way, like I'm learning from you. I'm asking a lot in that way. So, I'm interested. This is the peel back the curtain a little bit because, you know, I think that will bode better for the future of this anyway. Is like I just want to be raw with this. There's no fancy anything. But, all right. Questionwise, what's the best funnel strategy? So you said initially it was you've gone through a couple different iterations of when it was you know 2017 then COVID range then now. So like what is the one that basically is running now? It's organic YouTube to MR pretty much that's the one that's cooking the most. And you guys are just sending to the exact stack is you sending to like literally like W pages and they're joined through Mr. there. Yeah through W and usually with traders have this obsession with Discord. I don't know if you're like a big Discord user, but like traders, but yeah, that's traders like if you're a trader and usually here's the other thing. I don't want to go too deep into this can be a whole other thing, but but traders archetype is like they don't just buy from one person. They don't like I've seen overlaps and there's overlaps and like the what I tell like partners and stuff like the pie is big enough for everyone because traders will it they're if you look at their instinctive personality, they're gamblers. Yes. The ones that don't know how to trade like you know it's it's gambling but like it's not gambling because it's called trading, right? But because it's called trading. Yeah. The difference. But if that wasn't it. Yeah. And you don't know what you're doing in the market. You're gambling, right? So if you look at their natural tendency and you look towards that, it's like they keep buying different stuff. So like most like if you look at the archetypes, most of them are either in like multiple different discourse and they like to have them buzzing around and like stuff like that. So, I mean to keep it short though, yeah, YouTube usually put traffic, try to accumulate as much of that as you can. Um, and obviously the content itself is actually really important too. Like we talked about like if you do the lifestyle stuff, cool. It's probably not going to move the needle. Not anymore. That's just a trend trend I'm seeing on YouTube, on Instagram, on any platform. It it's brand awareness pretty much it. Um, and and again, it's more brand awareness from like the other gurus in the space. Yeah. They're trying to cop see like, oh, you got that car, you know, competing with the other guy, trying to do the same thing to win the same rate. Yeah. But the audience just doesn't really care, right? Um, and so that's interesting feedback. Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's like um you know for that it's like if you can have a YouTube channel that's solely based that grows solely based on value and you don't have to do some extracurricular stuff to get the views that means you have something really powerful right so my signal to everyone like I think Ravi Abuala talks about it a lot too is like YouTube YouTube YouTube it is a like you don't need a huge volume but trading is one of those niches that I think you can open up it's such a big TAM so you can make content that reaches is millions of people, right? So, like legit like we have like one organic VSSL that we posted on YouTube and it doesn't come across like a VSSL, but it's like an hour and 50 minutes, something like that. And we have like the pitch to the program, like the high ticket, like that's the only place you're going to find it. It's like right towards the end, right? And so, it's like only if you make it to the end of it, you're going to find it out. And that's hit like almost 300k views. 400k views paid to acquire customer. Yeah, exactly. And then like on on that video alone is like well we'll do like a weight list and like again like when I was telling people traditionally like we do weight list they're like our weight lists don't work anymore. I'm like sure but then you do what we do like we cook with weight lists right? Uh because the segmentation and everything's so [ __ ] dialed in and like we said like we make you earn the way to the VSSL the actual VSSL. So that's that alone produced like I think in like last 90 days probably like close to like 1.5 too, right? Um so and from one video, right? So it's like if we just move the CTA just a little bit more this way. Yeah. And we rinse and repeat and it's working and but I I don't think it's going to be working forever for for right now. Like it's it's a it's a thing that's going heavy right now. I think just cracking the YouTube code in its own self is like every channel is really uniquely different. Yeah. I don't know what it is to it, but it's like the thumbnails, the titles, the hooks, and all that. You're in this YouTube world, so maybe you've kind of that, maybe not. But it's happen to be hosted here instead of Wistia. It has nothing to do with anything different. Exactly. No, no. The my my reach and my acquisition is not even a thing. This is a video hosting platform for me. And if people decide to go there, it's like going to a website. And so so that's that's I guess for us like the one thing that we don't really do is like, hey, like we'll help you get more traffic. I was just going to say that. Is there a point of or a partnership, an opportunity something where you can break off something with one of these guy? There's so many of them now and of course you got to sift through, but like wouldn't that be so valuable to you? Yeah. So we do kind of in a way I can't talk too much about it, but like we do have that um to a degree. Like here's the thing. I'm in the YouTube world myself like like I've seen it and witnessed like what some channels have grown super well that of partners that we've seen and it's like just them doing it and I've learned from them doing it not from like anything we've advise them on. So I've I've gotten a good like my I have a good pallet of like I can see what could work and what doesn't. So I can advise to a degree of like I know this video would crush for you and this video probably wouldn't. Um, but like in terms of like expertise of like making the arrow in the thumbnail like that and like titling it this way and like that's not that's just like at that point I will call it quits if I had to do that because like we're already doing so much. So at the very least we're just like hey be good at content when you come to us, right? So like again that's like a checklisting item for us is like hey do you know how to consistently get views on your own? Right? And if you do that's more of a powerhouse. If not cool. If there's an opportunity big enough, then we'll connect you with the right people. Yeah. You can connect with YouTube strategists, you thumbnail guys, you can do that. Yeah. To get it going. So again, but yeah, YouTube's YouTube's a gold mine right now. um if you dial it in properly and you segment the right audience and and here's the other thing too like the bigger the channels grow the more global you get the more buying power gets reduced too because then you start tapping into especially with trading it's like you go into the I'm I'm brown so I can make fun of my own people in a way too so it's like you go into those markets the buying power kind of like you know decreases a bit um and and there's I've seen guys that also crush it in those markets too right it's it's crazy yeah I know affiliate guys that for the longest time were like the US, Canada style. It's like whatever the big four style for all of their paid and these are you're talk I'm talking like raw affiliate lander like ad to lander to clickbank link like style and they forever were cranking that and they completely pivoted to everything but those markets you know cost per click is this and instead of selling the supplements the whatever they're doing like these clickbanky info products and style and just crank they but it's so much volume of everything units because you're selling a $20 thing, but your cost per click is like, you know, cents versus your $2 like spread. But yeah, if you hit it, you hit it. Same with the Shopify and the ecom guys, especially when they do fulfillment that's from those other countries, too. It's like they do only traffic there and then only fulfillment there. So like you have that even if you don't live there, like 100%. Yeah, it's a volume game. Yeah, volume game with with those markets, right? But it's like um Yeah, you know, it's it's it's fascinating for sure. But I I think um yes, just answering back to the question um funnel's working right now. I think uh YouTube low ticket monthly subscription and and here's the other thing too again on low ticket. So something I recognize like monthly subscriptions like for trading are are very sticky, right? Because you kind of have to keep paying to keep getting like the new information on a day-to-day basis. Whereas in like for example like you're in the fitness space like a low ticket there like in my opinion recurring models are one of the hardest models to do. Yeah. We don't even have one. It wouldn't make sense because why would someone pay over and over again for for something unless it's like really No. Yeah. I mean there there are people that crush it or there are people that do enough volume that the churn isn't as big of an issue, right? And it's like because we're all paid not organic. It's literally the LTV to Cat game and like what is the math? And it's just we never since we went high ticket, we've stayed high ticket. Exactly. And it doesn't make sense, right? But then again with trading, it's like it it just works because of the domain that it's in. Yeah. Right. But then I in in other niches like I've seen just like hey like straight like like a book offer or like you know like those small you know event challenges and like those paid event stuff and like all of that. Um that's like worked as well too. So I think it's just you got to be really particular about the load t. I know we talked about MR a lot about this. I just want to put like a disclaimer to people like in a sense like you could try it like it's fine but it's just you got to like like we've tailored everything to the like we know the archetype of this niche so so well which is why we've been able to like be so deep in it and and maximize it. So I think you just got to lean into your strength. So like that's the main thing I'd say for like when you're designing the low ticket. Um, but yeah, then it's like if if you can build a back-end ascension where it doesn't again because these are organic customers, you can't sell them the same way you're selling to everyone else. If you can build a C because the customer journey for us never ends with the low ticket obviously. Yeah. That's just a that's just you hit the first checkpoint, right? And so like then we're put putting you through like assessment quizzes and more segmentation and it's like okay come through here. We want you to do like an implementation calls and like there's like a lot of like stuff that goes on in the back scenes of that to get you know the the metric that we try to optimize for is like it takes someone um let's just say when they from the moment they join low ticket to when they join high ticket like let's just say it's 150 days like the cycle right and so it's like how do we organically reduce that cycle over time right um and that journey and so the more efficient that journey becomes the cycle becomes less and less and I mean I haven't seen that many cycles go like with under 90 days like it's really hard to do that uh especially paid I think is like I've seen like 150 days to like you know products from like zero to like 30k you probably you're smiling you probably have like your own rocking I'm rocking like four right now right yeah ours is yeah because we're not but we're not doing it in the same way so are you guys are going direct to Okay, first of all, you have organic. Your I your whole model is like I'm like what am I doing? Um but the organic is such a powerhouse and it is something that is that I'm doubling going to double triple quadruple down into the going into MR play. I think there is room for it. It's how do we service it? It's how do we make sure it's valuable enough that it doesn't you know cannibalize backend offers. That's a big thing for us is making sure that the offer stack does not cannibalize itself in some way. But for us, low ticket right now is one thing with no upsells. No, cuz in our industry and space a lot of the time it's upsells, it's crossell, it's however we can do that to get it. So your $100 cost per acquisition is offset completely or profitable. And for us, that's not our target. Ours is instead post purchase they hit uh ascension. So it's they get directly on the phone with a setter. Yeah. Yeah. So the timetable though, that's the difference in the timetable. Yeah. It's like it's the economics and the timetable difference because now I have someone on the phone within 24 to 48 hours here and then again within 48 hours here. So my average like true buy time if you're from this to this is 4 days. Yeah. Yeah. And the ascension rate right now is like single digits but like good. Like I mean again if you're doing a $100 cost per net cost per acquisition, it cost you 150 and your product's 50. So, you know, it's 100 to get them to the next step. 100%. And 5% of them do that. You know, like you're in a couple low thousand CPA on something that's 5 10 like for us that makes sense to do. For sure. And and and and again for us like it just comes back to tolerance for organic brands because if we push too hard too soon. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. You don't need to do it. Exactly. That's the beauty of it. It's like when you're saying like, "Oh, it takes 150." It's like, "Cool. What if it took 300? It wouldn't matter as long as you have like the this economic diet. Yeah. The economics the the allowance for trough which you do because you don't have a high expense. You know the trough is literally time. It's not even cash trough really. And you just build that brand. You just build that brand and you're accepting money the whole way because it's an MR play. So you actually are increasing as you go across as long as they don't fall. The more they invest the more they are. Exactly. So you know it's Yeah. You get you everyone again it's like to each like everyone has to just customize it to it's different for industry it's different for niche different for model exactly and monetization model because if you're doing it that way just on the info coaching other people are doing it off of software like the guys who do the you know get my free Shopify course and it's littered with affiliate stuff it's like they make it off the rip right so like their situation is someone is like you said setting up new stuff getting accounts and whatever y and then ideally where they bolt on then info on the back where they get their high get. So, they just made and it's organic. It's like you guys are hilarious. That's why everyone's got their cars and their pen houses, by the way. It's like renting cash. I mean, it's it's amazing. It's crazy world. So, all right. Anything else in here? I don't think so on these. Well, that was great. That was like extremely valuable to me. I think I mean, it's been it's been it's great talking. I've I've learned a lot even just speaking. Yeah. No, I think talking through and I watched some of your videos. For me, a big thing that I've learned is like me 30 days or 90 or whatever ago, my clarity maybe around especially like the systems or thinking or how you process it or your um just your ability to like understand things has mine has strengthened so much from talking about it and modeling it out and doing I saw you do your boards and going through them. Yeah, I enjoy you think. Yeah, exactly. Absolutely. Yeah. So, I think I don't know I get value from that but I'm not consuming anything which is the issue. So I think these are going to be good for consuming those are going to be good for processing your thoughts but like puts you in the teacher seat which is how you you know have mastered which I don't necessarily know master is the right word but like how you know if you can teach it you understand it fully type of mentality. Yeah, but then you're a teacher and you're no longer a student and like like I need to I need to dance that line of like a couple teacher moments and mostly student moments and back and forth. But I feel the same way the same way. Yeah, it's it's cra because and like I said, you probably take calls for free, maybe just like coffee calls and and like I'm usually like legit anyone that's that been on a call with me can vouch like we just whiteboard. I just scribble. Like I just like I saw you write. How do you write? Use your mouth or your mouse? Yeah. You can't do it on a trackpad. You need a like the the Yeah. Well, that's what I use, but I don't know. I saw you like drawing stuff and like writing and I've never tried that. I type in the boxes or I draw boxes and Yeah. The hack is you got to like increase the sensitivity to this is like the highest degree. Yeah. And then like you just got to get like I'm used to like anyone someone every time someone touches my mouse it's like Yeah. Oh yeah. I have everything on max. I just literally I can't write it with a pencil. I haven't picked up I just I'm got used to it. You got that Becker vibe going. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. This used to be so good. Well cool man. All right. So people know where to find you and all that. I mean X is where I found you. Saw you on you know just your name. Yeah. Yeah pretty much. Yeah. my name. Awesome. All right. Well, we will stay connected and we'll have to loop back on this when you're doing, you know,und and something a year. 100%. I'm always down, man. It's been a pleasure. But yeah, we'll catch you. All right. Take it easy, man. Bye.
