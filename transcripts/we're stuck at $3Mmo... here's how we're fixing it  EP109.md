What's up, guys? In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the bottlenecks we are currently facing at $3 million a month in cash collected in our info coaching business. We're going to go through marketing, some of the funnels, and what we're stuck at in each one of these, the sales bottlenecks, fulfillment, and admin, tech, and overhead. And then we're going to identify which one is the biggest lever to pull right now of our current bottlenecks. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 78 million actually, I think, now in uh total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is just to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so right now we're at about 3 million a month. Uh we're trending actually a little bit less than that. We're trending like 2.95 right now for this month, but last month we did over 3 million in cash. And these are our funnel stacks. So I have a lot of videos talking about these, so I'm not going to beat this to death, but essentially you have a VSSL opt-in funnel that comes through here. It's a call booking funnel. So, they apply, book a call, talk to a setter sometimes, and then talk to a closer. Uh, you also have a direct to application. So, you have someone who just applies uh direct on page. They don't have to opt in or anything to do so. And then you have a low ticket ascension that does not optimize for AOV and upsells and stuff. Optimizes to get them on the phone with a setter to then push them to a closer. All right. And do qualifications. So, with marketing right now and oops, and on each one of these funnels, there we go. So for marketing, we just uh if if we were to identify just the bottlenecks that are in marketing right now, if I started with the VSSL brand face one. So with the VSSL, this thing has always worked for us as like the core, but we just kind of hammered it too hard. So we did 71 million through uh this one funnel right here. Um and now we're layering in different ones that have different brand faces, different messaging, and all that. Um and the biggest thing with these just getting the cost and alignment. So we're just testing these right now and and these have always been kind of the tried and true for us. Um, so I wouldn't really identify as like a full-on bottleneck, but it is definitely like the issue more so, and I'll get to it a little bit later, is kind of what's happening post, but it's all around the messaging. So, we're getting the right cost per application, right cost per call that they're not backing out. So, you could push that into sales and be like, "Oh, sales isn't closing." Um, but I can get to that. I'm going to get to that in the next one. Um, but really what it is is the overall framing in the VSSL is the beginning, the framing that's in the VSSL and in the messaging prior to the booking in alignment with what's after. Um, I just did a video with Jeremy Haynes and he talked a lot about this is how marketing like do your absolute best on the marketing standpoint so that really your closers are essentially just cashiers and like we're really really thinking about that because I think a lot of what is happening especially these new funnels that we're launching um it is really compelling but like when they go to apply they're not really uh as aligned with knowing that it's you know thousands of dollars for a program or XYZ so that then when they book and then postbooking we hit them with all this stuff that's talking about like cost objections and all the value exchange all that kind of stuff it like puts them off and then the cancel no shows are increasing um so the bigger issue there is what we're getting through VSSL brand face um as well as DTA on the show and close um is the actual live call the cost per live call not necessarily just cost per call because the show rate is getting all wonky with this even though we have like all the best practices in place which kind of just goes back to the whole like golden thread of the continuity and the congruency across it so for the DTA same thing um for GTA it's just kind of all it's more so about how the application framing is especially if it's just right there available to click or you have to go in the direction which a lot of people do but usually it's for direct to cart where they will have just no button pop until like the actual CTA. So they'll land on a page that's just headline VSSL and it'll sit there uh with no button until it hits the CTA like 20 minutes later. So think like uh like ClickBank offers or stuff like that. Um there's a ton of people who run these, but usually it's when they're buying something direct um instead of like booking or applying and then booking a call. So, I don't know. Uh, on this one, we're kind of like stuck on this one a little bit. It's working, but like really only for retargeting piece. So, it's like can't stand alone. And then this one is the biggest lever for me right now in the marketing bucket of like bottlenecks is this uh low ticket. So, for us right now, we're selling this, but it's like an original. It's an OG uh one that I made and it really just kind of again also acts more as a retargeting. This is truly like the only piece that's acting really really good for cold and we're spending, you know, tens and tens of thousands of dollars a day. Um, so a majority of it will go up here and this will pick up pieces of it. Um, but what we need is somewhere where this works for us better. So right now it's just not a cold friendly enough like positioning or offer. Um, so we can't scale it beyond, you know, XYZ 50, 100, 150, whatever number um, a day and we need to go to hundreds a day in order to make it so the math that checks out across these gets this to where you can close 20, 30 units a day. Uh, which would mean hundreds a day on this. um obviously then in conjunction with these but so we just need to crack that. So we have a senior copywriter that's like completely on this right now. It's like the only thing he's doing and then we're going to start testing positioning. But this in marketing land is for sure in my opinion because these have the highest show rate and the highest close rate these through here. Um I I just think that the and the economics are the best uh as long as the cost per acquisition stays in pocket which it doesn't do at scale with this one. Um so we need to crack something that right here we can keep the cost per acquisition low enough that it works. or the net cost or the yeah net cost per acquisition. So yeah, that's for that one. For sales, what we're seeing right now is back I just want to put this one on top because show rates is kind of like marketing and sales. Um but show rates is huge right now. I don't know what is going on. Um like clearly something changed. We have all these different launches that are happening. We have some changes that are happening in sales. All the automation should have stayed the same. We also have seasonality with it being June and fitness and 46 year old women and that kind of stuff with like kids stuff and summer and whatever where that does happen. But like I don't want to blame seasonality. So really leaning in on the marketing front on how we can fix these and on the tech front of what we can do with automations and shows. I think it's really going to come down to the framing. So we solve for this and get another 20 30 whatever percent back. Um because for whatever reason we're like literally 50% blended. All the ones that talk to a setter or come through these funnels or come through whatever are like 75 80%. But the issue is they're like not even claimed or they're not I'm sorry confirmed with a setter. So the setters are reaching out and trying to confirm them or trying to do it through here and they just won't even answer. So it's like they booked but then they didn't. So it's like you might as well cut your or double your cost per call because your cost per live call is literally double. So if you're getting, you know, $100 bookings is actually 200 for a live call and then your costs get all wonky and you already see that in CPA. But this is the biggest one right here. I think um management I we had some changes in management in the sales realm and that just always creates hiccups. Um, so we are working on this kind of like actively right now. More of a cultural like people side of things, less of a skill-based thing. Um, so we're solving for this right now, which then also leads to consistency. So we'll have, you know, 150k day and like a 50k day and then like 140k day and then like, you know, we're kind of back into that land a little bit. Um, it is a little bit better than it was. I don't know how how long you guys have been watching, but I'm on day likeund8 or nine in a row of doing these. And on first 20 30 days I was talking about how we would have like 30k days and like 80k days and now it's like 50 60k day and then like 150k days. So like we're in the right direction or back to the right direction but still this needs to be like hammered out so that we have consistency across a seven-day and that also is the same thing for availability. So we'll have a third to like a oneird to one half of the amount of availability on the weekends which is just not cool because then they get over booked then you're like burning cash because you're spending into it. um show rate stuff if you don't have setters on to confirm like we just have an issue with coverage so that also hurts the consistency so working on that and then once these are solved um oops and I forgot on here I can't actually type now but consistency and consistency in per in performance so making sure the offer rate and the close rate across team are in alignment that we're getting rid of people on team um you know obviously only ones that like are not performing um and can optimize for that but that comes through management and then volume once these are dialed in then it's like okay Cool. Now we can add two, five reps a month and scale into that, but can't do that. You don't want to I mean, there's just no reason to scale on like a shaky foundation. So, we are rushing um to get this fixed or to get this set up because this makes their job easier and then when their job is easier, these things come more natural and then you can push volume. So, it's kind of like still right here. I would say this is the number one lever. Um because what this solves for is the economics of this is this is a live call. So like the cost per live call. As long as we can keep that down and in pocket um with the actual obviously quality and whatever. So like get them to show high high quality, make sure all the framing and stuff is in there and then make sure the calls are in alignment. Like that's the true north right now with this. Um and then these are just like necessary things. And then we can increase the volume. If we can increase the volume, we can press 5 8 million a month I believe. Um just with the current setup and stack just more volume through it. Um on the fulfillment side, there's actually a pretty big one, but I don't have any charts for this. uh uh written out. Sorry guys, I just got back from a trip and I've been go go go go. So um tech and data on this, we never really focus on this. I never really focus on this and that is on me. Um but we do not have enough tech uh we did not have a proper tech setup for fulfillment of the product on the customerf facing side or on the internal data side of what we were storing. So we kind of had like multiple sources of truth. We had communication over here. We had um the platform they're all logging into over here. We have the billing over here. And like it worked again like you know thousands and thousands of active customers but it was time to centralize all the data and then make it so the stack is clean. So we are going through migrations of this right now. But this will allow for efficiencies in how we are able to like the the for example the client count per coach let's say it's like 50 right now. Um we are going to be able to essentially like double that or call 30 to yeah 30 to we'll just say double it. So it would be really cool. um the real targets like 30 to 50% is what I was going to say there um to increase and then keep cost the same because their job will be easier when it's all in one tool and there is software the software enables efficiency so we're focusing on that retention another big one that was an issue of stuff that happened from sales selling on you know selling in a way and using financing stuff that you know had them doing XYZ to get 24-month financing or all this for like an annual program um as well as how we were servicing the actual contracts we'll service them super super well for that first year but not focus focused on like talking about their year 2, three, five for life with us. Um, and that was a big thing. So, we shifted that up about four to six months ago and so now we have another six to eight months until that fully fleshes out for all the new people coming in who got that XYZ service who were framed in XYZ way. Um, retention is actually working pretty well right now, but um, we have a big thing in July where we do a big retention push that's like a special. So this one, but I just want more of an evergreen approach on here, more touch points, which does come from the Tekken data because we need to know the activation points. And then LTV boost, this is either through partnerships or self um of everything. I made a video on this yesterday I believe uh or two days ago that all around how can we boost more because the more you can fix this this piece right here the I don't want to say the less matters but like it isn't as integral that you're perfectly like hitting KPI um like perfect perfect KPIs on the hamster wheel of acquisition when you have continuous LTV boost and like forever customers um because you obviously make more money off the current customer that you already paid once to acquire so if we can focus on this and that is for us we rolled out a back-end product but we also So, we're going to launch two new things I don't really want to talk about yet. Um, but we are focused on doing those and I think we're going to do them in-house. So, we're just shopping around figuring out how we're going to do it. Uh, and when the timing of it makes sense cash flow-wise slash like size of volume, more so like volume. So, like once we hit XYZ volume, we feel like it'll make sense to do. Um, so we have like three different tanches of how we're trying to layer this in. basically as a front-end product increase uh post-purchase for anybody that purchase any of those backend after retention and then basically a continuity thing for the entire um customer base. So this is I this is like a leaky bucket situation where it's like every even if you're crushing this the more you sell like you're still not if you don't have this solve for you're just like there's just money left on the table. So right now this on the marketing side, this on the sales side actually that one's kind of hard because it might be this but uh we're gonna say this because it is just directly out of the box the biggest lever uh which actually comes from marketing. Uh fulfillment is this on what we can do with either partnerships or in-house and then the admin tech overhead piece is project management which leads to team efficiency. So this is massive for us right now. like we have so many talented people. Um, but I'm like in there trying to organize it or structure it and then trying to have them lead them and it's like they need like a PM inside the meetings that are like keeping up the ClickUp boards and doing all that. Like we have a lot of again really talented people at like their role. Um, but things can slip through the cracks. Things can get timelines pushed out. It can take five people to make one decision on like a simple thing. And we're starting to get kind of there. So like I need to solve for this now. So, I literally have uh interviews tomorrow to talk to people about just like how they do this and maybe hire one, but probably just like understand the structure of how people are doing this. Um because this is this is huge. Like we have a large team now and we want to focus on the team efficiencies and make sure that you know the person who comes in for $5,000 a month um assuming they're you know ROI justified role can make back you know a hundred a month or whatever math right so yeah those are the big like focuses focuses for us right now. So to recap in marketing, if we crack low ticket cold uh in the correct way, that'll solve the economics of the entire business because of the acquisition because it's kind of like the biggest percentage of new unit. Um so if we can solve for that with that piece, the show rates, so both from all of these as well. So these are basically lead funnels. This is a purchasing funnel. So you're you're talking to buyers versus leads. If you can solve for show rates, this would be a massive lever and like you know overnight 30% more in cash collected on the same volume if solved for. So that one is huge. Um consistency performances as well but I believe if we solve for this because the quality will go up because the intention will go up as well. Um that this will just kind of follow and then we can press volume but like in domino effect on the fulfillment side LTV boost we're already working on the tech and data and we're already working on this too but it's just like this is a much bigger game. This is like entrepreneur mode almost where you're starting things up and we don't want to necessarily be the ones to do it. We want um people in the team to feel empowered and have led it themselves. Um but also have like our eyes on it and kind of the the double check on making sure that these launch correctly and that they make sense. Um and then also just like deciding how aggressive we want to go on this versus like because you for a lot of these LTV boosts like you could just do partnerships where you're like oh someone with supplements will give me 40% or 60%. It's like, can we just take that and then, you know, press them over there and then make 10 grand, 50 grand, 100 grand from that versus, do you do it in house? If you do it in house, do you have 19 SKs? Do you have half a million bucks in inventory? Do you play that game? Do you play one skew game? Do you play? Right. So, we're just kind of like thinking through pieces of that. That's just one like sub examples where I said supplements, but like we have two or three of those that are like based on feedback we got from the customers um of our customer base are like massive. Uh we just need to figure out how we're going to attack them. So this is a big one because it's like leaky bucket again. If you acquire a ton of customers but you never have these in place, you're just losing the opport the just opportunity cost for money is just massive. Like if you look at our retention numbers on this last batch, like we probably I mean the quick math is 20 30 million on the table. Um of the last 78 million, we probably literally missed out on 20 or 30 because of how we didn't have things built in for LTV retention, all of that. And retention falls into the LTV boost bucket. So that's a big one. And then yeah, now where we're at, we've tried to have project managers in the past and just kind of hasn't worked for us because we weren't at the size we needed them and now it's funny because now we got up to the size and we don't have one. Um, so I don't really know that I want to throw another person into the team stack right now. But if it's somebody who can manage the people in terms of like all the projects and cross functional and at some level like I already do that. It's just I don't want to do that. Uh, and I don't want to focus on that in the future and be in all the meetings and like following up on due dates and doing all that kind of stuff. It's like, you know, I want people to be accountable to do that, but I also want someone to be there right next to them helping them structure these things out and build them into ClickUp or Asauna or whatever um you guys use, but we use ClickUp and then yeah, get the team efficiencies out and or just lean out the team if we don't find them. If we have someone come in and you realize, you know, one person is doing one thing a week, it's like no. So, yeah, those are our current ones. I like to talk about the wins and the losses. And right now we are a little bit on the struggle bus sitting stuck at this. Um not stuck at this. We did 1.5ish 1.6 then three and then this month we're pacing around three again. But if we crack any of these literally any of these we should be able to just press to five with current volume with current volume. So show rate being better will get us closer to four and some change and we would be able to push volume if that happened. Low take coal would change the economics completely. So the margin would just be insane difference um which would be huge. And then project management would be you know a slight cause on the overhead stack but if done efficiency if done efficiently this one kind of overflows into being able to manage this being able to manage this and being able to manage this. So I'm kind of looking at personally like this is my big lever number one because if I can do this then I can help marketing team be structured enough to roll this thing out and call it two weeks. I can have marketing team roll this out in the same two weeks because there's big enough team over there. And I can have fulfillment and um like ops team, product team working on this at the same time. So that's kind of where I'm at mentally with it. But hopefully this was helpful. I'm back in the office for a bit. Um and yeah, daily update. All the videos are here. www.rclog.comdoc. I think today is day 108. I don't know. 109 something uh in a row. I'm going to stop doing these daily soon. I don't know when, but one day I will and then I'll go to like two or three a week. And yeah, that's what I got. I got some other fun ones on here. Um, I do a weekly Q&A every week. If you have any questions, drop it on the request. I am doing a survey for info coaching people on what offers you have, where your cash collected is at, all that. Just because I'm trying to get survey data and see kind of like people who follow me in the audience, where they're at. I'm not selling anything. So, you can just check it out and uh you can put your contact info on the end if you want me to reach out. And then Rolodex is going to be anybody that I work with or refer out or whatever when people ask me for stuff. I just want to be able to send them a link. So sales agencies, softwares, whatever, all that kind of stuff. Don't go to it. I don't care. Um I'll make any referral for free. I don't I don't care. So that's that. And uh hit me on X or Instagram with any comments, questions, whatever. And leave some comments below this. I appreciate you guys and talk
