Well, Jent, um, I'll introduce Ryan from from what I know. Actually, it's quite a funny connection because Ryan is a the co-founder owner of the company that my mother started closing for two years ago, which is interesting. Um, previously a guy that I'd worked with on Iman's team, his girlfriend was also closing and she was like asking Jack, did he know of any of the guys on Iman's team have any sisters or, you know, girlfriends? And I was like, my mother actually is a good closer. And then my mother started working with them. And then I actually seen Ryan's stuff before I knew Ryan was involved with Warrior Babe. And then I was like, he's really good. Went to his Twitter and I seen Warrior Babe and I was like, oh that's sick. Um, so yeah, obviously them boys have done phenomenal numbers over the last multiple years. Anything in the info space in regarding to marketing, front end, back end. He's here to answer it all to be as transparent as possible, he said to me as well. Um, but yeah, overall great guy and he's doing some great work on the YouTube game right now as well. So go check him out on YouTube if you haven't already. Um, but yeah, Ryan, if there's anything I missed, maybe even a brief introduction, then we can hop straight into the the details that you've you've set up for us. Yeah, 100%. So, you guys have never done this before. So, transparent messages, Q&A, all the things probably going to how we're going to navigate this. Um, but yeah, started on X and YouTube about 85 90 days ago. Recorded every single day since. And the whole big push there was for us to find talent opportunities and network with people, right? We just kind of like lived in the cave and weren't very vocal about what we did. didn't have any friends in the space, didn't have any of that. Um, just through vendors. So, the quick of us is roughly six years ago. Uh, we started and essentially where Luke and Nikki met. So, they're the co-founders and I'm a co-owner. So, big difference there. They started this and then I came on as number four or five essentially uh and was building sales pages for them and doing like random ClickFunnels builds for a thousand bucks every like six to eight weeks. like it was a very light uh start and they were trying to sell a low ticket info product at the time that was a recurring uh a recurring product and then we kind of quickly six months a year in launched over into a call funnel and that's still the call funnel we run to today. So we've been running this funnel now for 5 years we've done 75 and 76 in total cash collected 76 million um and this funnel one specific did 71 million of that. So I'm going to walk you guys through some of the funnels. We're going to go through some math and then I literally just want to open this to Q&A. Understand? I heard sales, sales management, agency, like different kind of mix in the room. So, I just want to make this as customized as possible uh for you guys, but I'll walk through some of the uh the funnels to start and some of the math. So, let me know if you guys can see this. Yeah, good. All right. So, if you guys have seen in the YouTube, I apologize for the five minutes of what you've probably already heard. Um, but this was initially the YouTube is daily what is happening now. So it's if we're thinking and we're all in marketing, it's all me all talking about marketing. If we're in sales and trying to fix sales, we're talking about sales. So I talked a lot about this marketing piece in the beginning, but essentially this is what we call our VVS is what our CMO titled this, but it's our value vortex system. So we have three different funnels now actively running. This initial funnel right here is your classic VSSL opt-in funnel. And this is the one that we did 72 71 72 million in before we even launched these. So, these are going to be very, very classic. You're going to send someone to an opt-in page. It's going to be for a free training. They're going to watch. They're going to put in their name and email to access the VSSL. We have two different ones and splits going on now, but just to keep this simple, an opt-in page, a VSSL page that's going to wait until the call to action in the VSSL. That's call it 80% of the way through the video. And it's going to have an apply button pop. They're going to apply. They're going to book a call. They're going to have a thank you page. They're going to talk to a closer. And they're going to close. Okay? that is like the simplest throughput like humanly possible. And this one right here, we've done hundreds of thousands of calls through. So, this is like uh we're very very heavy in paid advertising. About 99% of our first click, 98% of our uh first click is through paid, not through organic, which is a lot different than I'm sure probably a lot of you guys, as well as like the Eman crowd and stuff like that. Super respect for what you guys do with organic. Uh it's just not a a channel that we ever leaned heavily into in terms of optimizing for you know virality or first click. It's always been for us content has been around middle of funnel and bottom of funnel. The next funnel we launched was actually this low ticket ascension. So look at it just as these. So you're going to have a sales page. I don't know if you guys are familiar with Alen Sultanic and what he does in the Nothing Held Back group on Facebook and he's got a bunch of good content. Um but this is essentially the the method he was teaching. Um so you're going to have a front-end sales page that's going to be long form. They're going to start the checkout process with their name and email and then move to an order form. So on this you're going to target call it 15% of the people that land on this page from cold, warm, whatever traffic are going to uh opt in on here. Go to a checkout page around 50% of the people are going to then purchase. And then the big difference here and what we're doing on low ticket versus what you'll see a lot on the internet is ours is focused on ascension. It is not focused on AOV. So, we are not trying to do upsell one, two, three, four, downell left, right, like any of that stuff. We are doing a post-purchase that just says, "Hey, you just purchased your product. Now, book your onboarding call, book your quick start call, your implement, whatever you want to call it." And we get them on the phone with a setter. The setter then gets them on the phone with a closer and then they close. Okay? So, this throughput right here has the highest show rate and close rate of anything in our entire company. So, all you're doing on this game is you're playing economics. So, if it costs you $150 to acquire a customer, that is $50 purchase. Your net CPA is 100 bucks. And I can go through some of this math over here for you guys if you want or we can just open straight to Q&A. Um, but essentially the net number that it costs to get somebody on here to here and to here backs out to less than if they're going through here because you are accepting cash, right? Because there's the offset of selling something low ticket. You also have the framing complete difference because you're talking to a buyer, not a lead. And then you also have the setter two call close instead of the one call close that occurs up here. All right, so that's the general gist and then I'll touch on this one briefly and then we can go into math or questions or whatever. Um, but DTA, this is super common in the space. You'll see this all over. We call it DTA. Some people call it uh direct to VSSL, direct to app, whatever you want to call it. And this is essentially your headline, your VSSL, and your apply button. Okay, so way less friction. They don't have to go through this step, wait until the thing pops, get to here, do this. they essentially are jumping directly to the application right here. So, you're going to have way more throughput, way lower cost per call. Um, but you are generally speaking not going to have the same quality consumption show rates. So, your show rates are going to drop, your close rates are going to drop depending on how you frame these pages. So, we almost use this as a retargeting asset, but a lot of guys, like if you listen to uh Jeremy Haynes, they talk a lot about this funnel. This is like the main one that they run for all their products that get to a million a month. um they'll run this to uh an app and booking kind of in one actually and then book it and then they do all the stuff that's in between these and I could talk for literally five hours about different automations and flows and tracking and metrics and math and all that but like I don't really want to bore you guys or go in a direction that's not where you live um and what is relevant for you. So up here is just the connection of how all three of these funnels play into one. Okay, so this is essentially how they work. They all flow in one. A lot of the core traffic is going to come through the opt-in funnel. It's going to hit a router. We technically have a routing that occurs inside of our application that'll make them qualified or disqualified. We still take the bookings even if they're disqualified, but we route them to a lower quality pod of sales reps or training sales reps. So top leads go to top bookings or top uh agents. And if calendars are full, it'll push them over here into this low ticket. And then the DTA and the low ticket are both getting their own direct traffic. But the master that gets a majority will then route into these other funnels. Okay. So I can go through metrics, I can go through stats, I can go through math, I can go through organization chart, I can do whatever you guys want. Um, so yeah, maybe we open it up a little bit to question on what. Um, so I see one already in the chat. James, you tell me how you want me to navigate and we can go from there. Yeah, we can do chat until there's none in chat. Boys, I say you can go by chat or you can raise hand, whatever you prefer. Okay. Yeah. I mean, let's start with this one in chat and then if you guys want to do audio, I'm open to either. So, first one we have in here is Tom saying, "What internal upsells do you have? And if so, how do you structure upselling current clients into the program and what's the tech behind the router?" Okay, so first one for the internal upsells. So, for us, the main offering, let me see if I can do this. I've never built one of these live. Um, but so for us, the main offering is going to be VIP. This is an annual program. This is our onetoone coaching. Okay? So, no matter where you come in on this funnel, you can technically buy this low ticket product. That's the only thing you can direct to cart purchase and that's going to be a um $37 product. There's one order bump on there because order bumps don't hurt conversion rates or um affect the flow because our whole thing on this is throughput. But so for internal upsells, the only thing that's going to happen is after their first year of VIP, they're going to be offered VIP again. So it's a continuation program. So it's onetoone personalization for the entire year. So, we have people that are two, three, four years into being a VIP member and they'll pay we do two internal uh upsell cycles or internal promotion upsell cycles uh that happen in July and Black Friday, Cyber Monday, so six months apart where we'll do a discounted rate of VIP. So, we'll drop it a,000 bucks, call it 5K, 6K, and it's only for internal renewals and we'll do 2 million bucks in a week and just hammer it to the current list. You just need to make sure you know your costs on fulfillment so it makes sense. Um, but we only do that twice. And then what we just now launched, we probably left 20 million bucks on the table. Um, so far on how because we've had a leaky bucket and because we haven't retained these in the correct way. We've been stuck on this hamster wheel of getting new clients. You hear hormone, you hear a lot of these people talk about this, your LTV to CAC and all of that. It's because we've had a leaky bucket where people will churn out of this and that's for a million reasons. Because of how the fulfillment structured, because of the payment plan types we put them on. We tried to use a firm external financing and we didn't realize it was set up wrong and people could do 24 months of payments for a 12-month term. So someone's still paying into the second year which is like legal and okay but just like not good for retention and long term. So what we just rolled out is actually a thing called 360 and this is going to be group coaching. So our fulfillment model changes from onetoone to group. So you have a coach that has multiple right and doesn't do any of the onetoone communication all this stuff. your so your fulfillment cost goes down from call it 15 or 20% to 5% or less 2%. This is more of the Eman or like what a lot of these guys will do the classic group coaching model. Um so their fulfillment stack it's way less and then this is like half price. So this will be 7200 this is 3600 and this is for the year. So they basically just join they stay for community they stay for access to the app they stay for all the things they want to stay for but don't have to pay the full price for the second year just they basically pull back on that. So internal upsells, these are the only ones that would exist is year two because everything in year one is sold as uh one year. Um we do have different payment plans, but everyone is locked into a year-long contract. And then the tech behind the routing is in current state uh is Jot Form. So we just got on it early. I'm not a super fan of Jot Form. I like custom. I like you see a ton of people use type form. Like both work. Um, but essentially the router inside here is going we have one financial qualifier question that for us because we're not doing MMO or like ROI justification stuff. It's how much have you invested in yourself in the past. So it's basically saying have you invested uh less than 1K, 1 to 5K, 5 to 10, 10 to 20 or 20 plus. The less than 1Ks are what route to the DQ and they have a half the they have half the conversion rate that the that the next ones do. So all the other ones are 10, 11, 12% roughly and the less than 1K are 5%. And that's also causation and correlation because they're going to uh lower quality reps. So it's like you kind of play that game, but you have to think of it as the most positive side. And the most positive side is if you have the top possible lead coming through, do you want that lead landing with your newest rep? And the answer is no. You never want that. You never want someone who is the most qualified person in the world landing with one of these people. So you have to segment those out. But how we talk about it is essentially like imagine you have 10 bookings that come through and only two are premier and like top clients. You want those two to go there first. The other eight then get spread across top closers and bottom closers, right? But you just always want to make sure that those top top top people land with the top top top reps because if not, you're bleeding out on places that are like yeah in in the good fashion. So let's jump over to the raised hands and then we'll go or Tom has another one in here. Tom has another one. Uh then I'll go back to those. Uh I spoke to Nate management community and I mean he said you guys increase cash a ton from financing. Yeah. So we did when Nate was there and then on the tail end of when Nate was there. So Nate's great. Nate took us So some context on our our sales team structure. So we ran it ourselves like me and Luke were running the sales team. We onboarded the first hundred and something. We managed them. We took sales calls. Like we did all that to start and then as the team grew we tried to do sales. We actually we did the classic take your top rep and make them the manager which is the dumbest thing in the world and we didn't know that and uh we did that and everything exploded. So sales management exploded, culture exploded. We had to fire half the team. It was like a complete mess. Um and then the next layer was us trying to manage it ourselves then trying to do sales agencies through closers IO and stuff. Love those guys but like just wasn't a good fit for the external side. And then we tried to do uh 1099 external agency management, but it wasn't structured how it is today where it's like 20% flat fee. If it was that, I would do that all day back in the day, but now not now where we're at. And then we got Nate, we poached Nate kind of uh from Pompa and he had the high he was the largest pod leader of PMPA. So he had gotten up to three million a month in cash collected. We had only ever done a million a month in cash collected. And so we brought him over and we got up to 3 million a month of cash collected and then we stalled out. And uh Nate was great. Um but also a big portion of that is we added a firm as our financing partner and we're allowing 24 months financing and like 50 plus% of our closes were going through external financing which is not the model. I am not a fan of that and I don't think that we should have done that and can't go back in time but it really hurt retention a lot. So it's like we ramped a ton of new people but they any any external financing person for us was the highest refund rate, the highest chargeback, the most complaining, the most whatever and also the most unlikely to retain and like you know go into the next year. So now it's 15% maybe uh of our current and we are looking at some other options. We just got approved for split it. Um some people use some other external things. They'll occasionally link them to credit cards but yeah that's the that's what we ended up using. Um so let's go. I don't know which one in order of hand raises, but go for it. Tamir, who we got? Who we got? I see three. Tamir, you're up. Yeah. So, I had one question specifically about um your sales team when it comes. So, you guys are majority uh female reps. Yeah. Yeah. I think we have one or two males right now of 22 reps. Yeah. That's sick. How are you guys sourcing good quality female reps? It's been a big uh challenge. Yeah. So like to give you a point of reference, the most recent sales rep is sales rep ID number 376. So we are on our 376th hire for this. Um so our entire team is W2 now. On here I see one, two, there's two males of the current active roster that's now 23. Um and then main sourcing. So we've had some really good referrals. uh we kind of like have become we've become more known now in the space so where like the lead flow almost exists as like organic and referral. Um but for the longest time the very first batch came from community. So we hired from our clients and those ones crushed for us. So when we were selling the info product, it was a,000 bucks or 1,500 at one point over the phone and uh everybody who was on the sales team was a client of the product and then we taught them the scale the sales skills and the CRM skills and that was really good. But then when we changed the offer to instead of the info product to the coaching which was six times the price it was not good because one their belief and they hadn't bought that product right so like they weren't somebody who had spent 7K so to try and sell something 7K I think there was like a belief dissonant like you know mis congruent or whatever um so that was one thing then we tried to do the remote closer sicko classic style which I'm sure you guys are all familiar with the internet marketing high ticket sales cruise and like they crush. But like for us, we're selling to 46 year old women, 40 to 60 year old women and it's just not the vibe. Like we will have people who specifically say to the men, "Oh, I want to talk to a female only." Like they'll get booked with a male and they will message in and say, "I'm not taking this call unless I'm with a female." So like it's been a thing for us. Um but there's they're W2 now, not 1099. So we do have some, you know, there's like legality around only hiring this or that. Uh so we navigate that clear clean. Um, but we've now I mean to direct answer the question everywhere like we we'll get a new closer and they'll be like, "Oh, my two friends are closers and we need them." We've tried out of Shelby Sap's community. We've tried out of Closers. io. We've tried out of nothing held back group. We've tried Nate's recommendations. We've tried like we have such an inflow now. We have like 90 in the pipeline sitting right now that just sit there and like the most recent three that You mind sending me a few? Huh? You mind sending me a few? Yeah. Well, I heard of uh I made a post about this when I was trying to hire a sales manager and like six people linked to software or not software like a marketplace that all these guys pay that's I'm pretty sure there's like two or three of them but they basically upload all their stats in there. You pay 250 bucks a month or 250 something and like there Yeah. Like I think it's that one actually. It's mainly men though. Yes. Yeah. And then I I love the like Shelby's business model. Um, but I have I I don't have a ton of experience knowing like if that those are quality reps or if they you know because a lot of them are obviously beginners then getting into the space. I don't know how much training and stuff they need. They're pretty good. I hired two hired two from her and they they crushed it. Yeah. So like I think that is a good example of especially if you're trying to source female only. Um but yeah, depending on what the product is, getting them from the client base is huge if you can leverage that correctly. It's like you you basically have super oversimplified, but you have like the belief and the product and like the understanding here and then you have like the sales skill, the tech, the ability to do this like if you were to bucket it and if you can get someone who has this piece and then teach them what they need to know in the sales skills and the tech and like your systems versus all these high ticket people come in with this without any other product and it's like sometimes that can just be not good, right? Sometimes they can bully, they can push over the line, they can not understand, they can offer stuff in the program that's not included. you have that whole like fight of CS product and sales because it's like you promised them like nine extra one-on-one calls just to get them over the line and like we don't fulfill on that. Like you have to navigate that. Um but yeah, Shel's a good one and then there's a couple other ones. There's uh uh her last call I think is another one that's will um will change lives on Instagram. Yeah, his him and his girlfriend I believe uh have one. So, but again, those are going to be like your young gun shot out of a cannon, like high ticket for female. Uh, if you want the older kind of age demo, you got to you got to snipe them. Like, we just got one that came from Gym Launch. Uh, Publishing.com is apparently downsizing uh and they're doing a bunch of changes there. So, a ton of their closers are on the hunt, so we have a pipeline of those guys. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, what what would it take in order for me to maybe source like one or two reps from your bench? I mean, they're not going to be the good ones. Or or is that a complete No. No. I mean, I I don't even know. I don't like I could train I could train good. I could train good. I I I don't So, here's a better question is so for you guys, how do you currently hire or how do you currently source? Yeah. So mainly mainly just like referrals and people we know in the network in the info space that run kind of you know the make 10k a month is high ticket closer offer those kind of communities job post and stuff like that. Yeah. So for us so at one point in time we bought and owned high ticketfitnesscloers.com and we built an entire uh funnel for this. So we ran ads that then went to a VSSL funnel that was Luke and like going through an application funnel populated into a full like imagine you're running a salesunnel but you're running it for hiring and that's what any of like the big dogs say they do at scale is you need that. So you're going to have roles like an HR director that you're going to oneoff snipe and hire or whatever a senior tech lead or whatever. Um and then you're going to have evergreen roles. So for us our two core evergreen roles are going to be our coaches so to fulfill on the product and our sales reps. So we have those constantly. That's why that pipeline looks like that is because we've been in sales management transition. So we haven't been onboarding new people. So the pipeline has built up, right? So same thing with coaches. We haven't been hiring for coaches because we have x amount of open spots. And then we wait until we get to a point where it's like, yeah, we're ready for more volume. And then we go into there and hire from those pipelines. You constantly need to fill that bench. So whether it's a hiring funnel, it's classic. It's exactly what you'd imagine. It's traffic sources, whether that's Indeed, whether that's referrals, whether that's whatever. They sit in an application bench. They move from an application bench to a group coaching bench. They go from group coaching to singular approvals and then move into onboarding. It's like the classic flow. So, you just need to standardize and get consistency around the inflow. If you're trying to scale a little bit more aggressively, if you're trying to just snipe, then you just snipe them. Then you just find the best of the best. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. I appreciate it. Keep up with the content. It's uh good. I'm trying. I'm stopping at 100, so we'll see what happens after 100. I'm at 90. Okay, Chris, don't stop, man. Don't stop. I'll see if I'll see if I can get Iman on tomorrow when I'm there. But, um, all right. Who else was We had these two hand raises and then I'll go through the next question. Tristan, I'll go a quick one. Um, how highly do you value the uh low ticket ascension funnel? very except currently um if you look at here or let me do so currently what we looked at after a while on ours was ours is not cold friendly enough. So for us let's say call it 5% ascend. So you're going to have a 100 low ticket purchases that are going to come through here and you're going to have five that pop out as clients let's just say which is a great ascension rate. Um if we're trying to do 20 units a day I need to sell 400 of these a day. this funnel and how it's framed and what the product is and how all of that cannot do 400 a day. So the economics are on they work but as soon as we get over call it 50 75 whatever units of this a day it breaks and the economics breaks. So then the funnel no longer works and that is because of how it is framed right now is too low on the awareness or however you want to look at it to it is the it is framed as something that is not cold friendly. We can't we can't vsh this and sell 500 or a thousand units a day in this current model. So this mainly acts as almost like not retargeting necessarily but 50% of the people that purchase this are somewhere that have already been inside our VSSLs are already in our ecosystem are already in our CRM have consumed our content. So the economics work for that but it doesn't work at cold scale. So the new iteration of this is essentially this one down here and it's completely different framing. It's built for cold. It's mass market like uh Moves Method is a good example. They run tons of volume uh and they're in the fitness space. The I think it's women's fitness specific. Um they're out of Australia and they do millions a month right now and it's all from low ticket and then they have uh Ascension on the back end for high ticket. But their model and their their offer is framed in a way that's friendly to cold. So right now it's very low volume for us in terms of like we'll do 20 plus units a day and only a couple will pop through through this and a majority are going to come through here and then some through here. So it's basically like call it 70% 10% 20% maybe right now. Um but the goal is to get this much higher because the other thing is once you can spend 100 grand a day on ads your brand awareness is way up way way up right because they're seeing your eyeballs or like their eyeballs are on it which is good for us at scale. Um, but it doesn't make sense to spend into these ones because of the availability, right? You get fully booked at 200, 400, whatever calls a day that here you don't have that issue because you're liquidating and you're making you're making some of your spend back. So, yes, I think that answered that. But yeah, this is going to be a big direction of the future for us. It's just we haven't cracked it on cold to where we can sell 250 of them a day at a good cost. What are you guys selling as the actual low ticket product? The reason that I ask is like we have a huge organic audience that we're looking to basically leverage because a lot of guys are starters and they don't really have a lot of money. Um, so we want to leverage and kind of, you know, ascend them into, okay, I made $1,000 using your onetime purchase, $49 thing. And then now I feel like I have the social proof or the proof that I can invest into learning to make 10 grand. Um, and we're kind of leveraging trying to figure out like how we're going to do that. So ours is uh the ultimate guide to macronutrients which again is like only somebody who has the awareness of what macronutrients are or interested in that versus like a 7-day metabolism reset which is more mass market and cold friendly. So a big issue I see a lot of people do is like if in your case they'll sell something that either solves too much of the problem or is not congruent with what the upsell and backend is. So you'll sell a thousand units of something and no one will ascend because you either solve their problem too much here or because what you sold here doesn't directly like ladder them to the next thing. So our example of selling an ultimate guide to macronutrients gets their feet wet, gets them understanding the macros, understanding kind of like their customization a little bit based on some cookie cutter style stuff. It's not cookie cutter actually, but it's it's just the macronutrient part. And then the upsell and the ascension is what you really need is onetoone coaching. What you really need is, you know, transitions from body phase to body phase. What you really need is like all of these other customizations and onetoone help. And that's this next step. And like this is still very valuable on its own is a big core thing is like they have to feel like they get so much value. We're like done with the days of just launching a low ticket over a weekend that we just decided to spin up to make cash. Like ours take weeks to build because they're like full products. So you have to make sure that it's, you know, a bite, a small bite of the main apple that leads them to the next thing. So basically build your dream offer of what your backend thing is, then peel it away, peel it away, peel it away, and find the little chunk that you can sell up front to get them to the next piece or sell them the thing that is like the Alen Sultanic model is basically you're selling the same thing across the whole like golden thread, but you're just selling different layers of implementation is another way to look at it. So basically you'll sell the entire package, everything, but this person has to go through every video, every step and do it themselves and have no help doing it. The middle that's going to be the mid ticket or high ticket is going to be doing it with them either in a group setting and then the top tier is doing it onetoone with your help and that's like classic hormos on sultanic whatever the ascension pyramid comes with your time and their likelihood they think they're going to achieve that result which at the top tier is working direct one-on-one with you with all your stuff your personalization done for them whatever and then down here is like here's all the information just figure out how to do it on your own right so like you just have to make sure you tier the ladder in the right way and that there's flow because if there's not flow then you're just wasting time and resources. Yeah, appreciate you, man. Yeah. Next. Hi, Ryan. Nice to meet you. How we doing? Nice to meet you. We're doing good. So, uh, my question is, uh, I run an info agency and I'm looking to launch an offer in the Danish market where I'm from and I've been looking at some different niches and I've come to figure out that I think financial advisory based on also your videos would be a great niche to go into because you can have like a huge backend to monetize if done correctly, right? Um, and my question is that I haven't found any models in other countries where they sell something which is high ticket in the front end. Um, do you know of any models where it's possible to sell something which is very expensive in the front end? Because the only one I've been able to find find is like Dave Ramsey. Um, and he only like his whole model is basically helping the big population, right? And and sell something which is very cheap. Um, and it's really hard to get the wheels rolling when it's cheap. Yeah. Cash flow tactics. Yeah. So, I talk about this a couple times. So, I spun one of these up when I was So, okay. So, Warrior Babe at one point was just going to be a cash flow info coaching business. So, in doing so, I was all the tech and systems and structure, not really the ops. Like, it didn't it didn't require ops because it was only doing 10 10 million bucks a year. Everyone ran their bucket. uh as we've now chosen to go into like this big big game of like let's go to hundreds millions a year and like go direct response heavy backend multiple SKs full sea level whole thing um I so all to say on the side I was doing random gigs I was like building random things I was making money over here doing this and this and one of them at the time this had just launched and I was friends with an a whole life insurance rep okay so he was an agent that sold whole life insurance through infinite banking it's called which is like a really common thing in in the US uh as a known thing. So, this had just launched. These guys were in uh inner circle for ClickFunnels. So, Russell Brunson's like mastermind and he basically positioned I don't even know. Let's see what they're selling today. But when they initially sold this, they ran a webinar funnel that was direct to cart and I'm pretty sure it was a $2,000 offer and they basically taught people how to uh you know escape the rat race in 10 years or less, right, without Wall Street. And like this was their claim, but they were selling a 2K product that was a course. And in the entire time of the course, it was teaching them how to do real estate investing, how to escape their this, this, this, and this. But you have to use this vault to do it. Like there's this great way to do it using this vault. This vault, this vault, not like book a call. So they just nobody knows their numbers, but let's say they're breaking even. Let's say it was costing them $2,000 to acquire a customer for $2,000. They were breaking even on the info coaching side of the business, but then people were booking in a call to talk to them about the vault. And the vault was whole life insurance. And then they were selling 100k, 500k, million-doll policies. And we're making whatever the let's, you know, let's lowball and say 25% commissions. And then they're adding them to their insurance book. And then the idea being with whole life insurance is you can lend against it. So you can put 100k in, you have instant access to 80k, call it, and then you're going to take you're going to borrow that 80k out to use it in real estate. So you have your money working in more than one place in right. So it becomes this education around the financial instrument that you can use. People do this with taxation. There's another big guy that I'm forgetting his name, but he was at Onyx and theirs is all framed around taxation. So it's for business. It's like for if you're a business owner that does over 100k this and this. We we refuse to use financing because if you have to use financing to purchase our product, you don't have enough money to work with us. like that whole framing and gambit. They get inside there and then they use them for financial management. They have estate uh attorneys. They have insurance guys. They have like their whole rolodex of everything you need once you're somebody who's worth 10 million, 30 million, $100 million. You need an estate attorney, you needed this, you needed this, you need a this. And it's their referral partners out. So, this was more beginner friendly, like teaching somebody who already has a couple hundred grand, someone who's 40 to 60 years old, call it, that's basically just wants to like retire in 10 years or less. and it's teaching them how to get passive income to replace their active, doing it through real estate, but oh, you really need to do it through this financial instrument and real estate. And then they also owned the real estate company. So, they owned a brokerage that did the real estate portion where they already had done for you flips. They had uh ARMS where you could do um what do they call it? Hard money lending or that bridge finance stuff. So, they had it so you could do it for other members and they had a fund. They had like all these other monetization methods. So to my I I think if I'm like do not quote me on this but I think they did 10 million in 10 months I think with the info coaching and who knows how many tens and tens and tens on the back end and they have a thriving community. They've then cross sold them other things. They've had other products when the world went to [ __ ] and they were all like everyone was concerned about what's happening in financial markets. They had other products and things to sell them. So that's why I say that industry. Um, I ran a VSSL call funnel direct instead of doing this with info coaching because my brain wasn't on yet and I didn't understand how that worked. I could only see this far. So, I just ran the same VSSL callunnel we run in Warrior Babe for that and they were getting crazy qualified leads, but because the consumption wasn't there, they weren't actually purchasing. You're talking to a 55-year-old to move a million dollars out of their 401k and it just was very unlikely to happen because they didn't have the trust built the consumption, they hadn't purchased anything, they hadn't whatever. So that's why I say run info coaching with beautiful backends. Don't just go straight to the back end. That's why I say that because I did it and it didn't work. So you need the consumption. You need the people to come from buyers because if they're going to do this huge trust act thing with you, which is millions of dollars they're going to move or whatever large portions of their net worth, it's probably a better way to say it into whatever vehicle or asset management or whatever. You need to have the trust built. And that's why you have the Ramsies of the world that have so much content that it works. That's why you have these guys that have courses. That's why you have these guys that have books and courses around this as well. Um I'm forgetting the other one. It's like but like I have like four of these books. All these these are the guys that run BookFunnels, right? Because they want you to sit there with them for six hours and read them and think in their words because you need the consumption before you do anything with all of your money, right? So that's why I say this market. I don't specifically know for your country and for your market what does or doesn't work. what I'm talking like I can promise you if these financial instruments exist in your market then this will work. It just it creates it's a bigger moat and it's there's a reason a lot of people don't do it is because the consumption around this. There's another guy on uh Instagram that's uh let me see if I can find him because I just want to show you one more example. But the rule of thumb is like if I don't get it completely wrong, they sell to an audience which al already has money, right? Not the family father. Yeah, you have more room for uh error. So like this guy right here does the same thing except he does it through organic. So this guy partnered with a big uh agency. So, he's an agent himself and he does all these videos and directly calls out whole life insurance, whole life insurance, uh, infinite banking, has super long form YouTube videos and does all this and he makes ungodly amounts of money. And all he does is then point them over here. They go to the training, right? The infinite banking and it's a VSSL funnel that they opt in for on a GHL and that's it. And they will opt into a VSSL funnel, but they've consumed his content prior. They go through this and then he has people inside his agency that he's like partnered with and because he's licensed that's the other big play for you. I don't know how your monetization model is set but I got licensed so I could be on the cases because it's illegal to be on the cases and get a percentage of the revenue unless you're actually licensed as an agent. So you can only in our market I don't know again about your country. It's the same in Denmark. Yeah. So you have to get licensed in order to be on the cases which does offer risk by the way or does introduce risk into it. Uh or you have to get paid as a like a flat fee. So, you have to be like, I get paid five grand for every case you place because you know the average commission is 40k or whatever number. Um, you you either need to know your numbers or you need to get licensed and go through the process if you want to be attached. That's the big big game because if you have hundreds of these policies, you get like first year commission bumps, you hit like thresholds. Like these agencies are crazy. If you have x amount of units, you get invited to Rome to go to all the conferences. Like there's all these like fun things if you're like a because then you're a top insurance producer because you're on a million cases. But there is risk to that because if things do happen, you are on the case for negative and positive. So this is one way. I do know people who do the same thing uh in affiliate and lead genen mass scale where they just fire off the leads and get paid 20 bucks per call. But that's a different game. That's like live transfers and live calls. But if we're talking info coaching, this is how these guys work. That makes sense. And if you were to start again, that would be the same model you would go about. I would build this. I would build this. Yeah. I bet I could build this into like 250 million a year. Yeah. Yeah. It would take me take me years and years to do and I the biggest thing is the partners too. It's definitely the partners, but the these are [ __ ] huge. Huge. And these guys don't know info coaching like at the same level that like a lot of us do. I talk about this a lot, but like I think that I I got off a call earlier today that was somebody who's doing it in a sports niche. So I don't want to dox their stuff, but they do organic. They do a million a month with like a 5k offer cruising and they are uh uh for a specific like sport. So let's say like a soccer goalie or you guys say football, I don't know, you know what I mean? A goalie. Uh and they basically have such a pipeline. They have they're so good at it. It's remote and in person. So they have a facility that's like their office but also has like training center and whatever. And uh people will do remote and in person. And they have people who have been drafted. They have people who become all stars. They have like basically the whole tranches of like think about it like the most is going to be your like middle school, high school, college, pro, allstar, whatever. And they have like thousands, low thousands, hundreds, you know, tens. They have insane insane results. And their backend play is massive because they can I mean, you guys know, I'm sure, but the comp packages for sports and how you want to tie and play that out and theirs is the same thing. So this is a bigger backend because of how financial markets and all that kind of stuff work and like the the tools and instruments you can use. But this is just the biggest thing is the content engine and the partners of this. You can build an info coaching around anything. I know a guy who has it about how to build the largest pumpkin or how to grow the largest pumpkin. So like it's I am such a fan of using internet marketing and info coaching on an industry that is not internet marketing and not info coaching. Right. So, we do it in fitness. These guys do it in some sports niche thing over here. That guy does it in pumpkin growing. I use the example on from my first million of the guy who did it with quilting. His mom had a quilting blog or YouTube channel or something and he was doing XYZ. Next thing you know, fast forward whatever 10 years, they have a city in the United States that people fly to and it is the quilting capital of the world or whatever and they own all the buildings and they have a shop that's all about the quilting stuff and they have one that's all about the metal and this and they have like all this stuff and people fly into this city that's in the middle of nowhere and the guy owns like 80% of the buildings in the town and has turned it into Disney World and it's like it started with info coaching small ecom thing and now they're a hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year So, it's like you can take any of these to the nth. It's just like which one wealth factory was Gunner uh was what's his name? Gunderson. Gunderson book. Uh Garrett Gunderson. He sold this. So Garrett Gunderson is the guy who wrote Killinga Sacred Cows and like this was his big book and like what would the Rockefellers do? And these were book funnels that he wrote in order to get people into Wealth Factory. And then he sold Wealth Factory. I feel like the only thing nowadays is like majority of people don't have the patience to do that. Like that's that's a total long-term game. Yeah. This is a total long-term game. But it's like, right, so they're just using a classic book a call funnel and then where does this web? You have no idea, right? But this is their entry point. And when they used to have it, they had 19 different courses. is I mean I'm sure I have a login for this. Oh no, they moved it on site. Yeah, portal, right? So they moved it all on site after they per got purchased. But these guys are essentially doing like a more direct version of um Oh, here's another one. Paradigm wealth or life or something. Paradigm life, I think. Yeah, these guys are another version of this. So it's this guy right here. He has books. He has whatever. And it's whole life insurance, ILs, like all these financial products in the back end. And it's the same thing. It's talk to an expert. It's a call funnel that comes through. And then they have courses where they sell products. That's any of their stuff. Sells these different things. So they have products right here. And then they have like full book funnels, full whatever. You walk through here, it educates you so much before you can even book a call. And then these are very high commissionable products. Well, long-term care products, premium financing, whole life term isn't that high. Annuities are right off the rip. And different ones have different qualification process. Your your time from lead to purchase or commission on like this is like instant on this is long on this is kind of instant long. And again, this isn't fully my game. So, I'm probably stepping out of my tone right here, but yeah, this is an example. Another example. I'll uh I'll pick a few questions from the chat I think are most relevant, but uh what's your opinion on organic versus ads in early stages like pre 100K a month uh content ecosystem versus VSSN fun? Yeah, I think organic is like truly goated. It just takes too long. So, if you're trying to test and iterate, that's the other thing is like who you've built into your organic audience or trying to test and like build up an audience in an organic thing is a lot harder. Um, if you want to shift your messaging or your target audience, it's much harder to shift, right? Because like you're building like true I have a sticky note here that's like every every one is someone and it's like it takes one like it's every addition is a different person that saw you in a different way versus an ad is directly targeted at a person very quick. You can spend five grand tomorrow and test like it's right now. So, we test with paid. Um, we've actually never in this business specific never like hammered organic other than for middle and bottom of funnel, but I talked to the guys like Eman and whatever, which is like a longer tail game, but it crushes and you get 30 to 40% more margin when you do organic because you're doing 3x rorowaz and you're just lighting that cash on fire or ideally not on fire, but to get 3x back or 5x or whatever. So, I I like paid off the rip no matter what. Uh, paid while growing organic though. What? Paid while growing organic. Yes. Always. Always growing organic and brand. And I wish we would have done that sooner and better and optimized around it and shelled out the cash and used like marketing budget that you would have spent on ads for content organic team and like done that in a better way. We're doing that now, but you know, 70s something million later, not off the rip. We have like a couple videos that have popped off which is just annoying. We have so much content. Yeah. Okay. What are the best incentives/ bonuses for setters closure that you've tested so far? I know you guys have a pretty healthy uh bonus structure. Yeah. Um yeah, we're already kind of talking about how we're going to shift and change that and align it better because we want you want top performers to make top money, right? Like you want your top performers. So our top reps have made over 400 and something a year. Um we've had multiple that have hit that. So what is the cash collected amount versus what they should take home and like that game and then what is the what is top performance pay for somebody in that role right and backing into that. So a top rep is 400 grand let's just say in that number. So now how much cash collected can they do and then backing into the percents. So for us it's kind of pretty close to the classic 10% and then we have some bonus pools. Uh when we had everyone as 1099 we really needed coverage on the weekends. So we created basically that they would get like a a multiplier effect uh on the weekends. So they would open up more times on the weekends so we could get more stability because availability is an issue and that's hard to change ad budgets from 30K a day to 20K a day for just two days. So you're just kind of burning cash on either end, however you look at it. Uh either opportunity cost or literal cost. So for us the current model is 8, nine, and 10% based on how they sit uh on team. So basically what their sales per booking is which is a function of sale uh show rate and close rate. The what I want to move into and what ours is really kind of closely based off of is cash collection week overw week. So our pay periods are two weeks long. If it was weekly if it was monthly just do the same math and then figure out what your tranches are for cash collected and have different percents tied to those. So an example of that is like under 100k 100 to 200 and 200k plus let's just say and then you would have your anchors around that. So you'd have eight 8% 9% 10%. So as they hit the higher thing and were performing over that week, they would already be making more money, but now they get more as a percentage of it as they climb. And those are the most those are the most successful ones I've seen. And then mini contests like who can get the most units in a day. If someone can get, you know, a hat trick, they get a steak dinner, they can get their nails done, they do whatever. Like there's a bunch of those that randomly happen. Um but yeah, that's what we've seen for And then it like so how we actually actually our current state their W2 so they have a draw base of whatever the federal minimum is for the US 45 grand a year uh that is a draw. So as soon as they go over that in commission it's replaced by the commission not in addition right they're making their eight n or 10% and then we have bonus pools that are based on uh points which it gets kind of confusing but points are just one to one of cash collected and on the weekends it's 1.5x. So, we have like this point tracker thing that sits over here that like as they get to it, they get 3K, 6K, 9K, and 12K in bonuses for the pay period. Um, which shores out a little high honestly on uh on percentage of paid to sales team when the team is cruising, but like you want top reps to make top money. So, top rep and that'll make 14% call it when they hit everything, which is high. So is there like a maximum uh percentage you have in mind or on paper that you're like my dream state for the entire department is 15 points and that's just unrealistic right when you have all those people at that. So we're going to mess with it as we get more at scale because now that the reps are performing better uh we might have to adjust it a little but that's not really directly on the radar with all the other changes. Um I know sales agencies right now out of the box do 20% almost like like I know guys that do 20. I know guys that do 25. So if an agency does 20, why can't you do in-house? Ideally, you can do in-house and save money, right? It's like the idea. But the agencies have economies of scale with how they do sales management hires where they can have four or five and it drops as a percentage. So we have a we have a chief of sales, we have an outbound director, like a setter manager, we have all the setters, which we didn't have setters until 72 million. We zero. We only did closers and tons of volume. And then a closer team. So it's like those four comp plans when stacked on top of each other are 20ish% right now. Really? Okay. Um what is the onboarding process? That's ramp up time that you've seen that works best for closers as in like would be closers training closures the sales manager training one to one to manny. Yeah. So the initial flow is a group interview and then they get approved by the sales ops coordinator or in the past it's been the d the manager. Uh we're trying to centralize that. So the sales ops person sits between setter and closer and approves everyone as like the double check. They then begin the onboarding process and we have a talent experience manager that specifically does that. Um that's like her role. So she makes sure they're in the system. She does some like ramping. We have pitch decks basically like onboarding presentations they go through and then once they get through that they go over to um uh the sales op. They basically go into a dedicated Slack channel that's like an onboarding onboarding cohort and then they start to get their first calls. they will sit in that bottom bucket to start and we'll get like the DQ which is all leads just not the top top tier leads, right? So, they do get good quality in there. It's not to say we just throw them all [ __ ] We just like make sure the top leads get to the top sales reps and then everything else shores out between top and bottom. Um, and then yeah, we've bounced around with this number, but it's essentially what is your cost per booking and what is a fair amount of money to invest slash like at bats before you either pull the plug or they're ready to like full go. So for us that's danced around 50 to 80 callsish. Uh that is like that's a fair assumption. And if they can't get it turned around and start getting some sales from that and like some good metrics then and then of course all I don't want to say the soft stuff but like the activity level stuff. Are they showing up to all the meetings? Are they bringing their call recordings? Are they filling out their numbers? Are they you know taking good feedback? And there's a lot of oneto ones that occur. We do weekly oneto ones with the uh chief of sales for setters and closers. Um they have five meetings a week. So a daily huddle on weekdays um that occur and then the the first one is the only one different that's like expectations and you know projections for the week. Everything else is just tied back to that and the cadence is very number driven and around there. And I do want to quick touch on this but like we have the same sales team that we had two months ago. Um and we just got different sales management. And I this is no shame or [ __ ] on our past sales management or whatever. It's just kind of like an example of culture and how things are led. With the same sales team, the same lead flow, the same volume, the same call, everything. We went from 1.6 million to 3 million last month with a new sales manager with two less reps. What do you feel like he pulled differently? He came in and just completely set the tone of the energy, the expectation of hours, the expect the script they should use, the pitch deck, like all these things. But just off the rip of the energy shift and how we're now leading by numbers, people didn't know their close rates. People didn't know their offer rate. People didn't know like these kind of simpler things. They were getting calls reviewed at the same thing. And again, this is no [ __ ] on past management at all. This is just like an example of some of the things that can change when there's like a cultural and energy shift. And last month, we almost hit peak uh our our record for new cash collected. And this month we're definitely pacing our record which is crazy. Long-term five 10 year vision on the infospace direction with AI information that uh democratization uh trust bad players etc. Yeah. Um twofold. One I think that right now everything's already completely democratized and free on the internet completely. So I think you already can access anything on YouTube or in whatever way like can already do that. Um, but the new layer of AI has personalization that didn't exist before. So before you could find anything about any call funnel type or how to run this or that or do any of that stuff very easily. Um, but it wasn't applicable to you specifically in your use case. And now AI makes it so that is the case. You can take all the context of here's how this person talked about running a callunnel or this AI flow or this whatever workflows. you can feed that all in and then you can give it your specific use case and then it can marry those. So I do think that there's going to be a layer of info coaching that gets eaten or gets you know is gone because of that. Um, I think it would be unfair to realize not, but I think as being on the front of it with what we do is building it in right now where you can get it with efficiencies internally and use it to make more money now and then just making sure that you can do the same thing with product, right? is like you can do it internal to your product, but the second you start to show how the process works or how easy or light it is for you, like a really good and kind of s like funny example of this is like my dad has a landscape and storm removal company and they had guys that would shovel the sidewalk and it would cost $100 an hour to have those guys do it, right? They then got tractor things that could go on the sidewalk instead and it was one the cost. So example or the example there is like AI and I was like oh perfect now you can charge $25 an hour and like beat everyone. He's like no we're going to charge $100 still. We're just gonna it's going to be cheaper for us to fulfill on it. And it was like it was like 10 years ago when he said that to me and it like stuck so hard because I'm like oh so you get efficiencies through these things whether it's group coaching whether it's AI whether it's whatever. You can still charge the same rate because you're getting them the same result but it costs you less to do it right. So using it like that right now and then over time figuring out the way to use it in your actual product in a way that's like acceptable by the market or that you're leveraging all the expertise you have laid inside one of these AIs and then their personalization comes in. It's still I don't like you can get every Harvard class for free right now online and it's like people aren't going there. People are still paying people 10 grand to learn it because you have the experience because you've done it which is a biggest one because you have the modeled that information in an easy to consume way with a clear path from A to Z. So I think that's going to exist forever. Okay. Uh would it be applicable to run a low ticket ascension model for a B2B agency? No 100% do that. I know people who do that for templates is a big one. So people will be like, "Here's the SOPs that I use to consistently get clients for my agency or here's how I do it to, you know, only have five hours of management per client per month in my agency." And then people download these, you know, ClickUp board templates or notion temp or whatever. And then it leads them into booking a call on how to implement that in their company. And then it's like, "Okay, cool. Why did you buy just this little thing instead of apply for our like coaching?" And they're like, "Oh, it's your coaching." It's like, oh, well, every result on the website is from us personally building this into the companies because we actually add this, this, this, this, and this. I think the main um B2B in regards to to service based businesses. Yeah, same thing. Same thing. So, you should the niche down. So, like I use my landscape example. Um, Hormosi has one on this too. It's like a time management course can be sold like this and then you break it down to a time management for landscape professionals or landscape professionals that have one to 10 employees and you can sell it for more and be more unique with it. And yeah, that's definitely the model. You just have to niche down if you're going to do it in the service level. That makes sense. Okay. Have you tried lead forms? And if so, what was your experience at testing it? Facebook specifically forms in I assume. Yeah. So, yeah. Um, no, not for what we do here. Um, we I've done it in lead genen an affiliate um and done it for some localized stuff, but not for not for this because we want the consumption to exist. So like kind we've Yeah. No, not not at scale for us. I'm sure I'm sure it works. I actually know people who do it, but they do it more for when they have call centers and they have dials that they can do. Final questions, boys. I got time. So I have one on expanding on the uh B2B low ticket. Um so if your primary demographic is mostly BTOC, right? So guys starting service-based businesses. um how would you position that low ticket? Right? Because if you do like an SOP, yeah, the guys starting are going to also consume that, but technically you're kind of targeting more the guy who's doing between zero and 10K and he wants to systemize the business. And that's not mostly what your demographic is. So for someone who's 0 to 10K, they want acquisition, not systemization generally, right? Like lead genen. Yeah. Yeah. So like you're So you're saying you're tr the market your ICP is someone who's 0 to 10k to get into agency, right? No. So it's the offer is helping guys start service- based businesses like home services. Um it's going to be like window cleaning, permanent lighting installation, all that stuff. And so our primary demographic is going to be guys who are, you know, uh don't enjoy their job or they're looking to, you know, pivot career-wise uh or just looking to make some side income. And so they're starting out. So, for me, it's like, okay, well, we can make an easily sellable $9 SOP document, but that doesn't really Yeah. get assumed by that starter guy. Yeah. So, what's what's the back end off or what's the current full offer? Uh, it's ongoing mentorship and coaching at like a average 6 to 8K price point. Um, and we basically help you with everything like the services themselves, how to systemize, add uh SOPs, we'll help you with your lead genen. Um, but it's also very self-guided. So, it's like group coaching. Yeah. So, you want to pull away from that as much as possible. And what's the front front? What is the first thing that is in their head that you're solving for? So whether it is how to get your first client as a home ser like I don't know the necessarily the answer but it's like how to get your first client as home services how to make your first dollar doing this how to like I I've seen a lot of guys do like which is interesting to me that you're doing it as multiple home services because I've seen guys who crush it in like how to do a car detailing business right like how to start a car detailing one or how to start a window one they have the whole franchises that are around painting and all that kind of stuff and it's like picking your angle and finding the lowest because you want like you want it to be niche but you want it to work for cold. So you want it to be for someone as like the very first entry point. I don't specifically know what it is in your but if you break out your coaching thing and it's like where do they start right now and then just chunk that off as something you can sell. So, not an SOP, you're 100% right, but something that's like how to get your first client or how to um the 10 the 10step checklist to launch your home service business, right? Like checklist, stuff like that. That's like very easy to consume plug-andplay. Like that's what sells for $7 and 17 and 27. So, like here's your uh quick start your your your 12 bullet checklist to start a homebased business or a home services business or whatever and then sell sell that and then instantly have your uh you can on stuff like that that's a little bit different I think because it can make sense to have upsells and downells and to then you have to build out multiple products. Uh I do like the just direct ascension. So, it's like they buy that and then it's like now book on book your onboarding call so we can make sure you understand the things on this checklist and you have the you have the resources you need and drop them into a little portal and a free school gur group or whatever or I guess that's paid but a paid school group and then just have them all in there and then just nurture that and the call same thing that I said earlier which is like hey cool you got this but I didn't I see that you didn't actually apply for like our our coaching whatever like to do quick start whatever and they're like oh I didn't even know that existed and you're like yeah well everyone on the website all the case studies you see all the stuff everyone who's actually gotten And you know, a ton of like uh success in this has gone through our coaching program because we offer personalization onetoone and this and this and like they're like, "Oh, that's cool. Yeah, you want to talk to somebody?" And then they book them with the closer. Yeah. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. We've been floating the idea of like uh there's this these people that the offer owner saw recently. It's like subscription kings. um doing like a three-step ascension to where for us it would be okay make your first 500 bucks with home services and then ascend to make your first get your first $1,000 day and then you would that would be like the logical next step to okay now you're ready for coaching you know what I mean yeah we're looking at some guy's thing the other day this might have been you I don't know but someone was saying I think it might have been home services but they were like learn how to make $650 a day uh in home services and it was like someone would purchase it and then And we were looking at the Otto page. I It was yesterday actually in the in the video I put on YouTube. And then the next page was like ready to scale to 20K months like book your call. And it was like like the frame like made no sense. It was like what's 650 a day then monthly is what? Like that's what 18 grand. Like is that different? And it's like they haven't even done the thing in step one. They just purchased the thing to learn how to get to 650 a day. And then the Otto instantly is like ready to scale to 20K months. And it's like they don't even know what the 650 a day thing is. and you're jumping day versus month and like it just didn't make sense. So the flow is so important that I think that the ascension ones that crush it. We get 70% booked call rate from low ticket purchase to implementation call. So it's like you get all those people on the phone and can talk to your customers and then can change your low ticket because you hear this and this and you can change the framing or you can you know you get like so much feedback loop. That's why I love call funnels because you have so much room for error and so much like margin for and like feedback loop versus someone just lands on a page, buys something, you're like, "Oh, 2.2%. How do I make it 2.4?" It's like you have no true feedback loop. Yeah. Appreciate you, man. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good one. Good question. Anything else for Ryan, boys? Yeah, man. What's up, Ryan? What's up? I got a question. Um, how do you guys analyze sales calls and reverse engineer that into the funnel? Painstakingly. Um, it's much easier now with AI. Um, so we have HubSpot now out of the box, I think, has it or at least our plan has it. So, it'll give you AI summary of the call. Um, for the longest time in the OG days, it was like a feedback. It was basically the end of day reports. So, everyone submits their end-to-day reports. They go into one collection thing and then they just basically get pushed over to marketing like things that are highlighted. So, a sales ops or sales manager will find things and be like, "Oh, seven, excuse me, 70% of these are like broke or everyone keeps bringing up this thing where they're all talking about menopause all of a sudden instead of macronutrients or what you mean just the feedback loop." Now, we use Zoom revenue accelerator. We built an in-house tool that does the same thing, but it's basically like trans like calls done. You can do these end to end. You can do zap. You can do whatever. It's done. Feed it into AI. Give the summary points and then like act as a this this to say how would marketing change things based on this and then summarize those all into one and then resummarize them again and then fire that off to marketing. So we use Zoom revenue accelerator. It costs X amount of dollars. Gong did it for a really long time for like 100 grand a year. It was dumb. And then now you can do it yourself pretty easily. So you're separating that between the different parts of the business. That's interesting. Yes. What's the EOD forms that you have closers fill out? Because I'm sure that there's things that closers know that the Let me pull up their most recent. They have they have a new iteration one, but now the new manager is having them do it for every single call, drop the call recording link and drop their like notes and feedback on them into one form. So we standardize them through a jot form where they basically go through like how do they rank them, how many calls they do, like the inputs of like how many were on calendar, how many were live, how many were this or this instead of putting it in the spreadsheet like the closer IO one. So they fill that all out and it pushes into there and then there's the box that's down in the bottom that's like the contextual feedback and they fill all that in and then those all go into one master like log and then from there you can AI that entire log. Okay, cool. That's interesting. Yeah, I want to visualize that but that sounds super helpful. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's basically standardize the inputs. So, make a form in simple words, make a form, then have those all go into a database, a sheet or whatever, and then you can literally manually if you want, just grab all of them, feed them in somewhere, and then be like, give me the top keywords. Like for us, one of the examples was we did this with the customers in the end, and we're like, what is the uh what are like common words they use? What are this, this, and this of like a ton of feedback forms and a ton of them were saying like empower women, which is so interesting, right? because that's like it was kind of in our language but wasn't really and like that was a key thing is like oh this just a group of empowered women. It's like, "Oh, okay. Let's layer that messaging now up on the front and then the throughput is like right there." Or like we were doing things around um a lot around macronutrients because that was kind of hot for a minute and then all of a sudden we started to see things pick up around menopause, per menopause, where they're at with that stage. Menopause specific funnel 7x rorowaz instead of 3x like right. So like the feedback loop was like real. Yeah. Super cool. I love that. That's sick, man. uh as one. Yeah. Just uh I have uh one question for you. So I see a lot of guys online including guys like Brian Marada and Jeremy Haynes which really knows their stuff, right? Uh who talks a lot about hammering people with emails prior to uh people actually attending the call like in the framing window, right? And I've just been thinking about it and if it were any of my clients or if I were to sign up for something, I would be so annoyed if someone like spammed me with 15 emails and I've never seen anyone done it and I've funnel hacked hundreds of funnels. So what is your experience with that? Because I generally just send her everything in one page and then I just keep redirecting them to that one page where I have all of the information, right? Testimonials, pre-objection handling material, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So, I wish I had clean data for you and I don't, but I can give you soft data on this. So, we did this. So, we did every two hours after they after they booked a call, we hammered them with emails every two hours and we got some feedback that it was too much definitely. Um, but if you think of it in the scheme of things, we're booking 100 to 300 to five, whatever, 100 calls a day. And like if you're only hearing it a couple times like so I know as a consumer. So here's a great example. I booked a call with these ops kings guy and I was like I need their very basic website not allowed to consume. They redirected me they to nowhere when I booked a call. They then sent me an email and said sometimes the page is broken. Click here to go to the page. I click there page is broken. I email them back and say send meing everything you have before this call. Because as like an educated consumer and in like this B2B land, like I need to know everything before I make a decision and I don't want to sit on the phone with you for 45 minutes or an hour and have you like pitch me like where I'm at as a consumer or like this B2B land. Yeah, makes sense. That's not super common for BC at all. Right. They But the idea behind it is you're getting ahead of anything that could happen on the sales call so that by the time they're on the sales call is basically just like an onboarding, right? And that does not work for everyone because there needs to be a sales process sometimes to get people over the line and they're not just going to sell themselves through this education. So where we landed is we have two layers of this. So he has the ads side of things and he has the automation side of things. So on ads we do have the hammer them strategy that he talks about. So we have 15 pieces of content that are long form that are authority driven that are uh reviews long form testimonials all that stuff. And we have however many of those. They exist for people on a HubSpot sync list that have booked but have not had a call disposition yet. Right? So it's like booked calls within that 48 hour window. So that's anywhere from 200 to 400 people call it and then they get hammered with these ads. When they get a through play of one ad, they are now moved to the next and removed from that one. So they see a different ad over and over again, but you own their feed. You are everywhere you're on. And then we do the same thing on YouTube and uh on Pmax and everything. So we're everywhere on Google as well, our two core ones that we use. So we'll do that. And we saw a direct in increase when doing that. The next layer was the emails every two hours or so. So we send contextual emails and reminders from the sales rep specific from their email and their dedicated line. We have a setter reach out to them and call them and confirm the call. And then all those other emails that come every two hours are like authority and review driven whatever. And those are sending from the branded company email. So not to be like hammering from the sales rep. So they'll go from there directly and go through. Um, but yeah, so every two hours, I'm sorry, every two hours was too much for us and every four hours we've not heard a single message and we only send it on uh good hours because the whole thing is with email. It I have an actually terrible example of this, but we did this with text. So when we heard about that for the first time, we did it every two hours via text message and you would have thought we were like like harming families. Like that was not the move. text people are going to see like text people are going to see every two hours, four hours. An email, you know how many emails they get and like bounce through and they'll pick the one they want to see and they'll skip over the next one. Like email is not that big of a deal. That's why I even think two hours is not that big of a deal. Even if you get a couple complaints like, "Oh, you emailed me 90 times. I don't want to talk to you anymore." It's like, "Okay, then don't talk to us because we're aggressive and we like it anyway." Like, depending how you are, but if you do it via text or call or some of these other ones, no bueno. So, it's like ads easiest to get away with. Email second easiest to get away with. And then text and phone are like not even close. Okay. And do you redirect within the specific emails to the same page where they have all of the information? So the initial initial three will go through there and it's the classic like your calls now confirmed but you have to watch this video the proper frame video. Go to Alen Sultanic stuff. He talks about how to frame the video in a good way. And then it's pre-objection blocks or I'm sorry it's then it's here's what to expect. We're going to call you in the next five minutes from a XYZ uh area code. The call is make sure you know it's Zoom. Um, make sure you pop into your email and see an email like this and confirm it from an unknown sender. And then it's pre-objection blocks. It's the three core objection blocks that are the brand face being like how much does it cost? What do you mean how much does it cost? How much does it cost you to, you know, be overweight and do this and this and this and like do all that kind of stuff. And then like how does this work? How does whatever? And then it's just a testimonial wall. So we have mid form and long form that then exists within there. And that's all on one page. So the first three emails are going to point them back to there. And then there are other standalone pages that exist that are like a headline with a specific video and then testimonials with no buttons. You're not trying to take them anywhere. Okay. And do you send them via Calendarly or you use a totally different uh Yeah, we use Cali. Okay, makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I have looked at other tools, but we have so many integrations inside Calendarly. I have likeund and something zaps that are connected to which is a nightmare. But yeah, I've heard I closed is really really good for drop offs. really good because you get the the drop um because you basically get the application not built or whatever it is the other way around which is really nice. Um yeah, I like Cali personally. I think that a UI is the best. I hate HubSpot. I hate Acuy. I hate GHL. Um but they all work. It's like we talked about it yesterday as an example. Like you could have the ugliest sales page of all time that the buttons are broken and if you have the best offer and your and your address on the bottom like people will mail you to try and buy it, right? like think of it like that. But yeah, the cleaner the better. So the top top people use I I guess determines how you mean top but uh type form and calendarly are like the out of the box ones that most people use. Jeremy Haynes talks about that and embeds the calendarly inside the uh type form. Yeah. That's why he's like, "Oh, we have 100% uh app to booking ratio." And it's like, well, yeah, obviously they're inside one. Like I think it's so funny when he says that. Ours is like 60%. So, we'll have a 100 people that fill out an application. We'll have 60 people that book a call. And those 40 spread then live in a like app no book list that get emails that get dialed by uh setters that have all that nice. Final question, Ryan. When you boys when you guys had a tough period with ads, what did you feel like went wrong in recent like six 12 months? Um after like being educated necessarily, um what did you feel like went wrong with the ads and how did you fix it? Yeah. So, it was more so the acquisition system than it was the ads. Um, it was also the ads like how our entire ad account was structured was just like just we were just pressing it too hard. We were not diversified around things. You know, 70% of the spend was landing on similar creative because that was the one that won. Not to say we weren't testing other stuff because we were, but we were all we were hammering it all through one funnel and we did it too aggressively and over too short of an amount of time. So spending into the one we did with one VSSL funnel was not the move. So now where we're at right now, we have completely restructured the ad account. So like the entire structure of it and what we're optimizing for, purchase, schedule, different campaigns for that. And then the big thing is that VVS thing I talked about in the beginning where we have three different funnels. So they can come through and see different things and not just get hammered through one VSSL opt-in funnel and a ton of emails. They can enter through here direct app that has different messaging a little bit. They can enter through load ticket that has this. And we created more of like an ecosystem, not just one point of failure, which essentially is what happened. We had one ad account that was spending incorrectly and kind of structured wrong, but you couldn't turn it off because we need to keep calendars full. And then we had one funnel that you can only optimize so much that was getting a good cost per on stuff, but like we just hit it too hard. It's like it's not not to say it was fatigued, but like it was kind of fatigued for the for the pocket of audience that we're targeting. How do you differentiate in scaling to delegation versus self-learning? How do I differentiate delegation versus self-learning? As in like how do you identify what you want to pay to learn versus like what you hire from? Um yeah, when you're when you're scaling um that that has probably been a big error that was also the error of marketing was marketing was led by the other co-founder and me doing all the marketing tech and builds. So he was the mind behind it and like he even spent up until we were spending like 20k a day or more. Um when it he was writing the ads, he was doing that. Um so we needed to delegate that team out when we started to make more money earlier for longevity and scale and full like eyes and dedication on it. Um that was a big one that we didn't do um that we should have done earlier. So I don't know because I like to have I'm kind of under the belief personally of like understanding things well enough that you can delegate them. So getting your like expertise on a topic enough that like you know if an ad is good for example before you hire out someone to make your ads or like you know how the metrics or to run ads at x amount of scale to know if your media buyer is doing a good job or you know whatever how to coach in a good enough way to know that if your coach is coaching correctly right like at some level you need the experience or you need somebody who has the experience between you two. Um that's kind of our example of how we've done things with our you know chief of people chief of product like she was a coach then she led all the coaches and then she became chief product chief people. Um that's not something that like you can hire for though right? She like built the experience internal. Um I just last week hired a marketing tech for the first time. Like I have done all the marketing tech up until last week. So that is another example of like too late to the party but I can run circles around anybody in marketing tech. So, it's like I, you know, I just have him send me things now and I can approve them in two seconds because I know if I would do it like that or like that. So, that was uh that like we still pay for education non-stop. We pay to deploy things. We pay for education then have team deploy things. Um, right now I'm skipping our ops whatever meeting thing uh to be on here where they're going through basically a data restructure and tech and whatever and I'm having them record it and send it to me because like I still want my eyes on it and I don't want them to just full run it without me. So like I'm closer but like I still I still have eyes on that stuff. Okay. So you believe in to an extension of always self-educating and not just fully delegation without blind delegation to an extent. Yeah. Unless you can operate it in a way that like the person has experience in it already is a big difference between someone who's just like running it like almost all of our team has built experience through doing it in our team not coming with experience from external. It's a lot different if you hire someone that's you know our CSO for example has run 100 person sales teams. I have not run 100% sales team. So like my expertise is much lower than his. So there's a little bit more like hands off that can occur with someone like that versus like blind trust essentially in someone who comes in that's like I can run your sales team and they've had five sales reps under them and now they can run a team of 20. It's like you got to have eyes on it way more. Um my marketing tech just came from publishing.com built our exact tech stack and did 100 million a year through his systems. So, like I'm pretty I feel pretty good about him being able to, you know, structure my data, but I still am doing a checkpoint to make sure it like meshes with us because it's two weeks onboarding or whatever. Yeah, 100%. I don't want to take up any more of your time, Ryan. Um, yeah, it's been it's been a pleasure, but does anyone have any final questions before we wrap it up? I see one down here. The what percentage of your leads you convert to apps in the opt-in funnel and how many% of those apps come directly from the VSSL versus the mail flow? That's a little difficult to directly track. Um, I've run this gambit 90 times of trying to like direct solve for that. The percentage of here, let me just give you literal exacts because I don't want to give you a rough number. But like monthto date, for example, what's today? The 10th. So if I was to go today, the lead to app 30%. That's total, right? That's total total total blended. Now, that also introduces people that are direct that are whatever. But yeah, so we'll get, you know, let's call it 10,000 leads. We'll get 3,000 apps and we'll get 1,700 calls. Okay. So essentially around 15% of the leads get into calls. Okay. But that's benchmark as well, isn't it? Mhm. Approximately. Yeah. But our number forever has been oneish% of leads purchase which is terrible. Um but the math maths because of how we have so much consumption. So our we didn't really talk about this much, but our automations like hammer them. Like you want to talk about too many emails like we have opt we have opt no app. We have app no book. We have book not taken. We have no show cancel. So those are all contextual flows that are going to exist that are once a day emails that are value value in these directions. And then we have um twice a day emails that go out every single day, seven days a week for the last four years that go out to the whole list. Anybody anybody who's on the open hot list, which is hundred something thousand. So we're sending six million emails a month. That's crazy. Have you ever tried to six million emails a month? Yeah, I think it's Have you ever Have you ever tried to add the phone number and then dial the leads within five minutes to see how high you could get the percentage? Once once and uh the tradeoff was a 20some percent down um down in uh opt-in rate. So call it instead of getting you know 100, we were getting 80 and we weren't using the phone numbers to get the uptick. So it actually was a decrease overall. So because that's on us and our system was not built in a way. We tried to do it through AI. We built an entire in-house AI messaging platform that sends through send and like does all this stuff and we still use it to this day on app notebook but we don't use it on ops because it just has never converted for us well enough. Um we want them to take that action on their own um a little better. Now it is different with somebody who does like low ticket for example and doesn't book like we'll dial those right because they're hotter people but someone who just opted in for the training thus far we haven't built a system that makes sense to take the decrease in uh ops for the payoff of trying to get more apps through them like the math has never mathed and you managed to dial them within like I don't know what the speed to lead time on average was not correctly not correctly or 247 we have I mean because again to do that for us is like to flip it over. It's all of a sudden it's like, hey, now you have 800 phone numbers to call a day on top of all your other ones you have. And it's just like there's never been a time where we've been like, hey, let's just build a team and like test this for 14 days where we're just going to 800 new dials a day. Like even right now, we're talking about building out like a proper outbound team. We have 24 setters and they're barely managing the inflow before that. And they haven't even hit the 300,000 phone numbers in the CRM. like they're only hitting the ones that become app no books or low ticket not uh per not doing uh implementation calls or no show cancels or like if you look on our uh um our booking page we have like a no time works for you fill out this custom time request we'll have 15 of those a day that then setters claim the no like there's so many pockets the auto sets that come from low ticket our 15-minute zoom calls and fully pack their days like it's been a it's it's become a people thing more than anything that is like do you think AI AI upon is [ __ ] Yes. Mhm. You think it always will be or think it can evolve? No. No. No. No. I think we're six months away or whatever. I can't wait. I can't wait. I have an my AI textbot thing that we built that is custom is essentially like the Max AI. M AX.AI I think is the name of their company. We use them, but it was like five grand a month. We built it in-house for like hundreds of dollars a month. And it was sending through Alaware. And it would be like, "Hey, so we named her Mandy." Mandy Macros. It' be like, "Hey, so and so, this is Mandy." And it's after they get the application. So it consumes all it ingests all their application. It knows everything about us and then it's trying to push them to book a call. So it's like hey I see that you tried you know Jenny Craig in the past but this and this like what was your main holdback? Or it we have an entire database that scraped our whole site and it'll be like oh I see that you're 52 and have tried this and this. Here's a great resource on the site that I think you might like. And it'll link them dynamically to something on the site. And then they have conversation back and forth and then it's like I think you'd be a great fit. Click here to book. And that was 12% of our bookings. So you're talking likeund and something bookings a week, 150, 200 bookings a week for a long time and then setters like ate her cake because they're hitting the same app no book pool. But like if we could roll her out somewhere else, we tried her on email, didn't work. But we tried AI voice one time and we tried it on booking confirmations. So we were trying to make it so postbooking they would get dialed and get their like, hey, you know, this is a Zoom call, you know, it's central time zone, you know, whatever. And it would do that. Um, but it didn't work for us because the AI couldn't handle all the contextual questions. Didn't sound real enough. Like, it'll be there, though. It'll 100% be there. Like, I've I've listened to other people's, but they're always like simpler. They're always, you know, a reservation or order food to go or whatever, and like those work because they can like look up a database, look back. Um, but for us, the the context just didn't make sense. And maybe we built it wrong, but we used like a Y Combinator company that was XYZ, and they built it out and they still couldn't get it to work. So sick. Well, you know what? One last question. Yeah. Um, fellow American here. How you doing, Ryan? How are we doing? Doing great. Um, love the love everything that you shared so far today. Um, I run a B2B cold email agency for service based businesses in the US and I have like so many um, ideas. I I guess just hearing your system of sales, all the funnels um that you're running right now, I want to start tackling them through. And of course, you want to do everything all at once, but I'm guessing aside from my one main funnel of cold email, and we get fantastic referrals consistently from our clients, too. Um, what would be one that you would I guess look forward to run first if you wouldn't start with like a combination of them? DTAunnel. So I would do so we did we did this in the past where we ran a DTA funnel style for the insurance thing and we did it through LinkedIn messaging. So the initial iteration of that was him he was an architect that then turned life insurance agent. So we modeled the entire thing around that. So it's called cash flow architects. It was here's how you do your XYZ. I don't even know how you say it. It's like some ex something session that's like an architecture word. The entire VSSL was all about architecture. Like it was this whole thing. And then we went on LinkedIn. We just targeted architects. Changed his profile to be all about how he was a past architect turned life insurance rep. And then we just cold cold automated DM'd on LinkedIn and pushed people to the VSSL. It's all we did. It was like, "Hey, do you get a chance to check out the training?" Like start a conversation, push them to a DTA funnel, which was a headline, a VSSL, and apply button. And we got so many applications. the percentage throughput was disgusting. And then we realized that architects are broke and they don't fit the demo for what he's trying to sell as the product because he only had one product to sell them, which was this insurance thing. And we didn't do it the right way where we could have sold some architecture info product thing for life insurance and then had some long game. But we just picked the wrong niche. But the process worked phenomenally. Phenomenally. Okay. The DTA funnel is the easiest if you have traffic that's in a way that like at some level is already interested or is niche specific or whatever. It's literally a headline, a VSSL, and an applicationbooking. It's all it is. Two pages, three pages money. Okay. And I want to roll in uh low ticket like I have I have one that I'm building right now something that's like uh we just got someone a recurring uh contract for over 100,000 a year and I was going to say like three line email for 100 thou like used to generate $100,000 recurring work. Um where would you use that? Would you go like an ad directly to sign up? Yeah. So, you're going to sell the script. Yeah. Like Yeah. Yeah. So, it just be Yeah. Just be a long form page and then Yeah. Either add whatever source. I mean, it could be I mean, [ __ ] you could do cold email. I mean, you can do whatever traffic source. You can do ads, you can do organic, you can do whatever. And then either sell it for seven bucks or give it away or whatever. and then just have a simple page with some sales copy down it, some examples, some case studies. Look at uh Automatic Clients. They're the best at selling the low ticket stuff. Automatic clients.com is uh all sultanic and he is like all about that. Perfect. And he has templates and all that kind of stuff. And his course is 27 bucks or something and then it does the classic upsell trump thing until it's 35k whatever. But he g he gives away all of his stuff for free inside uh the Facebook group. So, he has a ton of stuff on that. But, yeah, the plug-and-play systems are the best things that you can sell for seven bucks, 27 bucks, whatever. That's here's my plug-and-play threeline email that landed me $100,000 client. And then you can either do a quick little VSSL thing and then an application, or you can direct sell it. You could use that exact example for any type of these acquisition methods, sold or application or whatever, dude. Incredible. Thank you so much. So, we'll wrap it up there, Ryan. We really really appreciate your time and you know um all these guys are between I think Tamir you're still 16 or what? Uh 17 two months. 17 two months. So being 16 and um I think the oldest me have here is maybe grandad Noah I don't know maybe Mike I don't know 26. Um, I don't know. But yeah, young group of guys and I know you're young yourself as well, but uh we really really appreciate hopping on because the world that we live in uh day in day out is full of like phonies to be honest. Um, you know, you just talk [ __ ] and flex uh a certain perception rather than actually knowing what they're talking about. And it's really a breath of fresh air to have someone come on who actually knows what the [ __ ] they're talking about. And it's uh it's very very clear to see. And so we appreciate that. that allows all of our guys to think bigger and um to realize like we actually know football [ __ ] all compared to what we shouldn't need to know. H so we really appreciate you hopping on brother and we wish you the the best of luck with everything you're doing with the YouTube and the the content, the branding and everything you're doing for yourself as well. And um yeah, enjoy it, bro. I really appreciate it. Yeah, I appreciate you guys reaching out. These are uh these are fun. I'm old in the game now. I'm 28 and I started in this when I was probably 19. I bought my first course thing and then started with Warrior Babe and building pages and learning this when I was 22 probably and [ __ ] off for a lot of years, right? Honestly, like we made some cash and then just kind of just thought it was cash flow and was doing a million million things and it's only been over the last year or so 27 28 that we took this thing like really seriously and tried to scale into it. So yeah, you guys all start in this age and all the people I'm meeting on X and YouTube and whatever are all young guns, 20s, even third, whatever that are or teens that are just cooking. So it's great to see. It's just what you just said, like there's a lot of fluff and [ __ ] and scammy and short-term thinking that a lot of these people have that I think communities like this uh help avoid that. So I appreciate you guys. you had like if you had a few sentences to say to that younger version of yourself you were just talking about what would they be? Oh man. Uh I someone asked me this on one of these on the Q&A and it was like in two words or whatever and I was like sit the [ __ ] down and shut up I think was what I said. Uh but I just like stand by that like dude I had such an ego like I started making a couple hundred grand like a month probably at that range and like it was and and by and all to say that was like this that was like in waves. It wasn't like, "Oh, cool. Now I make a couple hundred grand a month and it stays like that." It was like some winds and then it was like some troughs and then it was some winds and it was like, "I'm partying. I'm doing this. I'm that. I'm living over here. I'm trying to like figure out tax zones." And it's like don't even make like just so classic like like exactly what you see not to do. I had heard not to do it and I still did it. And don't take your sales person that's the best and make him the manager. I'd heard not to do it and we did it. It's like read every book on this shelf. And I just couldn't learn until I did it myself. And so yeah, so I had huge I had a huge ego. Um I would say stop that at the door. I don't care who you are. People respect the opposite of the flashy [ __ ] Um I don't like it on social really either. Like I like through and through just like as transparent as real as a human as you can be and sticking to that uh case studies and results and stuff like you can be proud of that by not being a douche. You can be proud of your numbers. You can say, "Oh, we did 75 million and I have friends that do five times that." And like it's not for ego, right? It's like just to like have some authority. Yes. By not being a douche though and being like, "Check out my 75 and like this and this and no one can beat us and like it's just it's just a shortterm game." So thing I would say to myself is shut up and sit down and keep working and think long term because I definitely thought very short term back then and longterm does not necessarily mean hormone 10ear stuff like he probably know he knows a lot better than I do. Um, but you don't have to think necessarily in 10 year windows. You can think in one and three year windows and still act a lot differently than if you're thinking in month windows. That that's great. I appreciate it, Ryan. Um, cool, guys. Yeah. In a bit. Thanks very much, Ryan. Best of luck. Thanks for coming. Talk soon.
