# no mics. no scripts. just what's working... (raw Q&A) | E50
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSc0AhgBO0

In today's video, we are going to be doing something different and just do random Q&A with some random people I met at this event. All right, starting it off. What is one thing that's working right now in marketing, online biz, ops, any other things? Low ticket ascension offers. Low ticket ascension offers. Not an SLO. SLO selfquidating offers when people run you through like [ __ ] seven or eight upsells and downells to squeeze all the juice out of your ass. roll of it. Yeah. No, finding smart people is working. But low ticket ascension offer is you're you jam all the AOV into the checkout step and then you go right to the call because then you get 80% of people to book a freaking call after they buy and then it cuts your CPA to acquire a client. Like so you're not you're not doing upsells or anything. You're just trying to push everything in the cart. Not even right now. But yeah, but we will put everything on the Chico page. It'll be like radio button upsells. How many? Uh, two. But you can have three. I've seen people have five radio button upsell before. And I've had up to three add-on like order bumps, but I've seen one or two does best, though. Yeah. Next. Next. Who else got one? What's finding finding smart people and good people is working. It's a I think a timeless strategy. It's definitely working now. Where do you find them? Where do you find them? I made a whole video on this. Yeah, my Twitter. No, I made a whole video on this talking about private versus public hiring versus like sources. Like if you're hiring copyriter versus an HR director, like the nothing held back group, for example, is like this pocket of like people you can hire for this, but then you're not going to hire 92 other positions that, you know, from that. And then having good [ __ ] When you have good [ __ ] it's easier. Yeah. Good brand, good known. Yeah. It's have something substantial and be talented yourself. All right, Cody, what do you got that's working now? You're you're the only one that's not as online marketing e I'm not a online markete guy. Uh so I'm just going to go with just something like tactical and just like on the topic of hiring. So I'm just going to I'm just going to take that uh and run with it. So I would say something that that working and that I learned the hard way was correctly like giving the right titles to roles in your company. You know, a lot of times when I'll work with companies and it's like you go in and they're doing 700 grand a year and it's like they got a CFO, a CEO, a CMO, and a COO, but they're really just like a bunch of task runners. And so it's like I think it's important that you like actually properly give the right title because it's bad for the person and it's bad for you because if you if you you know hire your cousin and she's your bookkeeper and you call her your CFO then when you get to 3 million a year she can't do any CFO stuff and then you have to either fire her or downgrade her role which is also not fun to do. So um just correctly titling roles for the functions you actually do. I like that one. Solid. And in classic fashion, I'm not gonna dox or say anyone's name or anything or say what anyone does. Cody Barton. He's rich and successful. All right, we got that. Uh, what color is your lab? Yeah. What color is your label? One thing that's been working super well for Ascension. Uh, this is sending me into software to book a call. Anything is I I just call it like the one hour fast start cuz sometimes when people buy like a ebook or like a low ticket product, they don't actually consume it. So what people do is have like a video series to try to teach the philosophies and then sell them, but no one would even watch that. So what I do is I run a campaign. You could do it evergreener uh once a month, but we just say like, "Hey, you probably bought this thing. You probably didn't go in and watch it. We can actually see the stats. 90% of you didn't, but we want you to win so bad that we're hosting this workshop. It's one hour long and we're going to teach you everything you need to know to get started in one hour." So we get them on there. We teach them. It's a teaching webinar. You can it's pretty much like a normal webinar free and then yeah it's free just for buyers and so it's all buyers there and at the end you make your pitch say like hey this was great you know just like before you probably you might not do anything with this so get our done for you thing or get coaching get accountability whatever and so we just run those and then so I was talking to this other guy and he started doing one a week so there's four different calls and four main topics that are taught inside of that product and they're evergreen so you can use stealth webinar um I use I'm starting to use a events that's a Good one. And so buyers are getting a live stimulated Zoom call and you get on a Zoom call and a live. So you run it live once. Good idea. You record it and then but it looks like a Zoom. Yeah, it's on Zoom. It's called a Yeah, it's a high. So I talked to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A event. They work way better. Yeah. They're way better converting higher webinar jam easy web like because it's Zoom. So people like oh it's a Zoom call. We should jump on your thing on cuz also fitness it's like you not our Yeah. And at the end it's like, well, you flip it. It's the easiest argument to the back end because it's like, here's the thing. You had all this information in the course you bought, but you didn't do anything about it. What's going to change tomorrow? Book this call. Accountability. What's working for you right now, Ryan? Uh, well, you guys are on the same team as me and those two things are working. So, finding good people. The Ascension Funnel. Anyone who watches, anyone who's on this channel knows that the Ascension funnel is crushing for us right now. What else is working for us right now? What about your other fun? Like your other funnel is it still working fine? Your VSSL book call VSSL's. Yes. But we're using Blake's Sorry I do you. Uh you're uh using your value vortex situation. The one that's not working for us right now but like secretly is is the DTA. That'll that will which is our direct to app funnel, but I talk about that a ton. But no, here that actually rolls into this. Good. So the next one is what go-to tool or system are you using that's quietly driving results? So like that was a fire one. I didn't even know about that. Yeah. What about the thing you told us about the the lead content campaign? Yeah, I mean that's that's working right now is just bottom of funnel nurture towards leads and and apps who are um who have come through your funnel and are likely to book a call as far as like getting higher quality book calls in a sense, right? because you brought that up earlier which is like we were talking about like is that actually influencing it and I thought about that a little bit more which is we cut down the VSSL from like a longer VSSL to a lot shorter but one thing that I think to go back to your question was I think in a sense it is helping the lead nurture to book calls because there's a trust factor or a trust recession around leads who have gone through other coaching programs in the past and are worried about booking a call because they know that a call is not a strategy call, right, or a blueprint call, it's a sales call. So, I think the it can be in a sense like I I I do would like to dig into that data, but I am curious like if the people who are leads but haven't booked but have gone through the app, it's like getting the quality. Yeah. Yeah. It's getting the quality to book. So, this is like so everyone so everyone understands he's saying. So, I I've talked about like the hammer them. Shout out Jeremy Haynes. He talks about that where you're basically running testimonials, pre-objection block, stuff like that as video views between when someone's booked and when they get on the phone call. He's talking about doing it prior to the phone call for people to get on. But still no like retarget where you're sending them to directly to book. You're just literally just in their face all the time with what kind of content? Just belief shift, objections, whatever is going to come up on the sales call basically. That's interesting. Authority content. authority content speaking on stage. Yeah. So like this is interesting like we don't do this. So like us rolling this out could be like a two five 10% lift and like that's opportunity. Opportunity lift, dude. And then I think just like a timeless thing to bring up too is it is shocking how many people because I did some cult consulting with people who are trying to scale like some low ticket funnels or VSSLs or whatever and it's shocking to me how many people don't actually run like financial models or economics on their funnel and they're like oh I need better ads. I need more creative. I need whatever. And it's like, do you really need that? Is it just like CRO? What are you doing? Oh my god. Get out of here. That was cloud chasing. Oh my god. Okay, that's good. No, but what else? Tools, systems, like tech. So, that was a good one. That's like a a tactic that would probably crash for us. I could plug another one. I mean, I got two ready, so go for it. All right. Uh, one we're we're going to roll out more is Hero Pixel just data enrichment. Uh, one thing we're going to try GTpper, it's a chat GT rapper. Uh, it's Faceless Digital. No, I'm joking. Um, but what we're going to try is after someone opts into our webinar. It's like what if before they go to the automated on demand version, we can pull their like see their how much they're making and based on how much they're making, we send them to a webinar where at the end there's a specific payment plan or financing or pricing that fits best for them. So, we're going to be rolling that out and segmenting it, but it's good for book a call. Just Hero Pixel. Oh yeah. Yeah. We we don't use it right now, but those lead guys um Douglas, they do that too. And we were talking about doing that, but we only thing that we would do for that is arm the sales reps with the data because we don't collect the phone number. You need name, email, phone number in order to pull it. So you'd either have to do it for us either post application or post purchase of the low ticket. And you can't real time route them. you like kind of can, but you have to do like a loading screen and all that stuff, which like it just seems like overkill right now. So, just give the sales reps to know how much total credit they had, how much like basically what's currently on there, and then also they have like this weird blended metric that's like what they could access for like a firm or CLA or whatever. We don't, but we for sure want to use it. It's like you either do it with more volume so you segment the leads you want to hit or you do it like you're saying like postpurchase for ascension or we'll just like scan our list before we do a webinar and then just we do like activation campaigns and we only run it to people who can afford it. So imagine you're only emailing people who can afford your backend offer. That's a good one. And it's just freaking you go all right guys. You only send it to them. You're like yeah. So you can get very specific because in today's age where whatever money isn't as accessible supposedly to people or they need to pay in different ways then I feel like it's going to be a big to segment where you're sending these people based on how much they can afford. Yeah. Because then it's not going to scare them away because even if you do a webinar we pitch the there's payment plans we pitch the 997 we see people bounce off because they're immediately afraid. But imagine if they jump on and we have a price point or payment plan that makes sense to them there and so the conversion rate will go up. We may not lose them as much or they won't be in the chat being like what the freak like like we even we saw I saw like Iman Gazi's recent launch he did when they dropped the price at 1,500 which isn't even that much like a business opportunity. The chat was just like they're all piss you know getting mad. Yeah. Have a video of it and obviously it's YouTube. public that doesn't reflect the the launch is crazy, but it just shows people's like me like what the they forget the bonuses and like what the heck they all mad. So this cost money. Someone at dinner last night was talking about how someone had like a call it 300ish product that was direct to cart and they blasted and did like over 20 and like did over 20 million just like pink doing that not on even like a live video series launch nothing like literally just a launch mid l and I was like what just like direct access and then community that's like just like evergreen not even like drip or nothing like that's wild one other thing I just thought of just on launches is um we so over the past year we've run challenges every month for one client. And one thing that we started to do for pre-qualification and also for show rates was just getting people to go through a quiz on the thank you page. That was that people do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Why do they do it? Yeah. So, it's we Yeah, we'll build a score app on the thank you page, but we kind of like rigged the the score app to be no one can get over like 65 or 70%. In terms of like their score and the quiz is framed as like a pain thing. So, it's like discover your own discovery. It's like discover how likely you are to build muscle or whatever and it's like they they just can't get over 75%. So then they feel like they need to show up in the What did Yeah. I was going to say cuz you Yeah. You built one that's on the back of So for us it's low ticket. I don't know this guy but found him in the hallway. It's uh ours is low ticket low ticket ops low ticket purchase then book a call that's like a quick start starter implementation whatever call and then on the thank you page of that is an app that you put on there that has free form questions and stuff. Yeah. So it's like an in it's positioned as like an intake form or an onboarding form and originally I made that form for a different offer and I I wanted to just get like market research data. So, I was like, "Hey, why did you buy it? Why did you almost not buy it? Why what were the bonuses that you were like most attractive to you?" And I was going to use that data as like market insights, which I did. But then I actually ran like a meta analysis on like all the buyers who filled that out. And they were about four times more likely to ascend into the backend or higher ticket products than people who did not fill out the form. And then I found an even higher correlation between first purchase order value. So like their initial AOV when they bought the low ticket and if they filled out the intake form they would have sent it like 11 point something percent versus like 3%. So can you do you think that's like it is there a way to make more people fill it out and it'll follow that or do you think it's just inherently like the people who do it do it like I don't know if it's causation or correlation but I think not having it is not a good idea. I've seen people do it even on I was wondering why it's there because people do on m like free webinars or even free challenges and I fill it out and nothing happens but it must be it must be doing something good or crushing. So um all right, what else we got on here? Uh what else on the tech side of things? We've got um we got someone else joining us here today. This is just raw. We're just shooting the show. Cool. Um, what else in software though? Anything else on that? Uh, I mean it's not really soft. I was say you're what are you using AI wise or something in in marketing media buying creative world? I love Claude right now for reviewing copy and making different voice styles. So you like you just take take like the VSSL or even like YouTube content or whatever, take the transcript and then make a style in Claude and then you just paste the raw text in like 30 minutes of somebody talking. It'll give you like an amazing voice and style and then if your copyriter wrote like a whole VSSL, which like we just did, then I can say, "Hey, like rewrite this whole thing in the voice and take it from like score it first and it'll say, "Oh, this is like a 70 out of 100." and I'll be like, "Cool, rewrite it so it's 100 out of 100 and bang on with this style and then you plug in the style, hit extended thinking and it'll just rip like a really badass VSSL or ad script or anything you want." Yeah, you were telling me about that the scoring one how you like scored the VSSLs. Yeah. Yeah. What is that based on though? Who's What did you feed the AI? So like who says it's a 10 or like 100? Shout out to Peter Kell. I do that all the time. I'm like, "Oh, we bought Peter Kell's course. We bought uh Jerry Aes and stuff." Like I buy I buy everything. Peter Kell's got like a a VSSL assistant like um prompt or whatever that he uses. But like even if you don't have a prompt, you can always say like, "Hey, based on the like if you're doing like a a web page." Actually, that's the thing I've been loving doing with CRO is screenshotting like the mobile above the fold of the funnel, giving it to Claude and then saying like, "Hey, act as if you're a conversion rate optimization expert with like 20 years experience or pretend that you're Chris Goward because that guy has like a sick book on CRO." and then like rate the conversion elements of the page out of 10 and then like give me suggestions on like how I can make this page way better and beat this as the control and then it'll give you all the suggestions and you just say hey can you mock this page up and then it'll literally like build a demo page like a wire design it'll design it right copy plug everything in you can like literally publish it as an artifact send the link to your funnel builder developers or whatever and they'll just have like a at least they can have a visual because usually You're giving like the funnel builder ideas like in writing, but if you can give them a visual. Yeah, that's interesting. And you don't have to like mess around in Figma for an hour. You can just do it. I'm going to I'm going to shut up about marketing after this, but something that everyone always asks me and I'm like this is not my expertise and like you two are going to know this. You're like all all of you were not going to know this as well, but like everyone always asks what is Yeah, same. Uh what is simply put like shortish answer on how you would like start a campaign or how you would basically do testing in the beginning like literal structure of the camp and like optimization on something for example let's just use the VSSL call funnel if you were running one from scratch how you would start it with testing like ad breakdown campaign and then once it's in scaling how you'd run that as if you'd run AVO you'd do CBO you break these loaded it it's not but like no no but seriously short It's a short answer. No, because there is there is a CBO. There is scaling CBO. But like No, honestly like because that's one that happens all the time and I'm like you can look at YouTube videos where people talk about this forever, but like I never say like in the trenches this is what's happening. Okay. Cuz I don't try your best. That's a long Okay, I'll see if I can go quick surf method. Yeah. Yeah. Just Yeah. Surf scale. Yeah. Surf. I forgot about that. That's like an OG, dude. 100k a day just dump dump a CV caps in like a thousand bucks maybe work. Come on. What is it? Okay, so like if you were to start whether it's like a low ticket funnel, callunnel, whatever, like from scratch. I personally have found the best results doing a [ __ ] campaign and it's like you're creative testing because like you don't want to just like throw all the [ __ ] at the wall. Plus, when you do graduate stuff to bigger scaling campaigns, Facebook actually just found this out on Monday talking to our Facebook rep that preheating ads is a thing in meta that they actually want you to validate spend on an ad before you move it to a scaling campaign. And if you ever graduate stuff like into your main campaigns that are already spending a lot, those ads usually won't earn anything if you like make them and they don't have spend behind them on the post ID. So anyways, it'd be like one campaign obviously, but it's on it's on [ __ ] So it's So it's [ __ ] and you just every single adset you have the same creative. So let's say you have five videos and two images or something. So you'd have seven adsets and every ad set is only that creative and it's the same creative in both ads. Uh, and then the only thing that's different is like the copy or the headline or just like a different variation of like the hook if you want or something like that on the creative side. And then every ad set has the same structure. So, it's like every ad set is two ads, but each ad is the same creative, just make a different copy variation of it. And like I've started those and you get like really good cost per call because the budget's lower. So you start the budget, by the way, really low because then you're forcing Facebook to just get you something for the spend. The the CPA is way lower. It's not sustainable, but then you'll at least find whatever ad creatives you can then use. So let's say out of those five videos and two images or whatever that you ran, one of the images pops and does really well and the CPA is really good and then like two of the videos are really good or three of the videos are really good. You take those post IDs and then you move it into a CBO at like a more ideal budget which is like whatever that calculation is. You try to reverse engineer your CPA so you can get 50 conversions in a week and on that campaign and that's why that's how you're choosing what you're optimizing for based on that. Yeah. Of the budget. Yeah. Yeah. Cody, is this making sense right now for your quiz? There's actually a challenge. It's rigged though, so you're never going to be put. Yeah. Yeah, it's rigged. Okay. And then you drop those in. To put simply, that's I mean, no, that makes sense though. Literally the amount of times that comments, DMs, whatever that people ask that and I'm like there are so many people like on YouTube that talk about this in so you like that I think fundamentally isolating variables. Isolate variables then you move them into the big campaign only when they're proven. Yeah. Boom. That would have been nice. Look at that. Boom. No, I know a dude who's literally doing that with a freaking low ticket. He's got no high ticket on the back end. Last I checked, 50k a day. I saw the seats and cash or uh that's just low ticket on the front end or whatever. No, that's a good one too. Nursing's also a good one too. 50k in like revenue cash. Yeah, cash day low ticket upfront profitable company. Um and he's doing he's I was like, "Bro, how do you run ads?" and he's like, "Oh, I just freaking throw in a CBO." And you just isolate a variable. Then you freaking throw in a scaling thing. He's like, "Yeah, I don't really know. I just make he's really good ads." All he thinks is, "How do I write really good ads?" He wakes up. It's kind of like Mr. Beast. He's like, "Make good videos." He's like, "Just make good VSSL ads. 10-minute VSSL ads. That's all he does." I'm like, "That's it." VST on platform. It is in health. So, you have to think about what's the market. It's health. It's not supplements. So, obviously, if I'm in like bisop or other things or relat, I probably wouldn't do that. But health specifically. and female market. I would do that for sure. Chill. Nobody running that market by the way. Uh if I was in All right. Doesn't work. We're bring Yeah, exactly. That market's terrible. They have no money. Um saturated. It's super. So bringing Cody back into this and then everyone What are we at by the way at minutes 22? Cool. What part of a current model you're running in your business or otherwise is not scalable? and what's your plan to change that? And that's just like the idea behind are you doing something on purpose that's not scalable or are you doing something on accident that you're just like we just have to do it? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. So I would say the the one thing that I'm doing right now that's not scalable is I'm going to more events and speaking and you know doing things like that to you know just kind of ramp up uh one of the businesses that I'm involved in um as I'm working on paid ads on the back end just to get you know more momentum going. So I don't see it as scalable because I the life that I'm designing doesn't involve me going to events very frequently. Uh, so it's not scalable because I choose to not want to do that. Um, so that that would be the biggest thing. And then what was the other part of the question? Well, then I guess that you already kind of answered it. The plan to replace that is you're doing paid ads in the background. Yeah. Doing paid ads in the background. And I think I think I mean for for anyone like in getting their offers up off the ground, I think, you know, organic and just like just brute force at the beginning really can just get momentum going. Um, but yeah, so I think that's that's the thing I'm doing right now that don't want to do longterm, but is a good short-term thing. Yeah. No, that's that's fair. You you said ours before this, but I think it's funny. What the what you think is not scalable that we're currently doing with the lift ticket? No, I actually I think that uh if I was to answer that, I would actually say that VSSLs are not as scalable as people think. And if they are, you're probably doing something borderline illegal or not FDC compliant. Um, I mean, just I've like said on this channel like, "Yeah, we've done 70 million through one VSSL." No, no, but like but but so like but but you did 70 million over a certain number of years for sure that I think it's like there's like a VSSL will have like a limited scale potential because you're always hammering the crap out of that top 3% of the buyer pyramid which will replenish. It doesn't just like go away. It's always being refed. until you Oh, that's fun. So, like you're saying if you like hammer it like if you hammer it like if the market is replenishing I got it. That's interesting. So, like you can ride it but like once you get to if you push it too hard too fast then you'll usually break it like really that's why you're like well we went to like 50k day and spinning the whole thing broke and we went back to 25 then all of a sudden it starts working again and it's because like it doesn't have to like force itself out of like the pool of the [ __ ] that's working and then like that's why the low ticket works so well. That's why organic cont devil's advocate. Sure. Do you think there's a message that could work on a larger pool? Yeah. I mean maybe. Yeah. Okay. But it has to be transition from unaware to that that's that was kind of Blake that was his answer before this about low ticket about where it is in the like awareness. It can only get to 150. Let me say it this way. just extensive being over being over reliant on one acquisition funnel style is it's very dangerous. You need to have the value. You have to have the [ __ ] You got to get the value vortex, boys. Okay, we got it now. Thank you. You have to have like another There's another There's another throw in. So, like generating leads is valuable. Like I used to be like hardcore DR and I thought that like branding and stuff like that or like engagement campaigns and content didn't matter as much. But like brand awareness campaigns are inherently valuable if you run them long enough. People don't run them long enough. Lead gen campaigns are valuable if you're running a callunnel because then those leads will end up finding their way to your conversion campaigns. Low ticket is valuable because it keeps feeding people into your buyer pyramid that will then buy from you later. I don't know man. That sounds pretty scalable. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now, now it's scalable. It's caps. What else? What's What are you doing that's not scalable? Um uh obviously Oh, right now our webinars when we were testing them live, you can't just keep doing them live. So now we're just moving them to automated. And so I guess our plan to replace it because one of the issues is time zone. So you pick a terrible time for your webinars, you're freaked. Like no one's going to show up. It's over. And so what we found working with other webinars, what we're going to start doing is when someone signs up, it'll just stream at 700 p.m. in their time zone, no matter where they are in the world. So it's always 7:00 p.m. at night. It's like the And if it's Thursday, pages auto change all the time. And then if they miss that, then you send them to an encore like classic, but then it's at 2 p.m. the next day. So the way we're going to replace it is we're going to start doing that. Um, and then maybe we'll put a low ticket in front of it. But I'm I'm lowkey so bullish on webinars and live events right now. I've heard like six people say I'm I'm a low ticket person that not even about how like I love low ticket. I told you we should do it. I know you the challenge idea. That's the workshop one. You should do a challenge. Yeah, challenge workshop. Low tickets are great. It's basically the same I'm pushing. I know, right? Well, that's what Yeah, cuz Sorry, I didn't mean to cut off, but yeah, but you can like you can live I know somebody running with one person on a team though. It's one guru, one guy, and you live simulate it on Zoom after you do it once. Russell Brunson is selling online one. I Why is everyone saying that it takes like seven people 24 hours a day for like live like a guest, but when you live simulating Zoom? You're doing it high production style. It's like everyone on all the time for days. It takes a lot. But do you need to do live? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. We've never run one. No, but even like your first one, just having a basic ass page where you they and ideally it's paid because like if it's free, the show rates sometimes like as low, right? He's like, I will not I will no longer run free. Unless you but it comes No. Yes and no. Yes. So the biggest offers are free webinars out there. It comes down to economics. If you have if you're going at volume play, cost per lead is going to be lower for challenge sign up. You're going to have a VIP option. Y if you can get people to purchase the VIP through emails, obviously Otto page and you do that post option on the front. You have two options on the front. No, it's no opt but then heavily pushed in the group with bonuses and so it just comes down to economics at the end of the day because we've ran a ton of challenges over the past year that that have done you know I'll I won't say it millions 10 millions billions couple hundredk per challenge for sure um and whether it's free or paid the the it just it comes down to the economics of like are you going to get a cheap enough lead on the front and to hit the volume target that you need to hit the cash target that you need on the back end. Yeah. Cuz the paid acquisition of a of a buyer lead, sure, it's going to show better. It's going to close better, but typically you're going to have less volume. You played the volume thing forever. Maybe you do. We've played the volume. How do you guys make volume work if you're not sending emails like crazy? Like because I've heard that I've heard like all these people say that they do it's it's a volume game. It's volume game. on the thank you. Well, I mean, seriously, we have a we have a we have a copywriter that does two emails a day every single day as blasts in addition to the automations they'll get that are like specific and contextual for whatever they did, right? And like that's volume and we have insane amounts of content that then goes on site that if they want to make their way to there and like or and all the stuff consume, but like these other guys are like we do volume. They don't have any of that or very limited to that to IC and they still get it to work. It's like we have to have those touch points. But but are you forcing them into like a a challenge event or like a workshop event or is it long-term evergreen? It's kind of like that's what it's just like a long it's a different Yeah, it's different model. When we just sign up for a free event, I put them in like a a WhatsApp group or you put them on so we can just it's forced attention, right? Like like a lot of the uh like lead magnet funnels and trip wires and stuff, I'll see like a 60 60 to 67 day ascension to a book call on those. Wow. which is rough, but the the cost per lead is so cheap. And so again, like it comes back to what you were saying, which is like if your VSSL is capped on a direct market of 3%, you need top ofunnel leads, can you afford within the overall budget that you're pushing per month to have like a certain percent that's that is just lead magnet leads that are coming in within a certain period of time or going to the center of a call. That would be crazy. I can't imagine how long that would be for us. I think almost everything is scalable. Well, yeah. I mean, you could put a machine. It's like I was thinking like events or this or that. Like that would suck, but like people No, I think I think like people look at like like a finite thing and then they're like, "Oh, this isn't scalable." But then there's all like everyone's making everything work and then there's always just a ton of [ __ ] around whatever the single thing is. But some of those brands also have like a two out of five Trust Pilot rating. So, but they're also scaled. But they're also scaled. doing things can't scale. You have to choose what what what you're willing to pay for like what what the cost is because well no I would say there's also examples of people doing pretty much the same thing with with good trust pilots. True. Yeah. So it's I think it's zooming out more and then thinking of the value vortex and how everything's inter in interangled. But like even those even people that are running like for example VSSL's at like a heavy clip, they don't just have one. Correct. They have multiple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like that's that's still VSSLs. So it's like VSSL. I didn't say that I didn't say that VSSL's everything is scalable. I did not say that VSSLs are not scalable. I said being over reliant on one VSSL or one acquisition. It's always more than just one thing. I was hold on. I have some non-scalable things. I have two non-scalable things. this conversation. Ads that don't have ROI. This is the most non-scalable conversation will not have ever cut. Ads that don't have ROI can't scale that. True. This is why he's legit. This is why he has death and tax uh you can't scale a dirty pixel. If you have [ __ ] up pixel data and you scale into that, that's going to [ __ ] you up. That's fair. That's fair. What do we got next? What do we got next? on some like fun or more fun questions. All right, we can do quick ones. Quick ones. Yeah, quick ones. These aren't fun. These are just quick stories. What is the boldest move you're seriously? Yeah, right. Yeah, tell us your scariest story. What is the boldest move you're seriously considering in 12 months? Within the next 12 months? Like the biggest biggest like out of like what is something crazy you're trying to accomplish in the next 12 months? It can be personal or professional. I we're trying to [ __ ] get to like 8 to 10 million a month and I'm putting my absolute [ __ ] dick on the table and if it doesn't work, you know, it's like that's very stressful because the thing's way bigger and you got big payroll. You said you said we're scaling to 8 to 10 million a month. Oh yeah, we're just going off. We have like a more than a like we have a million dollar a month payroll and Yeah. You need to tell us like you got it's harder to roll up the bigger it gets. It's harder to keep leaning in the more team. What do you tell yourself when you're facing okay you want to do that next? What do you tell yourself every day as you keep going? There's got to be a conversation in your head that gets you that big I have a fundamental belief that I can do it because somebody else is doing it. Yeah. And uh that's the main thing. And then number two is that's just my appetite. I wouldn't be satisfied with something standing still. I like to continue to evolve and grow and expand. With your appetite, what does that get you? Figure out what I can do. Figure out why. I mean, I know the general trajectory of where I want to go in business and it's big. So, got to do it. Yeah. Well, Luke just said they're on the because somebody else has done it. I've said that like 50 times on here. I'm like, if I I am not the most creative person in the world. I'm not the zero to one person, but like if there's literally a framework, I talk about buying the courses or whatever, but if like I see somebody that's literally running this exact model to pick a different market and whatever, but like they're running the model and they're doing 10 million a month and it's like dumb down. It's like they're running a direct toart offer that then has a setter team that goes to closers. The price ranges are around this and it's like now it's volume and like that is the extreme dumb down version, but like the model can push to 10 million to 15 million a month. And then like what they're talking about the event and I talked about this in the video here yesterday was like and then you add these things for low ticket ascension once you get to these rates and you add recurring on the back end for at these rates and then this push like if someone's doing it at that scale at 150 200 plus there's people in fitness space doing 300 million just like loads with that whole machine but you all you see is this and it's like okay like someone can do it so why couldn't we but going beyond that is extremely difficult for my brain being like what is the unknown I talked to Adam on here and he was like I told I basically said that yeah we're trying to push this thing into like people do it at 10 million so we can do it and he was like what would you have to do to get 50 million a month and I was like I don't know and it's like the I think it's Cardone or uh Dan Sullivan's one or I think it's one of those two but they talk about it's like the 10x thing it's like if you're doing your annual planning it's like how are we going to grow 30% or 50% this year you have like 40 things you could do 2x is better than 10x yeah that's one easier yeah 10x is easier than 2x and he's like okay if you're going to What if you're going to do now instead of growing double or whatever 50%. You're going to grow 10 times. It's like what can you do? And you're just like scratch scratch scratch scratch and there's like two here or maybe none of them. And there's one thing two things that you can do fundamentally shift to get to that. And it's like that's re that's about as far as my brain can go on that kind of stuff before it's like I'm going to create Apple or you know what I mean? Like I can't I don't go there in my in my forecasting abilities. I feel like the bullest thing that I have to do is step out of operating like I think I found out where I best role in my business like business and let go. What are you hiring for? He's hiring for like I'm just gonna I mean Craig Craig and I'm probably gonna bring stuff partner with Craig. People like Craig who have things you can operate and scale because I try to like fit into doing it and it'll just like burn and so I have to let go of okay hand it off and then just do a bunch of that because I can get the deals and get the connections but it's scary to like let go of that because you start so young you control everything. The idea letting it even if you start old you control everything though. That's a limited belief. Josh Yeah, Josh answering the scale question. And it's it's him right now. Yeah. I can't scale. It's like there's all these I I have all these offer ideas. It's like realistically I can't do it by myself. So yeah. So what stops you from building a team then? Me? Um I'm not a manager. I'm an entrepreneur. So it's I can't manage. I sure I can build a manager, but why not just find someone who already is or can operate or who can do that? I want Ryan's in my team, you know? Like I want the Blakes. I'm you know I want to be this dude. You I can get this dude like where you get to five wherever. But it's like game pasta. you had to get a Ryan, you had to get a freaking Blake. So now it's Neil's people. That's why all my friends are operators. I only surround myself with operators, not entrepreneurs because I need to see like what makes a good operator, who's good, feel it out, develop that relationship and then I can and then also operators, they share stuff and as entrepreneur helps me see further and then I just can cast that vision to myself or to operators and so it's real. That's the next step. I would challenge the limiting belief though. Do it. Yeah. Do it. Yeah. But just the like one of the things that I've learned is like as a leader like your job isn't even to know how to do the thing. Your job is to design what the vision is and what the outcome looks like what does success look like? Like you can manage, you can learn to manage, but like you can manage people to outcomes. Like the way that I teach my team to lead, which I say lead versus manage, is to lead on outcomes, not on tasks. And if you hire monkeys, then they're not going to be able to figure out how to get the outcome. So it's like finding people that have in their past experiences achieved outcomes that you're looking to achieve in your company. And then literally like I do this for like departments that I don't understand. like technology I don't understand it but like I write a document for what does success look like to me in my terms from like technology it means the websites just work all the time it means like our our things connect like I don't know all the technical language but like I can break it down in layman's terms and like I give that to my senior webdev and it's like I'm like this is what success looks like whatever things you do on the back end I don't really care but this is the outcome that I'm looking for and I do the same thing with my CFO. I don't know how to do this crazy financial forecasting, but like I give, you know, it's like giving people outcomes and if they're talented, they can go get those outcomes. If they're monkeys, they're not going to get the outcomes regardless. So, it's like it doesn't framing as leading over managing does free up that like like managing managing is like you're micromanaging the tasks they do. And if you hire people that don't know what they're doing, you have to micromanage them and then you can't scale because you're just chasing them down for what tasks they're doing versus leading them based on the outcome that they should be achieving for your business. And with your what your model is copy this what yeah when what with your model there is plenty of comp and room on the table for someone like that to be like extremely motivated for quite a true a smaller portion of the pie because you have so many offers because you have so many pieces like just doing the comp plus getting the right person like bro I have studs that that are like six fig just at low six figures that work in my companies studs like talented talented talented people like you don't have to give away the farm. Not saying like partnerships are bad like you find good partnerships like just challenging more so the the thought of like because that's I feel like the man Yeah. And that's why I think financial models are so important. What I'm realizing is because financial model shows outcome like even say I hit up our media buyer and I was like here's our best case. It was like Josh Troy's like best case, base case, worst case, whatever. I sent him the sheet. I'm like, "All right, stay within this." Like, "Can what do we need to do?" Worst case is like 40% of both. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "No, these are the KPIs." And so, yeah, that's I like that lead instead of manage cuz I can lead the outcome. You can lead the outcomes. You cast your vision. The way you attract those people is you cast the vision of what you're building. And then if you cast the vision and they want to come work for you, then you like just show them what success means to you. And if they and then you lead them to that. And if they're not doing it, then it's like, okay, you're not the right fit. All right, guys. We're 40 in. We good? Anyone have any final closing fun? I don't know what he was talking about for like 10 minutes. Guess what? Yeah. 90% of the people that somehow ended up on these is that short answer. It is. So, all right. Cool. Tomorrow, I'll do the month review. Sorry for the mobile terrible audio and things.
