# Funnels, Closers, Crypto, and Pricing (49min Q&A) | EP73
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6WU754_0w

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be having some fun and going through our weekly weekend Q&A round five. All these questions were submitted to the request box over the last week. And today, we're going to deep dive answer all of them. I have briefly reviewed these and it looks like we have everything from some beginner what would you do from zero questions to some deep context where people are stuck with things like offers, pricing, and scale. We even have some guys in here that are doing 5600K a month in cash collected. So, today is going to be very tactical and very useful for you. Last year we did 30 million cash collected and we have now crossed over 74 million actually in total cash collected in our info coaching business. And I don't want your money. I'm not selling anything. No guru, no course, nothing. All I'm doing is sharing what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to over $und00 million a year in our business. And I do this because I want to find talent. I want to find opportunities. And I want to build a network of cool people doing cool All right, simple as that. So, let's get into it. I have enough caffeine and nicotine to run for a long time. time. So, we'll see. All right. First one. I think you kind of already covered the tech stack, but for a business that's doing around 30K per month, what was the ideal tech stack should be? I've been bouncing between a few email providers and I'm switching to GHL soon, but I've been having a hard time sticking with a specific stack of softwares. What was your guys tech stack in the beginning stages or what would you recommend where to start? Okay, so for us, this is going to depend on what business model or what funnel types you are running, but for us, we initially started as a direct to cart. So, we were using ClickFunnels. um, Stripe for the processing, but Clickfunnels for all the funnels, pages, everything like that. And then in the beginning, we were actually using infusionoft and then moved over to Active Campaign for CRM. Um, and then we actually moved over to Shopify for a minute and used Clavio on the back end and that, but where we ended up landing on uh, it's kind of a big stack because we're on a callunnel. So, you're going to need your forms. So, we use Jot Form, Kally for your booking widget, we use HubSpot for our CRM, we use ClickFunnels for our order forms and sales pages. You could use it for your whole website, but we use Web Flow for the whole website. So, that's just like the core basic stack. Um, but what you would need, I mean, GHL is going to have everything you need. I've only worked in GHL a little bit. Um, I think they have a great thing going, but I really like dedicated tools that are really good for what they do, not all-in-one tools, personally. Um, but GHL will be able to do everything you need. Uh, for 30K a month, million. I mean, you can go real high on GHL as long as you use some of the integrations and some of the custom stuff. Um, or not custom, but a little more advanced stuff. So yeah, GHL will be able to do everything you need and I think it's like 300 bucks a month or something like that and it's it's everything. So I would just do that if you just want something simple out of the box. But then yeah, depending on your funnel, you need to understand which tech tools you need. I love HubSpot. I think it's expensive even in the beginner. I know ours is expensive, but we have you know millions of contacts and you know hundred users and seats. So I know it's expensive for us and I'm not ex exactly sure but I think it's a great platform. You can really scale into it. A lot of other guys use close.io or close.com. I think they bought now. And that one's really good for sales team specific. But for us, HubSpot can do all the marketing, sales, and a lot of those other pieces. Um, next one. I am 18, averaging 10 to 15K per month. Nice. I was not doing that at 18. And now building my new agency in cash flow. Will improve soon. Okay. Well, it's already doing all right. But how do you manage cash flow? I find it super hard to actually spend money, and I have somewhat of a scarcity mindset. Lots of people talk about abundance and waste a bunch of cash to make it back. Is it really worth it? How do I manage cash flow? So, uh, the technical answer of this is we have sheets and reporting and stuff that actually manages cash flow. And I don't think that's what you're asking me, but, uh, all money in, all money out, bucketed, what percent is in what, right? Like your P&L kind of classic, but for us, we have real-time day overday cash flow, so we can see what's actually happening. Um, when you're talking about not, it's hard to spend money. I think what you're saying is building the business and like spending more money on team to grow the business and at some level yes that is like a scarcity mindset for sure but also you know 18 lean and mean running this there are ways with a lot of automations VAS light team that you can get a lot higher than this with like very lean team so uh I think that's what you're asking me um is it really worth it to scale into yes there is the issue which is something you don't even really need to think about right now but you can get too big but I I guess you could think of it because think about if you hired three buddies for 5k a month right now like you would have no more right you'd have no more profit you'd have no more cash flow um so that's like the simple example but for us like when we were scaling we were going from 1 to 3 million a month and we started hiring like in advance for all these positions not necessarily where it hurt but where we thought we were going to need it and it burned a lot of cash that was unnecessary. So between mismanagement of people, between efficiency, between just overall headcount, uh that was an issue. And then same thing with some we didn't go too hard with some of the tech tools, but we definitely leaned into ads really really heavy. So for us, just as an example, you know, if we're making 10 15k in profit, we're like, "Oh, we need to spend that back into ads like instantly because we were banking on future money and future all this stuff for like a longer LTV, not like initial cash only." And that has burned us or more so burned profit that didn't need to be. So, I would think of it like that. And then in terms of like I think I'm trying to understand this question, but I have some somewhat of a scarcity mindset and abundance, waste cash to make it back. Yeah, you're going to have to reinvest whether it's time that you're investing or whether it's money. And it's kind of a trade-off usually between those two. But yeah, I think that I think that's what you're asking me. If you're starting from zero today, what would you do based on your current knowledge? So, based on my current knowledge uh is really in this space and kind of online business overall, but not really. I mean my direct experience is in with is within the info coaching world. Um so I would likely do something like that. I would find an expert and uh I would go Josh Gavin mode and I would build something around an expert. I would own with my current understanding and knowledge I could get 70 80 90% of the company to build and then have them as the expert whether if it was if I was starting from zero and I had no cash I would have to give them a percent because I wouldn't be able to pay them. Now I would like to I would just pay them uh I wouldn't even give them that uh a percent of it likely. I would just, you know, use their IP, brand them, and then build a business around them. So, that's generally what I would do. I would pick a niche that is, I know, is luxury, high, you know, high ticket space style that has really good results. I would pick something that very likely is outside of the whole like make money online space. Um, there are some pockets within there that I think do great, but I would start there. Um, because I would pick an expert that could dominate niche. Think high ticket, think life insurance, think financial planning, think um, you know, B2B style things where you can have a 25K plus ticket because then you can really just lean into ads and you have a lot more room for error and as long as the results are there, there's even bigger LTVs on the back end. So, I would do that. Um, and I would just run the whole business and never be in a single ad or on the face. Getting started. I don't know what that means. Um, Facebook ad testing and campaign structures. I just asked my CMO about this. We're probably going to pop on and do one of these. But he, if you go back to the videos on the channel, we do like a round table where we're all just sitting there like a bunch of dumb asses in black t-shirts because we were at an event and for some reason that's a thing on accident. But, uh, he talks about this where he basically says, you know, Facebook just came out with you should test ads before you drop them into CBOS. So he goes into how the different optimizations he chooses in the beginning based on how many conversions you can get, how you should test these ads in ABOS's to basically warm them up and then move those post IDs into CBOS's is his like general structure. Um there's, you know, 92 more nuances and things I'm sure, but that is simply that and then I'll have him on and we'll do some one to one on like what's working now for our funnels and our and our paid side. So I apologize in advance for the length of this question. You're good, but I'd like to give you as much context as possible. I think these are very helpful and the context is very helpful. So just for everyone into the future and if you want to submit these I do these every week. So up here um I have no one in my life who understands online space like you do. So it would mean a lot if you give me feedback. Got you. I've recently put all my focus into growing sports pages on TikTok and gained over 33,000 followers in the past 30 days, bringing my total follower count to about 70. I assume that means other places. I plan to start monetizing these pages through selling sports picks and affiliate deals with sports books. Once I've mastered this monetization strategy, I want to start selling info in the form of mentorship to help other sports fans start, grow, and monetize their own sports pages. Okay. Problem for me is I've always excelled academically and have very strong desire to be successful. I recently got a full ride to law school. Let's go. And feel immense pressure from my family to go down the traditional path, which would be much more guaranteed, but I don't want to work the 9 to5. I want to do well in law school, but I also dream life involves making money online, getting the freedom. Freedom is the big one there, uh, in my opinion. Do you think the sports page monetization into info strategy is a viable plan with potential and something I would do on the side while studying in law school until I make enough to justify following this career I'm on? All right, so that's like uh that's a loaded one. So, first of all, congrats. This is fantastic. A lot of people don't get this. Um up here, first of all, building out this and then going into info to sell it. Two very different things. I would almost recommend don't go into info. Why create competition for yourself in the space if you can dominate this? I know a couple guys local actually that I don't really know really well, but I hear they absolutely crush this where they build these like branded pages on Instagram and Tik Tok and like these huge things and then go off and you know people buy these things for tens of millions of dollars once they're built up. Like think of I'm not a big sports guy so excuse my ignorance on this, but there's like gaming ones. I know there are just like general meme pages and there's like niche specific ones around sports or whatever. And you build these pages that have this audience and then you can sell those. You can either, you know, sell ad space, you can set, there's so many different ways to monetize once you have this built up of an audience. Um, so I would just lean into this. So I would network with other guys that are doing this. I'm sure there's Telegram groups. I'm sure there's chats. I'm sure on X people are doing this where they build these massive branded pages and then either sell them or then monetize them aggressively. Um, and there's a lot of ways to do that, especially in this niche to my understanding. Um, so selling sports picks, whether you partner with someone to do that and get a crazy good affiliate deal or just have an affiliate deal direct, I think that's a great way. this part right here where it's like I want to info and mentor people to do it. I wouldn't do that. That is that it's more of a short-sighted cash thing. Like if you can come up with some big backend where like you get I I don't even know if I do this because the the real play on this is what's the back end of this business, not what's the 10 grand or 50 grand or 200 grand you make a month teaching people how because you're instantly creating competition for yourself. Unless there's some way like I know a guy who does this with lead genen and when he teaches people how to do lead genen he's technically creating competition for himself but like one the market is so big and two once they get in there they either a lot of them become media buyers for him over time because they're like oh I just rather get funded to do it or they join all these affiliate networks or lead genen networks and stuff and he gets a percentage of everything they make like very very small but like it's really more the networking play and then them joining his team. So I don't know that you should do info though. What should you do with your life? Um, I don't know how much time you have in a day or how much time you want to dedicate to this, but I don't see why you couldn't do I know law school is very intensive. My sister did law school. She did full ride too actually. Shout out. Um, but she was in the trenches and she was very very it was very busy for her. So, if you can navigate them both, I mean, I would lean into this and just keep building this and beat the drum. Beat the drum. Get around people and grow that. I would still do this, especially if it's like a family thing and this is like a great achievement, especially if you want to do it over time. There's ways to make massive amounts of money in business and life with law. Um, but if that's not something you want to do and that's something that would be okay with you and your family, I I'm not maybe not the person to answer this for you and your specific. Um, but yeah, I mean, lean into the sports page, decide if you want to do this or if it's okay with family and like I don't know if you can take a break or not, but like I would do that. I don't know how much I don't know what your goal is in life, but if your goal in is is freedom, I know that the traditional route of this is not really that freeing. Over time it can be, but this definitely can be. So hopefully that's helpful. Hey Ryan, appreciate all the value. Drop. Quick question from two entrepreneurs. Double question. All right. Or building a fitness coaching business. Where'd you get that idea? Uh targeting a specific niche. Religious women. Okay. Age 20 to 40 and focus on weight loss through fitness, nutrition, and mindset with a longevity focus. All right. We are considering one thing. Actually, I'm going to read this first and then I'll answer. Uh we're going to consider two 12week models. So 12 weeks is what? Three months. So, weekly one-on-one calls for 850 or small group one to four coaching for 500 a person, 2K per group. Total and lead sourcing is organic. You're doing content to an intake form to a sales call. This is what we do as well except we do uh paid. We might test a group webinar to offer or low ticket upsell flow later. My goal is 50K a month with the solid delivery and strong results and accessible price point. And from your operator lens, are these models viable with weekly coaching at these price points while hiring other coaches? Any early flags we should watch out for? Um, all right. So, first things first, this niche. I love a good niche. I'm a big fan. But I don't necessarily know that I understand why specifically or like what you're layering in that makes it for religious other than in your marketing because a big thing that when you do a niche is that it's throughout the entire there there's continuity across the entire company I guess and across from like the front to the back. So yes, you can use it in your ads but you also use it in your fulfillment. You also use it it's in your community. It's in everywhere. So I don't know if that's the goal or if your plan is in alignment there. Um, so I would make sure that first. Um, because once someone gets in and it's like, "Oh, it's for religious women." And they come in and yes, there's other ones around there because it's only when you sell, but like is it is it focused on that? Is there part of that in here? Maybe in the mindset portion. Uh, this model one-on-one calls versus group coaching, the pricing different. So, first of all, that's very cheap. 850. So, we'll just call that a,000 because my brain's not working right now and it's early. But a,000 bucks for that's four grand a year. Yeah, because it's three months. So, it's four grand a year or it's less than four grand a year. So, that's that's definitely cheap uh for one to one, but if you're just getting started, I mean, I get it to start and just try and get like get some get some momentum, get some client results, get people in the door. I mean, you could even do it for less if that's your goal. If you don't have any, you know, direct case studies or results and things around this, the onetoone versus group. So, what you're selling them is the result. Uh I mean, kind of the process, but what you're mainly selling them is the result. So for you, the big difference with group versus one-on-one is your cost structure because you're going to pay a coach relatively, let's call it the same, what you're going to pay them for option two or option one. So understanding the difference in what your margin is and if they can still get the same result with one to four versus one one, you might as well be doing one to four for all of them because it's going to be cheaper for you to do and you could likely charge the exact same price. So I think what I think the thinking on it is maybe a little wrong where like you need to understand the cost and I and I see what you're trying to do with small group versus onetoone but like they could both be the same cost and as long as you get the result for the client it's what they're paying for um at some level to deliver. Yes. But so I like your idea of organic too. I mean that is you're going to save 30 40 points on the bottom if you can get the lead flow but you need consistency around that. And if you don't have consistency around that, you likely need to go to paid or referral or partnership or whatever other 92 different traffic sources. But yeah, I mean I think so the goal is 50k a month, which is what a thousand no 100 people at your group coaching rate. Yeah, 100 people at your group coaching rate. I don't know. I can't do that math right now. I'm terrible at the zeros. Um but yeah, I mean that's totally feasible. 50k a month is not that not that crazy, especially for fitness. Um, so yeah, are the models viable? Weekly coaching, yes. While hiring other coaches, yes. Any other early red flags we should watch out for? Everything I said, plus probably 92 other things. But you can just start. You can just get people results and just begin. And then once you kind of like feel through this, and then just keep dropping questions in here with where you're at with it. But you need consistency around acquisition because churn is a real thing in fitness. What they get the if they get the results, if they don't get the result, they still churn. Um, so I would still I would focus you need some sort of consistent acquisition. It's a sales and marketing game. Um, as much obviously as fulfillment, but and then flywheeling with the results. And then again, I would really make sure that this niche that you're targeting is great, but like does it does it go through the whole company? Uh, not just in your marketing assets. Hopefully that was helpful. Next, if you had some if you had to start from scratch today, what would be your top three niches you go and do in the info space? Would it be fitness, something with strong backend, or something else? So, that's what I kind of answered up here for this, but I would go with something definitely with a strong backend. So, if I was to like literally go if I was today to be like, "Okay, cool. I'm going to stop working on this and go work on another one or like directly, it would be definitely in the higher ticket thing, it would be in something that has a massive backend. Massive massive." Um, I know guys that are in I don't want to like docks because they they're great, but they have a back-end play that is that could be millions of dollars like per person that comes in and pays them like five grand. And it's not everyone, but it's a portion of them. So like the blended number it's still it's crazy. It's like a thousand to one LTV uh to CAC and I mean they don't even have a CAC because it's organic. So I mean they do with content but so yeah I would go with something with a massive backend that is so again I use the example like insurance. I use the example like financial management pieces. is I know guys who crush it in that because they can still charge like 10 20 grand on the front for the the education, the info, the community, but then on the back when people go through partner like think of a Dave Ramsey for example like he has such a large partner network and such a large backend that he can it's just amazing. So I would go into that model. Um ours fitness has some but not not that crazy. I mean it's it's more of a it's more of a recurring play. There are some partnership plays depending on your niche. There are some other ways to monetize the back other than just stuff that you fulfill on um for sure. But yeah, I would definitely do that. I don't know other direct like top three specific niches necessarily off the top, but it would definitely be something with a strong back end. Struggling right now with show rates. How do you keep them above 50%. I have an entire video on the channel that's like how we got our se our show rates to 70 something%. Um our blended blended blended everything right now is like 5560. Um, but that includes cancels, that includes no shows, that includes reschedules. That's like literally every booking to every show. Um, the ones that come through setters. So, the the quick needle movers are make sure that the framing on the way in is correct. So, ask them before in the application on the booking like, you know, you're going to show up for this. You know, this is a call. If you do not show up for this, we will not talk to you ever again. Like some stuff around that. Then on the thank you page, it's going to be, you know, pop into your email. Make sure you confirm this thing. Watch the three-minute video that's framing about it. Have some like homework or something they need to do prior to the call. Have pre-objection blocks, which how much does this cost? Uh or, you know, is this expensive? The oh, what if this doesn't work for me or or how do I know what what even is this? Like anything that you have seen in your sales calls that come up as objections, try to get ahead of them and do pre-objection blocks. and then also have just a wall of testimonials that they consume prior to the call. We also are going to call them within the first five minutes of them booking. So, you're going to have an STR or a closer, whatever that reaches out to them either via text or phone to confirm the booking. If they do not confirm sometimes, and there are people, we've danced with this, but like you take them off the calendar completely. So, you just unconfirm them so someone else can book in their slot. Um, and then we also are going to do the reminders and I there's like 12 reminders and emails that come texts that come from different sources. They're all in the video that I posted. Um, and then the last one, what was the last one? Oh, the ad strategy. So, Jeremy Haynes, great great YouTube videos. He has an agency. I'm pretty sure it's an agency and like a mastermind, but he teaches the hammer them strat. So, you essentially are ramming ads at them uh up until like once they book before they get on a call. So, you have all these different ads that are queued up that show. So, you're basically just owning their feed uh with pre-objection block, with authority, with long form testimonials, all those stuff. So that's what we do. We do 5 to 600K a month in cash collected. Nice. And my sales team is built. My marketing team exists. My CS team exists. My admin ops team. Let's go. My main role as the founder at this time is simply controlling. I don't know what you're controlling. Checking sheets daily. And I still own the CMO role. So scripting and recording a bunch of ads every week and occasionally tweaking the funnel. So I assume you are the face or something similar. Uh, unless there are a bigger product uh product dev projects, my week is usually boring with little work hours, so I don't have much stuff to do. Is that normal? How much actual work are you doing at your level? Doing 15 to 30 million per year. Should it be a target to basically only sit in your office, look at a few sheets, occasionally improving the product with CS team, and run a few one-on-one meetings with team leaders every week sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I do something wrong because everyone seems to hustle 247. All right, first of all, I'm going to drink some coffee before this because this is a good one. So the everyone hustle 247 the me saying I'm working 16 hours a day in this season right now completely unnecessary. I I don't subscribe to it. I actually that's not true. I don't want to say it's unnecessary but I don't the hustle culture I agree there's a level of toxicity to it that is just unnecessary. Uh that portion. So I don't necessarily know what you mean when you say controlling things but like I get what you're saying where you're just like checking sheets and you're sitting in there. So there was an era in this where it was doing 2 three million a month and I was on four hours of meetings a week. Now we have other founders we have other sea level at that time and for a long time I was not necessarily in as much of an operational or handsin mode uh that I am now. what I'm doing now is much more groundwork and foundational work and you know for x amount of weeks has been ramping seale roles and has been like giving context and supporting with data and rebuilding systems and doing all these things around there that are call it like oneoff builds. So it's a one-off 16- hour day. It's not a oh now I have 16 hours of things to do every single day. When I also say that I've been doing this I've been doing YouTube stuff. I've been doing like I've been scattered all over the board and I'm not the best at time blocking and it looks like you are better at me than that which is 100% very easy probably to do to be better at me than this. So how much work am I actually still doing right now? It is positioning and making it so that we have the sea level and the management piece that what you're talking here they have where is it my main role so the CS team exists the admin ops the marketing team exists the sales team. So it's making sure for me that the next layers of this are scalable. so that they have the data they need, they have the automations, they have the system, they have all those things around them, they have the project management list that we operate out of. So right now it's like a big building of that because we want to make sure that we can scale with ease to the next one. So we're kind of like forecasting what the next issues are going to be and where things are, you know, where we need to hire where it hurts, where we need to change structure where it hurts, where things are messy in data or scale, automations that are going to break at scale. So it's really like a bunch of proactive work, but really I could work three or four hours a week right now and like everything would just run. It's just what I'm try I'm trying to work into the future of things. So this is great. I mean I don't it all depends on what your goal is. But if your goal is to sit in your office, look at a few sheets and improve the product like it just depends on how big you want to go because there are ways that right now you could be spending many hours a day building out entire back-end systems or ways to do this. You could be needlem mover on you could be needle mover on basically anything you choose. And for us, we just like to kind of like deep dive. We like to work and we probably overwork or overhustle and like kind of fake work sometimes for sure. I'll be the first to say it. Um but there are ways to develop and grow. If you want to double or triple that that you will be in proactive, you will be inside certain divisions and departments because if you want to double that could just be all LTV, so all backend. So you could just be with uh admin ops and CS for example and just hard pressing on what can you build? What is an entirely new product offering you can have to double on the back end. So you could be completely in there like you said your dev product dev projects. You could be on the front end try to get CAC cut in half. So how would you redo that completely? What are completely new funnel builds and structures? And again this is all unnecessary depending on your goal. If your goal is to just exist and do 5,600K a month and I don't know your margins, but like if that's great, like run it, you know, hire someone even to look at the sheets for you. I mean, at some level, um, not actually, but like, you know, you can have that. And then the question is, this is a big one that Dan Martell always talks about, which is like, buy back your time. Horoszi talks about it. It's amazing when you get to a place where you now have all this free time and you've gotten yourself out of it. I have done it. I have used it for the wrong things then, too. And that is what the big thing they say there is like if you're if you're making 200 bucks an hour now it makes sense on paper to hire somebody to do things that are $20 an hour roles like do your laundry and like make meals and do stuff like that. But the question is once you replace yourself from that now you're paying for those things. What are you doing with your now free time? And you have to do something that's more that's higher leverage and that continues to grow if that's your goal. There are a lot of people in this that'll just now travel and just do their thing. There are other people in this who go, "Okay, cool. Now that I have all this bandwidth, I can do even higher leverage things. I could have three of these companies. I could I could take this one to 5 million a month." And that's how we looked at it is the focus to do different things would be more difficult and probably hurt them all overall versus just scale ours aggressively high. We also have multiple partners. So, I don't know if you're a solo owner, but you know, the cash flow for someone who has partners in the business, multiple co-founders, um, you know, everyone makes their piece. So, the numbers have to be bigger for everyone to make the same kind of money you do. So, it sounds like you're in a great position and like congrats on what you've built. Um, another big one is we actually ran into this exact same issue where one of the co-founders was still the CMO and acquisition broke and it broke the entire company. Um, I'm not blaming at all. I'm just saying like because the CMO was not a person that was directly inside the org chart that was accountable to roles that was at the same layer of these kind of like other pieces where they bounce back and forth with sales and CS and you know were held accountable to standards. Uh it was internal to us as like the owners or leaders. Uh it failed and the rest of the company suffered massively and profit margins went to you know damn near zero on certain months and like it was not good. So, a full replacement would be this portion. Yeah. So, hopefully that makes sense. I would love if Yeah, just DM me and we can talk about this. Um, I think this is a good one. What is your process for grading calls to make sure every sales rep is staying compliant following scripts. Uh, for a long time it was just manual reviews um because we didn't have that many calls. Now we have whatever hundreds a day. So, we use AI tools. So, we use Zoom revenue accelerator on the back end. It has automated or we have created questionnaires or like checklists that review the calls with AI and then say if they did something or didn't and then also gives context to them on why it ranked it like that. So like is it in the beginning it's like one of the questions will be like did the uh did our sales rep set the uh intention or the agenda for the call and then it'll say yes or no but then under it'll say why it ranked it yes or no. So, it'll be like, "No, they started talking about cats within the first minute and then talked about them for 10 minutes and then it just kind of like made its way to the sales call and it's like it'll tell you why." So, that's one, but I know a lot of people actually just have spreadsheets that'll just go here and then it'll be like, "Did they do this, do they do this, do they do this?" And they have VA go through it or they just drop the transcripts in and feed into AI now is like the easier way. So, hopefully that's helpful. Um, and then the ones that get closed get like a super magnifying glass on them. The closed and loss because we do call reviews with sales management. we do call review. Like there's a lot of that. So there's eyes on these calls all the time. And now that we have setters and closers, they like dual review because a setter only gets paid when a closer closes. So it's like this game where there's a lot of accountability across each other. Hey Ryan, thanks for sharing so much valuable content. Quick context. I'm 21 and I've been running an info agency for uh two years. Generated a little over four million for clients. Nice. And your biggest bottleneck right now is sales. So my clients struggle to close. Okay. So it's sales inside your client businesses. Agency life. Uh, the real problem is I can't find any solid closers. I live in a small Scandinavian country and I only take 10% of profits. I can't afford to build or tra I can't afford to build or train a sales team for them myself. Yeah, you need to change that deal structure. It's just too much work for too little upside, so I'm torn. Do I go international, work with bigger clients who already have sales teams, and double down on what I'm good at, which is just volume. Uh, or do I stay in market, partner with deep, one to two clients, take ownership, and build everything from scratch, sales included. Would love your perspective. Um, I don't know that it necessarily needs to be one of these one or the other or even these two, but stay in local market. I assume you mean then you just are right now doing it for Scandinavian country. Uh, there are agencies that you can hire that fully do sales. They take 20% and they crush. I don't know if they're within your market might be the issue for that. Um, but yeah, I mean, if you're doing high ticket, you're going to need a sales team. So, you either need to create the team and then I would change your deal structure because this is this is not good um for what you're trying to do. So, if you're going to start building all these pieces for them entirely and they aren't doing it on their own, you need likely larger than 10%. Um, especially because you're going to be hiring a sales team that's going to eat into profits and then it's just going to like make you make less at some level. It's it's it's going to help scale, but like not. So, we talked to a guy on I I talked to a guy on the on YouTube, Ahmed. I think it's the second video in there, but he does this for trading communities, and they take a percentage. They basically do what you're saying. So, they like do all this. They do will basically help with everything. So they'll help with the product, they'll help with the structure, they'll help with the marketing sale, they'll do all of it. And for that, they get a percentage of actually rev share instead of a net profit share. So I don't know your deals, but I would do that or look at that option. And then this go international and work with bigger clients. Like yeah, if you have the skill set of being able to do what you're doing here for generating clients like all this cash, you can find other clients that already have these other pieces built and you don't have to just like try and like square peg round hole or whatever it is where you are trying to just stay within your local market. I mean, if it's a hot niche and you own it and you know it, but like all you have to do is sales, like solve for the sales and change your deal structure. But if they can only get so big because of the TAM, and I don't know what that is, but I would Yeah. I mean, you definitely have the skill set. if you can do this, I would assume uh to be able to go international or, you know, next country over. I don't know exactly how, you know, all that works with how you guys do it. I know there's a lot of guys who like crush in Germany. I know there's a lot of guys who crush in uh France, but yeah, I would look at that. So, one of those two. I I agree with your thinking around this though. So, hopefully that was helpful. And then same thing, you can DM me if you have more questions. How to frame a front-end course in a way that gets a three to five conversion to a high ticket. Is there a framework you use to build these front ends or is it more of a back-end setter closer thing? Uh, yes, it's both. Um, so a big issue that a lot of people will have is they will create a low ticket that can sell, but the low ticket does not lead them to a back a backend. So you can sell a thousand low tickets, but if none of them or if the product itself either cannibalizes, is completely not it's not congruent with the backend, it is never going to convert into a high ticket. It's never going to ascend. So for us, what you're going to do, and depending on if you already have a product or not, you essentially want to go in the direction of what you're selling up here and peacemeal it in very small chunks. So for example, for our thing, um, we have, you know, backend that's this onetoone coaching to get XYZ result in the whatever. Over here in the front, we're going to sell little pieces around the messaging. So here is how you do it in the nutrition portion. And here is a little nugget on how you do it in the mindset or the um menopause or the whatever little bucket that is a micro course, an info thing that is packed with value, no doubt. But where does the real value come from? Uh you know, where do all of our main results come from? Is you not just doing it yourself and trying to do it from, you know, this course and other little like YouTube videos and online? You need a onetoone coach. You need the personalization. So you need them to be able to stair step. And then also for us to get this like I talked to a guy on this the other day that has a 50% from uh ascension rate but he's selling a mid ticket not a low ticket. So, when you're saying front-end course, there's a lot of ways you can do this, but I know guys who sell 297 course up to 2K course direct to cart and then from there they will ascend them via this kind of model where they book in like a quick start implementation call, get on the phone with a closer and then uh so they talk to a setter and then they get set with a closer and then the closer will sell them on something that's 7K, 10K, 20K. And he was even saying live, he's like, "Yeah, we have a 30 to 50% ascension rate for us because it's so low ticket and there's such a discrepancy where it's, you know, under 50 bucks and then over, you know, 5K." Ours is, yeah, closer to those numbers, 3 to five. Uh, and the math works really well for us because that keeps us, I mean, that's that's a low CPA. If you keep your cost to acquire a front-end purchase down uh, pretty low, then that those numbers work out really well. So, it just kind of depends. But you do, if you're focused on ascension, you want this. Some of the big guys in the space I know that do 12 15 million a month do this exact model they do a two a 2k then they book in a setter call setter talks to them for an hour goes through everything and it's basically like yeah but the real way to get results more or less is like to do it one-on-one or to get help with it and it's that classic like do-it-yourself over here information and I I would even go a step further and chunk out the do-it-yourself because you don't want to cannibalize your offer either because that's like an issue we have or we're going to have. We were selling an info product that was a thousand bucks or 1,500 bucks at one time. Uh that was everything a toz like the craziest deep dive of things and then we had coaching on the back and it's like the only difference was that you got a coach and personalized but like all the information was in there and it kind of cannibalized it both because the prices were too close and then also because like the the uh delivery the value like the the difference between them was not large enough. So you don't want to cannibalize and then you want to make sure that it is in the direction that there's a straight line that you can it makes sense why someone would buy this who would want this has to be the same person that is the ICP for both those structure I have no idea what you mean but I'm attempting to be more structured that's what I'm doing with all the ops and the company right now and then also with personal I talk about it a lot but my time blocking and personal structure is right now I need to be much better at that and I'm doing a terrible job currently run my own beat B main offer is selling payment terminals with a few different upsells that focus on digital presence marketing like SEO, Google Ads, website overhaul, and an online ordering delivery system. My team is currently hovering around 100K a month in total revenue across all sources, but my biggest issue I'm running into is lead generation as all my clients have been acquired through to word of mouth. Any recommendations on what to look out for and resources? Okay, so you're crushing and your issue is lead genen and is consistency around this. So this is just an all this is referrals, this is partnerships, this is organic content, this is paid, right? And there's nine other ones, I'm sure, but you just need consistency around that. So whether it's referrals and and usually what this comes down to is having like a really solid product offer and as long as you have that, all of those work. So if you know you need to be able to differentiate, I don't know if that's something that's like stands out strong as a differentiated product, but referral systems are the best by far. um by far because they have the highest show rates, highest close rate, the highest pre-rust rate, all those things because they come from someone. Organic is probably next up. Partnerships are really solid. If someone already has your customer and then will you can pay them 2,000 or whatever your CPA is, call it $2,000. Someone else has your customer and they're like they sign up for XYZ shopping cart thing and they now need a payment terminal and you can partner with them and you pay them 2,000 bucks for everybody they sell send over or percent or whatever like an affiliate deal. That's really good for consistency if their business is consistent. You're kind of like two steps in. Organic content is great. Uh whether you have it for paid or not or or whether you have it instead of paid or not. Uh I would do organic content and build a brand around that because then when you do start to run paid if you want to, the organic content exists. You have a moat. People can consume it. Um paid just comes down to the math. So, I don't know what it's going to cost you. And I would have to understand this model a little bit more. But you'd want to create an offer that you can run ads to that get solid click-through rate, that get solid clicks, that get solid information, you know, information form fills, uh, or booked calls, and then you just have to do the math. So, that one's kind of gray area, but like there's a lot of ways to go about this. All you need is consistent lead flow. Uh, Horoszi's book, uh, $100 million leads, which is is probably just like read that book and you'll have 12 ideas. B2B solarreneurs that work with small businesses, how to scale and what to look for. Is it even something worth doing? B2B soloreneur that work with small businesses. How to scale. Um, yeah. So, I think what you mean is I actually don't know what you mean really, but I think you're just like a solo guy that does service work for small businesses and how to scale. That's kind of vague, but how to scale is doing more of the same, building team to fulfill on it. you do generally have an issue like if you did all like snow removal companies for example small business I don't know if you're doing multiple niches but that's hard because they have different seasonality they have different struggles they have different everything um so if you're doing one business call it snow removal again there's major seasonality and stuff like that there's also like a really high churn rate of who goes out of business or how high they can scale so you almost need more volume of actual businesses you work with instead of being able to just go really deep with certain clients you need a lot of them so there's Just a lot of factors there. Um, is it worth doing long term? Yeah. I mean, you can have great business with that. You can have high recurring MR. You can have a lot of things. Um, yeah. So, I don't know. I don't fully understand that. So, maybe submit another one for next week. That's a lot deeper context. Love the videos. How do you come up with your video ideas? I get that you talk from your experience. What would you recommend that someone who's an intermediate level business? Uh, my video topics are terrible. My I have very little search. I have very little things that stand out. any YouTube pro, any anything is like your ideation blows, your titles suck, your thumbnails are worse, um your intros are bad. Like I have not removed myself as a cog from the machine to like change my strategy really other than to be like, "Oh, cool. I'm going to start doing interviews with people um or whatever you want to call those, podcasts, interviews, just conversations. But I come up with video ideas basically by looking at overarching on what I'm doing on a daily or weekly basis. So like right now I'm obviously heavy on this operations stuff and department levels and management. So like I'm talking more about that. In the beginning we were trying to fix marketing a lot. So we were talking about the different funnels all these different stuff. We were launching the different math behind those. Um so thus far for the last two months it's basically just been me sharing what is currently happening in the business and what's currently happening now. And then I also had the whole you know first month basically where it was me able to just share what I'm do like what we have done. You know I can talk about I could talk about any of these things. I talk about an opt-in page for 20 minutes. I can talk about the VSS. Like I could go page by page of a funnel. I can do a full funnel overview. I can talk about the automations behind it. I can talk about specific flows of the automation. Like you can just go as deep as you want in each one of these depending on how much you're willing to share. But I think the where I've kind of landed that doesn't take a lot of prep is like just what's happening now. It's so fresh on the brain. I can create a loom in 10 minute or a miro in 10 minutes and go through what we're actually doing or like structurally and then I can just yap for 10 20 30 minutes easily because it's just so fresh in the brain. But I feel like that would be difficult if you're not doing things on a daily basis. Um which kind of goes back to my like dumb I'm working 14 16 hour day thing. Like I don't need to be necessarily. I'm just kind of scattered and it's you know a little a little gray area and like choppy. So hopefully that's helpful. But intermediate level business I don't I'm back and forth in this. Like I didn't share any of this. We're technically an intermediate level. Like we only do whatever a few million a month. Like I know guys who do 10 and 50 and you know I don't I know guys who do 10 in this space and there are guys who do like 40 50 in this space and more and other spaces that do hundreds and like why did I choose now to share? I don't know when it makes sense to or not but yeah that's kind of my view. What's in your crypto portfolio? Uh I have had so much ETH for so long and it's just miserable honestly. That's my simple answer for you. I have like six or seven things probably, but and like you know 92 wallets and all this stuff, but I just have fun with it. It's however much in ETH and then I'll do memecoin stuff that's fun. So I do have a large amount of soul just for sport, but that's about it. I don't really do stuff like that. I've just lost more than I've won. I've had deal opportunities that I've said no to and then gone and bought just NFTs that have gone to zero and then at the same time those deals in like real life have gone on to like 100x like three times. So, I'm not a person you should ask about my uh investing skill in either active or passive. How do you think about the following team comp amount questions? How do you figure out what's competitive? What percentile band are you generally targeting? How much are you willing to deviate from different calibers of candidates? How often do employees have their compact just change? There's a good one. Um, all right. So, how do you figure out what's competitive? There are so many tools you can do this, but you know, everything from glass door to I think, yeah, glass door, I think. Um, glass door to there's so many ways online to just find out what's competitive. You're also going to ask them what they want to make, which is going to be an interesting indicator of where they land. Uh, what percentile band are you targeting? High. Generally, we almost exclusively have like North America t uh talent and that's the most expensive to my understanding for what we're doing, which is also not the smartest thing. Like you have people like Iman who talk about all his global talent and he'll get positions that are fantastic that are like ride or dies for a third of what I will and 1099 depending on how you you know it's structured. Ours is all W2. So we over I don't want to say overpay in terms of like but it's just higher in compared to global markets. Um, how much are you willing to deviate for different calibers of candidates? A lot examples like strong leaders. We have put in place some KPI structures that are that do protect us but will make them exorbitant amounts of money. So, I know other people who, you know, their sea level will never make over 300 grand a year. Um, I know people who have been almost poached from our or not almost but have been requested to be poached from our company to go work at some big people's uh companies that you would know the names of and the comp plans are 250 350 you know to run larger stuff than we do and ours sometimes pay more than that which is like just goes to show like it's just a skill we haven't developed to where we're either hiring because the other thing is the internet marketing culture and like the online marketing this whole space like everyone thinks that they deserve to be a millionaire for their skill set just because they're in the space and it's like that is what it is. Um, but I don't necessarily I mean it's just not true. It's like if you're not the owner and you don't have the risk associated and you're not doing all the other pieces and you are running just fulfillment or just CS or just product or or I'm sorry or just marketing or just whatever like generally speaking unless it's a very large company that you're not getting to those seven figure ranges. um unless you're one of the huge drivers and then again it has to be KPI direct so the company continues to make money uh and makes more money per because if not it's just like you know that that team will make more than ownership and then it's like okay well then they should go have their own thing and then because you're just you're just running a business to make them more money and everyone needs to win is like a big thing here like and our people have been paid very well very well um and our team is yeah so we definitely pay on the higher band but how often are having employees how how often are employees having their comp packages changed. We try not to do it that often. I mean, if you're asking for like raises and stuff like that, it's incremental. It is not super structured right now. We are baking in things on like fulfillment side right now that are uh 10-year recognition style thing that are paid out in one-time bonuses at the end of that term. So, instead of just raising the floor, we're doing, you know, after three years, after five years, you get this spiff that hits on that uh on that anniversary essentially. Um so, that's for that one. And then compense changes, there are some increases that will happen on kind of some of the more standardized roles. And then when things break the KPIs, we have to redo them. So sales comp, for example, can break them because you didn't know what this and this could happen at these close rates or this volume. You run that for two months and you're like, we're paying too much or we're paying too little. Like that happens. um some things around marketing. If it's like a CPA driver and you set it all up and then all of a sudden it just blows through the metrics you put on there because something happened in sales or something happened with, you know, a partnership deal or something, you need to change them. But only on stuff like that do we try to do that um or make changes. That was a good one. How do you push a digital course using just organic on Twitter? I have no idea. I'm not good at Twitter. Uh been selling on Twitter since 2001. You Okay, you're going to know better than I am. uh with the 3 to 5k a month, but since Elon bought it and added a four page went down 5x and now barely scraping by. Niche is dating so tons of third world followers. Tried an ebook, a free ebook, but only in an Indians and other countries. Signed up with the same free Telegram group. Before Elon took over, I had 3 to 500 clicks a day. At the moment, I average 150 with 40 to 50 tier one. Low six figures on X at the moment. That's But that means nothing since Algo is screwed. Yes. It just sounds like you don't have an audience or like a you don't you no longer have you relied on the algo of one single platform that changed its rules and now you're there. So you your your clicks basically only went in half but your rev dropped way more than half which or your average profit dropped way more than half. So yeah, you just I mean you understand what you need to solve for. You need to solve for clicks and views. So I don't know if you know your economics well enough to know what you can pay. I don't know if I've never run ads on X directly. I've heard people talk about it, but I know that people do it and some people have really good results with it. So maybe there's a play where you can do some version of that, even if it's just paying to show up in front of your own audience that you have because what it sounds like is your stuff is no longer showing for because for you, you would think extends and gets you more reach. So creating content and stuff that actually is good and gets the clicks that you're talking about versus just XYZ that if you're posting the same stuff and you're now getting a less result, it's like you need to post new stuff to get a different result if the algo changed and is no longer in your favor or you need another acquisition source. So instead of doing it just organic and you do paid instead of or you can do, you know, boosts and people are in my DMs like, "Oh, you want these shout outs or these retweets for this thing?" Like I don't do any of that, but I'm sure people do it and crush it. So, I don't know enough about this, but yeah, you just need more consistency around this with the right quality people. So, if it's not, if you're no longer getting, you know, at some level you're getting shadowbanned for your own audience, uh, or you're just not showing to them, you need to either have better content so you do show to them or other people is probably just the easiest answer. Or you need to boost it in some way to get to that audience. Um, or like you're saying, like pushing them to different platforms. So, you grow this on Instagram, you grow this on YouTube, you grow this on other platforms. So, just get your lead flow up. So, a lot of people have asked about that today, but it's, you know, consistency around lead flow, paid partnerships, affiliate, organic. There's like a lot of options, but you just need to master one. How would you recommend someone become a killer at Facebook ads? Because besides trial and error, uh, trial and error, just kidding. Um, but there are tons of guys on YouTube, so many. And then there's a bunch of people with paid. A lot of people now with the paid have like communities and groups. I'm sure there's ones on I know there's ones on schools that are like Facebook ad mastery. There's different layers within that. It's guys who do physical products, there's guys who do info, there's guys who do lead genen. So, you just got to kind of pick your lane and then find those people on whatever platform and start following them, consuming their free stuff. And then if you want to pay the $50 a month or 500 a month or whatever, I mean, our CMO is kills kills it at Facebook ads in info specific and he still to this day will be talking. He'll be like, "Oh, you got to go pop to a workshop." And he gets on with a bunch of other guys that are in the trenches running ads still on a daily basis. What's working now? I talked about that lead genen guy earlier who crushes it. They do a weekly call where they all talk and you know one week it's like oh yeah or not one week but like yeah I guess one week someone will bring up oh these you know bidcap CBO this this and this is like really crushing for us right now. I heard it from this ecom guy and then everyone starts doing it and then for two months they're all crushing it on that because for whatever reason that's what the algo is doing or like whatever. So yeah, Facebook ads is all-encompassing. It's um it's creative. It's the media buying. It's the understanding the economics. um when you get to scale. So, I would just do that. Surround yourself with the right people, consume the free stuff, and then move into the paid stuff. Daily update. Hope that was helpful for you guys. Um www.rronclub.comdoc has all these videos. I'm on day 72 in a row of doing these. I am a bit tired today. It is early on a Saturday, so I apologize if the energy is down, but we keep moving forward. So, hit me up on X. Uh if you guys have any questions, I do these weekly, so drop them in here. as you can see how much easier it is for me to answer when you guys give a little more context like this. So, if you can do this uh and fill out this request, it's the easiest way. It's so hard for me to find stuff in Instagram and and XDMs that are like this that are questions like this. It's easy if you're just like here's my stats. Here's what I've done and here's where I either am asking a question or want to, you know, do something. But, this is the easiest way is to submit the form. So, that's all. Um and then our daily update. I'm going to do a more official one of these soon, but we are we're cooking along. So, we're in the two millions this month already. um mid mid twos already. So, we're having a big uptick from the things that we changed with marketing and sales and we're just sprinting. We're just full full running. So, uh I will have a great update for you at the end of May. Um that will be super helpful and talk about what we did right, what we did wrong, how we solved our bottleneck, and hopefully be very helpful. So talk to you guys soon.
