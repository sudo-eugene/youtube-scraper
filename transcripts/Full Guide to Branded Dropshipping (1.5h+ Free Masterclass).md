Feel like I need no shirt. What's up, guys? Today's video we have Mark Builds Brands. I'm sure you guys have seen him on YouTube. He does great raw videos like I do in the branded drop ship and personal development, I guess you call it, space. So, Mark, kick it off. Let's hear the intro. Who are you? Yeah, what's up, dude? I'm Mark Brands. Uh, I run ads on the internet, mostly for e-commerce brands, most of them my own. uh been in game since 2018. Standard kid that was trying to figure out how to make money on the internet. Came across e-commerce and was one of the few ones who actually stuck with it while it was really difficult and spent a lot of time to figure it out. And since then bounc bounced around from, you know, doing ecom the whole time, but also some info from software, some sass. So, let's [ __ ] rip it, man. Let's have a good time. Hell yeah. All right. Well, let's talk about the drop ship stuff. So, I watched some of your stuff on your channel. I mean the stuff that clearly pops for you or like your keyword, you know, you own is in that like branded drop. So what does that mean? Like what what do you what does that directly mean? I'm not in ecom that much. Like I've flaked around with it. I've played, but I've never everything I've mainly done has been info coaching. So like what's hot? Well, branded drop shipping is kind of the argument against like traditional drop shipping which kind of started started popping off mostly in 2017 and then it got really big in like you know postco like 2020 2021. But drop shipping is great for like one main reason and that's you can get like validation that a product is actually working and profitable successful without having to go and bulk order all this stock. That's like the main argument for like pro drop shipping. But there's all these downsides that nobody really talks about when it comes to like actually building a real business. Namely, uh, every payment processor [ __ ] hates you. You get banned by every platform that you try to run ads on, Facebook, Google, Tik Tok, everything. You have pretty much a terrible relationship with your customers unless you happen to have like a really specialty shipping line where you can ship quickly and actually have good quality products. So, branded drop shipping was kind of bored where you can still use drop shipping as a fulfillment model, which really that's all it is. It's nothing more than a way to fulfill your products. Yeah. Um, but you can build a real brand in a process and use that as a way to get your brand off the ground because it is very cost effective. And then once you have that validation that, hey, I can actually sell this product to people on the internet and they'll pay me for it. Then you can transition into like a real brand, you start ordering stock, holding it in 3PLs, etc. So that's where I like the branded drop shipping term. Um, just drop shipping in general has a lot of [ __ ] in there in the first place. So branding drop branded drop shipping is like where you can build a great business like long story short. Yeah. So the goal is to start as drop shipping then move into your own style or are you is that like the main play? Yeah, start start drop shipping. It should look like a brand from day one but like looking like a brand and being a brand two different things. Yeah. So you start with the drop shipping fulfillment model. You get to whatever that period is for you where you're actually generating good money. Maybe that's like, you know, 10k a month, 30k a month profit, whatever. Then they actually take that profit, go ahead and invest in stock that is custom. It's yours. It's higher than the 3PL and stand for filling. You increase the relationship with your customers, increase your repeat purchase rate, all that [ __ ] All right, so let's use an exact example here. So we were messing around with this in like November and we loaded up some dog product store, threw it on a shrine theme, like cranked 10 like 100 grand or like 104,000 or something in a month and basically just broke even. But we were like testing all this stuff. We were just having fun. But like in that example, right, we're doing drop shipping, we're brandingish kind of, but like is product branded and are you using like some what are you using for fulfillment in that? And then what is the difference when you go to your own stock? Are you like making adjustments to the product? Are you just throwing labels on it? Like what's the difference? When you start out there's you're basically selling like unbranded products. So you can you can search from a lot of places. Like I don't use a lot of the big platforms as much. Like you can use Zenrop, you can use CD drop shipping. That's we typically recommend like one of those two options. But because we've been doing this for so long, I've been doing this since since 2018. Like I said, we have connections where we can use agents from like day one. But yeah, that's essentially it. You're selling unbranded products. Like you can search for products on Amazon and unless they're patented, you'll find like 10 different people selling virtually the exact same thing and all they're doing is private labeling, which is like a process in actually like building a real brand, right? So that's basically the process. And that experience that you just said, by the way, is like a universal [ __ ] cannon event for like 90% of drop shippers. Like they figure out how to actually make sales, make zero profit, and then usually they're like, "So it's a scam." Or they're all they stick with it and like figure out how to actually be profitable with it. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Cuz uh I don't want to like, you know, say names, but there are some big guys now that used to do this kind of space and that was basically what they taught is they would be like just they would load up a general store. It was like OG days. This is probably around that same time frame, but this is when I was still in that or like interested in watching all that content. And they would do a general store. They would basically send ads to a bunch of these different ones on just like a normal product page. The ones that got a couple sales were basically like, you know, half liquidating basically. They would then take that, load it up on like a ClickFunnel style thing, and go more direct response. They would start selling, you know, 50 units a day. Then when they hit that, then they would go to this like drop like, you know, uh custom customize the product and go that route. So interesting. Okay. Okay. And then what's the what's the play right now? What's hot with funnelish? Is it drop funnel? You know, like what do people use? I see you talk about all the time and I want to go deep in your AI land because you're hot on like that's your like zone right now. I see you talking about it all the time. I see you, you know, making chats about it, private groups. So like what do you guys do for advertorials? What do you like tech stackwise? What is working now? Dude, it's really interesting because it you know you you've been in Infair for a while. I've done the info and when you look at the the history of direct response, the info marketers were typically pretty far ahead from e-commerce guys in my opinion. I don't know why it is, but one of my mentors who's now my business partner, Alex, and he got really early into using avitorial funnels with e-commerce specifically. And it was like him and a few like affiliates that were doing it. and he just took products that were like what what would be considered like saturated products, build an avitorial funnel around them, and just absolutely rip like crazy. Like you compare like a standard funnel to an avitorial funnel, he would just destroy them all day long with a saturated product. So people are like, "How is this possible? Oh, like you can't sell saturated product." No, it's just you you suck at selling it. Like all advitorial is is being able to con uh convey your sales message in a different way. And when you're doing what most people don't do, you typically get the results that most people don't get, which is good results. Yeah. So, in terms of like what's hot, I mean, I guess you could say that's hot right now. It's definitely becoming more prof uh more popular. But, dude, I like we've been doing this for a long time. Like, I didn't start talking about it until really last year because I was just pissed off. Like, that's if people want to know why I started my YouTube, it's cuz I was [ __ ] pissed off about all the [ __ ] out there on the internet, man. Yeah. Like people had been saying the same [ __ ] [ __ ] the same strategy for so long. Like just build a store, find a product, use this ads by tool, uh run Facebook ads. If it's not profitable, it's all the product. It's nothing else. It's only the product. Move on to the next one until you like strike gold. Yeah. And for me that was that was such a stupid strategy because once I like indoctrinated myself with direct response and I understood that there's a lot more than just a product that goes into being successful. It was like this uh this wall that was broken in my head and I actually understood that you can sell most products if you're a good enough marketer. Yeah. Most of them. Not not all of them but most of them. Yeah. And that's that that's why I I started making content because I was like, "Holy [ __ ] everybody's teaching the same [ __ ] There's like no innovation in the space." Not that even what I was doing was innovative. It had been around for years that nobody was talking about it except for except for Alex. I was like, "I'm just going to show some people what's working for us, see how it goes." And yeah, people apparently liked it. Yeah. No, they definitely liked it. Uh, as you can see, but what So, I remember that from like OG days. And when I first was hearing about that, that was probably I was like learning natives like dude, I bought every course. I tried to learn every angle and everything and never took any of them to completion. That's why, you know, this is the first like, you know, big thing. But I played around with it and everyone was doing that with and I heard I watched one of your videos the other day and you talked about this. It's like if you scroll down to you know M on MSN or whatever and you see these things down here, these are all advertorials and it's like are you guys running them? What kind of traffic sources? Everything. Yeah, bro. You name it. like Facebook, Google, YouTube, uh Tik Tok, Snapchat native, uh Apploven. Yeah, basically all of them. Yeah, that's crazy. We still only run like we only run the course. We don't touch any of that stuff. Like not even like retarget, no like nothing. I mean, you know, the farthest we'll go on something like that is like basically GDN. Yeah, I still think dude that Facebook is is king. Like Facebook is king. Tik Tok is a close second. So like in terms of our spend allocation, it's still very heavy on Facebook. Still works. so freaking well. It's like it's like a bread and butter, but we still do use the other platforms. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know if you talk numbers and you can shut me down if so, but like what kind of spends you guys do? I mean, I know you have multiple things you do, but on like one of these big stores, like what's your what what kind of spends? No, like right now. Yeah. Or just like Yeah. Or when it has been hot. I don't know if these are es and flows or if this thing's like a, you know, evergreen consistent scaling, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't know your game. I don't know your space. I just watch your stuff. I crack my I mean I laugh and I just have fun with it but like I don't know anything about that world. It's entrepreneurship. There's always like es and flows as you know like Yeah. I'm not super familiar with a a stable business. Yeah. Me neither, dude. I looked this morning cuz I was actually curious and then I shut up because people are going to yell at me for talking too much. But uh I looked and I was like, "All right, what how much rev have we done? How much cash collected have we done since I started doing these videos?" And I like did the math on it and I was like, "Oh, that's like interesting." Like the the average is so low because we were in such talk about entrepreneurship. We were in such a bad pocket and I was just like beating the drum making these videos and this last like half of the month is like double like we have like like you look at the chart and it's like this and I'm like okay cool but you know daily I was like we lost 30 grand today we lost we were doing this like this is real like this happens but yeah no man that that happens all the time. I mean full transparency in one of our brands last month was [ __ ] dog [ __ ] bro. It was like we weren't profitable in one of our brands last month. Yeah, fortunately we have multiple brands, multiple businesses. Um, so it's it's like you're always weathering the storm to some degree. It's just like how big of a hit can you take and like not flinch. Yeah. Um, but really now we're we're obviously not doing anything super crazy. I would say like you know 1 to 1.5 million a month in spend. Yeah. Um, you know, across all the all the brands, let's say between 2 to 3 million a month. So it's it's nothing really that crazy. Like just one of our brands should be doing that and I'm pissed off that it's not like that's not a flex by any means. I feel like a tiny fish in a big pond. I feel like I'm not doing [ __ ] [ __ ] Yeah, I dude I feel you. The more I start to like talk around about this and like I try and lead with like no ego, no whatever. Like I'm just sharing our numbers cuz like yes, of course there's some clicks and stuff and get people in the right room, but like I try and say over and over again like I'm publicly sharing this. I'm like we did 40 grand yesterday or we did like 60 grand. It's like like there's guys out here like we're friends with the guys that do 15 million a month in ecom and info and whatever. Those guys are small fish in the scheme of like the big boys, right? It's like we're all just playing the same game. But yeah, that's about where we're at right now. We're we're we're less than that in spend, but we are. Yeah, we're Yeah. trailing those numbers. So, by the way, real quick, I don't know if this is the right time to say this, but your content is so [ __ ] good. Like, you guys that are watching need to understand this. He didn't tell me to say this. He didn't pay me. I swear to you, but on my YouTube, I don't subscribe to anybody. Literally, I have two subscriptions active on my YouTube account. One is this guy that makes really good music that I like and I listen to it when I'm working. It's like a very niche music and then the other guy is you and you have Yeah. just the quality of content and you you know when people know what the [ __ ] they're talking about. That's another thing like about e-commerce especially. I know if these guys really know e-commerce. I know it within the first 30 [ __ ] seconds. I know if you're doing it for content or if you're doing it for ecom. It's it's very easy to tell and I think it's the same for you. Yeah. No, I appreciate that. I mean I'm Yeah. I mean, I'm obviously just running the quantity game and I'm trying to dance in the quality and like it it's hard on some days like it's definitely I'll sit here and I'll be like so like and I've just kind of defaulted to like what is happening now. So like if you look at the beginning it was like kind of like the catchup and it was the marketing tech. It was like what funnels it was like what are the flows? What are the auto like what is basically already existing and built and then as we started to iterate and change the marketing side I was like talking a lot about that then because that's what we were working on. Then we started to work on the sales portion of the company. We talked I talked a lot about sales and like the hiring portion and all that. Now it's like fulfillment op structure and all I'm talking about is like you know the chess game and like trying to play that and it's kind of hard I feel like for someone to just like pick up and like start in one and be like what's going on but like that's what's happening. I'm talking about what's happening on like a daily weekly basis and I'm doing them every day. So it's like I don't know I find I find it hard to do the you know everyone talks about packaging and you do a fantastic job of that. Like I look at yours and it's like there's so much intent. you send me that video talking through some like you know ideation stuff and it's like you have this intent behind it you have this you have it goes through here you have like pre-done and like but still raw right which I appreciate because anything that has that editing nowadays I'm like click through like you know zoom through two and a halfx find some nugget move on to the next move on to the next so I appreciate that though thank you so yeah dude I I I'm sending her videos to my COO like at least once a week oh good yeah well I'm the fumbling around I mean technically on paper I think I'm CTO but I you know COO or whatever it is. I'm just I'm trying to figure it out. I mean, really what it's turned into is like co-founders, you know, CEO, sales, marketing, the vision guy, and then I've just kind of come in as like integrator more so as we've scaled and like for a long time I was just like tech and like kind of systems and ops, but like mainly tech and like I understand I was always on the pulse on marketing. I was always on the pulse on like what was happening everywhere. We trained the sales reps. We were taking it like but as this began to scale I was doing like you know four to six hours a week like less than that of meetings and just kind of like doing my thing and we were going to just cash flow business it and call it a day and you know minority I came in I was number five in the company not a co-founder co-owner not a co-founder and this last whatever five month or I guess longer than that now seven months we're like let's just turn the knob let's just take this to like whale size because we're just so friends with these guys that it's like the model's there it's like just execute on it it's just push it Why? What led you to that line of thinking that you're like, "All right, guys, we got to like step the [ __ ] up and like see what we can do with this." Uh, my selfishly, like my life changed a lot. Like I changed some priorities around. I was kind of on the hunt for like what I wanted to build. Like this was already in that space in place. We had like conversations around, you know, the owners and what we wanted to do with it. Cuz I literally can remember sitting there all together. We went to a mastermind thing that was for e-commerce, which is hilarious, but we used it as a trip. We all went together. We're sitting at breakfast and we're like, "What are we gonna do with this thing?" We're like redefining mission values per like all this stuff. And we're like, "Do we just want to cash flow this? Do we just want to have like just do 10 million a year and then just do like 30% margins and just like call this a day and just like have it home? We have great team. Get them paid well. Like we've always paid very well and like just stay in that honeypot and then we can explore our other interests. Like are we super interested in you know niche?" I already say on the channel, but like people can go find it, but like I don't really talk about the company name and stuff, but like do we is that like really our passion project? And like we're all into that. We all, you know, do that. We all, you know, we don't look like you, but we're close, right? Like we do that kind of stuff in our own lives, but it's like is that our passion? Do we want to go build some software? You know, we're in this internet marketing game. Do we want to do some physical product thing? You hear everyone who's doing this and that and crushing it. Like the interests were all over the place. And then we're like, we're sitting on this gold mine. and I kind of just started to take things more seriously. I had moved. I was in Puerto Rico and like doing all that stuff. I came up here and was like, "Let's like I want to lean more into this." The rest of the team was like, "Oh, let's restructure this and this and build this in a way that now it goes here." We all kind of sat in our p like got in our pockets of where we're all good. And we're like, "Let's all sprint in our own lanes." Because they're all, you know, they all connect, but like where there was a lot of overlap, a lot of overlap, not a lot of structure. So the thinking was, oh, hey, we're friends with these guys that do, you know, 12 a month with the exact same model. And with this tweak and this tweak, we rammed 71 million through one funnel because we didn't build a marketing division and try other VSSL funnels, try other acquisition, DTAs, low tickets. We didn't try any of that. It was still crazy me when when we first had that call and you're like, "Yeah, we just like rip everything through a VSSL funnel." I'm like, "Yeah, 70 plus million. Straight with the VSSL fun, man. Send scales, I guess." Dude, it's like and again, we send we sell at that time it was 1% of leads. That's it. And everyone else just sat there and like lead being like a call dipped or no like like an opt-in. So, we were just doing 1% of optins would end up actually purchasing the back end. There's nothing else to sell them. There was no further backend other than buy more of the same, which is like another year. The change from us going from 10 to 30 million was changing the offer from an info product to coaching. But coaching comes with costs. Coaching comes with team. Coaching comes with like more things than just selling a login and having group coaching. So the margin difference was like real and the team size was real now and now all of a sudden we're going here and then you're growing W2 and then your sales staff is getting bigger. We were doing insane volume of units when we were doing info but good mar right like these really healthy margins and no future costs. It's just monthly selling info with no coaching at all. Group coaching style kind of group coaching but no like no uh account managers, no coaches, etc. God damn. Yeah, we were selling like a OG ovens style thing. So, we were sell we started it at 500 a month over the phone. I'm sorry, 500 lifetime access, not monthly. 500 one-time purchase and then like a month or two months in change it to a thousand and then change it to 1500 and like you know the payment plans of the four pay 297 and the 39 whatever that stuff and we did everything in-house no external financing and we were doing a million whatever a month with healthy margins uh on that and they were getting login access to Kajjabi a Facebook group and group coaching like group coaching calls through there and we were cranking it and like yeah we had to add a fourth call during the week or something because it was so much volume but like we were all good and then it got to point where we're like how can we we had no backend really like the coaching kind of existed because it was like an earlier thing we tried to do but like I'm talking like a hundred people on coaching with like two or three coaches and then we're like what if we just sell coaching which brings the ticket up to like six seven whatever K and at that time I think we were selling it for five or six when we started and that plus bring a new sales manager in instead of us trying to run it or have these like agency style guys who at the time were not give us 20% and we'll just slang it and build our own SDR team in sales which I would have hired in two seconds if that existed. Instead, we built we tried to do the 1099 sales manager route and it was just it was just a mess. So, we scaled but that's how we got to 3 million and then acquisition broke. It wasn't sales. I mean, it was it was acquisition. It was ramming it all through that funnel. It was cost per call going from call it 300 bucks to 700, you know? I mean, it's like that type of game. Pixel issues, trying agencies. We're paying an agency 13% on our spend and we're spending, you know, a million bucks a month. agency 130 grand and CPA is rising month over month. Like it was just bloody. So that burned like you know millions and millions and millions of the profit plus I I talk about this on channel but I like we have partnerships we try to do supplements that ripped and we we lost 1.2 or something on that. We have all the CPA stuff. We have what we're paying agency. You have like team size got too big. We have HR directors moving 1099 W2. Like I can go down the list but you know that's a quick five to 10 mil burn quick. Damn. Wow. Yeah. And we learned, you know, you can try and read in one of these [ __ ] books on the shelf where you can just do it. But like we did it and and it was profitable and it was good and like, you know, it was more profit than when we were doing 10, but it was not more. It would we not hold margin at all. So we like resized in. We're like, okay, let's do a pairing metric. We wanted 30 million. We hit 30.5, but we had no margin like as our goal. We were just like, let's ram it. Vanity metric. And we rammed it. And now it's like settle down, lock in margins, scale up correctly. And now that's where we're at now. So it was like 1.4 four, 1.5, 1.52, 1.59, and now this month it's like it's close. We'll see. I'm I'll make a video at the end, but it should be like three. So, I'm I'm curious when you were just going straight to like the $500 info only 500 then, 1,500, but that's Was that still through a sales call? Mhm. Oh, yeah. What? It worked. It was profitable at those numbers. It was because cost per call. I mean, it was just such a small volume that it worked. So, we tried we we never even tried the direct to cart the webinar the like we we had one that was like the ovens auto 2k like OG webinar one and we tried that and then like it was running in the background at like $100 a day basically while we were trying to do all the other stuff and we never scaled into it and we went straight for the call funnel and then just never looked back. So, but enough about me. Let's get to you. We have lots of questions in these DMs, which is actually hilarious. Uh, because I usually don't get them. Somebody actually asked one, two, three, four, five, six, eight questions. So, let's hit them. Let's go back and forth on them. Best funnels currently working in ecom specifically. We kind of already touched that, but um, as of right now, advtorial funnels do really well. Uh, going to like a listical for stuff that is a little bit more sophisticated in terms of market development works very well. What's the difference on like advator versus listical? I mean, I think I know, but advtorial is it's basically just a stage of awareness that really changes. Like aviators typically are people that are not product aware and listical is like people that are product aware. So like somebody that does a listical really well is joby coffee, like really big DOC brand and it's always like a five reasons why kind of listical. So those work really well, but they're selling coffee. They're selling coffee that has like protein in it. Yeah. So, if you think about the market uh sophistication, like coffee obviously been around forever. They don't have a whole lot of like if you think of a direct response VSSL and running that to sell coffee, you'd be like, "What what the hell are you doing?" Like, you're wasting your time. You don't need to do all of this uh this sales momentum before you sell them the product. Just sell them the product and tell them why you're so different than everybody else. They're like stage four, maybe even stage five uh level of sophistication in their market. Uh avatar is a little bit less. Avatar I like better because you can be more creative with the copy and you can really shape the perception of why your product is better than anything else that they've ever tried and you can build up like this your own story around selling the product. So those work really well. Another thing that's working really well right now is just quiz funnels. So think of uh either VSSL or image ad going directly to a quiz funnel that's typically a little bit on the longer side. So anywhere from like 8 to 20 questions and it gives like this really customized feel. I write them names because some of them are are clients. But where's the where's So where's the VSSL? Is it on platform or is it on page? On platform is is what I was referencing. Yeah. So in feed VSSLs basically. And people run those even without VSSLs. Like sometimes they'll just run image ads straight to the uh straight to the quizunnel. But the cool thing is right after the quizunnel, it doesn't even really go to a sales page. It's more like an offer page. Like it's kind of a hybrid between a sales page and a checkout page. It's like at at this point you have so many micro commitments from them and you don't need to have like a very very long sales page that explains a lot about the product. It's more like just important details and then the buy box. So like maybe it's like a uh a supplement for example that is sold in like 3 month supply, six month supply, nine nine month supply and so it'll just go funnel directly to like the offer page and then check out from there. Yeah. So those are doing really well. Um, dude, outside of that, that's the only thing that is is that's working aside of that is just like simple PDPs, like products that are super [ __ ] simple and just send traffic to a really well-designed PDP. I mean, one of our friends uh who owns um Avi, which is like a uh, you know, in the health space D brand, they're going to do like over $50 million uh this year, like well over 50. And it's so simple. like they have majority of the revenue coming from one skew. They um they have one main like PDP that they run the traffic to. Like to some people sounds like a dream since I'm like extra as [ __ ] and a little bit [ __ ] I like having like the full formal architecture and like you know these have sales and down cells and all [ __ ] but yeah that's what's working well right now. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So the next one was around the VSSLs but like basically talking pre-lander pages and I'm curious. So you see these guys that do, you know, the affiliate, anything that's on a network looks like this, but they do the headline VSSL, the cookied, you know, CTA that's waiting. Do you guys do any of that or like what what's the time for that? Cuz we're we're and and also some context and background is like we're talking about when we're going to do this. We're talking about initially starting it internal for like anything we do physical brand or like physical product wise is going to be for like to test and to an easier sales cycle is going to be internal to customers like post-purchase for the coaching but we are talking like is there a play where we can go front end we can go straight to you know through paid and do that and there's VSSL direct like all you know any clickbank anything that's supplement is that there's any of those guys like what what's the time for that versus not oh it's Actually a fantastic question. So one of my friends, actually friend of a friend runs uh two of the top supplement offers on ClickBank and yeah, this is exactly what they do, dude. It's it's very very simple ads on the front end. Get people all to this VSSL page. Pretty long VSSL, like 30 to 50 minutes long and then just standard like you know direct response [ __ ] after that. For us, we actually don't do this and and there is a reason for it. If you think of the for us like the most one of the most important values in in my company is speed. Like money loves speed, right? Yeah. And we're actually slightly moving away from testing as many VSSLs. And the reason why is because they take so much more time to iterate on. If I can have an an asset like some type of ad, for example, an image that I can test, you know, 10 times the number of of ads of statics of ad copies that I can compare to something like a video sales letter, then I'm I'm going to do that. And if I can get the same performance out of it, I'm 100% going to do that. So that's that's something we've been moving towards a lot. We don't do like straight to a VSSL like that because we do VSSLs in feed and even that dude we're like it sounds like a dream and it is when you find that one really really good VSSL because it does crank for a long time as you [ __ ] know you ran that one VSSL for so so much [ __ ] cash. Yeah, it takes it takes a lot of time to find and then eventually that VSSL is going to die and it takes a lot more time to find that new winner than if you were to just constantly be iterating with with assets that take less time to produce. Although obviously part of that is even less of a obstacle now because of AI, especially with like V3 that just recently dropped and now you can basically create VSSLs exactly as you want them start to finish and there's like the amount of time for you to curve something like that goes down substantially with tools like that. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, because I guess I didn't think about that for us because we just hammered that one. But like we have and the cost behind them, the time behind them for so we're doing multiple brand faces now. So, we're having multiple angles with multiple faces that are like in the in the buyer demo, but we just had them go out somewhere, physically shoot in person, so we could control the filming and all that side of things, not just, hey, shoot this on your own in wherever state or country or whatever you live in and then send it to us and we'll do everything after. We did that whole portion. Then once we got it back, it's or once we finished those, now it goes off to the best of the best editors that are 20 grand, 30 grand for VSSL. Crazy behavior. I mean like we got quotes for two to five that are like okay people are like recommended but the best of the best are 20 30 grand and they're unbelievable once you get them and we do stuff I don't know if you've seen our I mean we'll do vertical ones we'll do horizontal we have both of them that are like on the same tempo so you can have it on the same page and like if they go back it's you know similar but you're not wrong like the speed to do it and then Peter Kelly's talked about he's like you know nine of them in a row flop and then one hits and you're doing 100k a day from it but the iteration on that is crazy I didn't think about that is true I mean you're doing one VSLs for a while. So, I'm not I'm not like [ __ ] on VSSLs. I actually really love VSSL. I love writing them. Uh the editing thing is incredibly true. Like, we have in-house editors, but I have paid people outside and they're charging like anywhere from like$100 to $400 per minute of the VSSL. And if it's long for a VSSL, bro, oh my god, dude. We internally we test as many as like 200 VSSLs in a week. Can you imagine? No. No, I can't. That's crazy. I like my marketing tech brain is like like just breaks because that's the other thing is like testing those things and like setting them up. We use Vidalytics. I've heard that's dumb because of bandwidth and other people use these other ones that are just like it but like you know looking through stats on those things trying to split them correctly how they got there understand the context how much is enough data when you're running at size like before you can split and tell like then you change a lead on one of them and it crushes the other one by nine times and you're like what just happened and then you just crown that for x amount of time but then it doesn't back out the same on bookings or on purchases but it does on bookings and it's like there's just it's just eggs. It's just eggs. It's just you know you're constantly playing that. So yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense, huh? Yeah, that's perfect, man. It's there are a lot of pieces, but it's like there's no other game that I'd rather play. It's like a [ __ ] jigsaw puzzle, you know? You like you assemble one piece and then another piece and then 30 other pieces break when you assemble those and you have to like reput everything together. Yeah. What about writing them? You said you write them cuz when you guys are doing like these 200 or whatever, I mean, we can get into the AI stuff a little later, but like you guys are writing them generally in house. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We write them all in house. Yeah. Yeah, we've had our top performers have come from our copyriter that we've had since like OG days who literally might as well be our brand face. We joke like two emails a day every day for years. Like just it they just have the voice. We've paid 15, we've paid 25, we've paid like some bigger numbers to external guys and then had and then shot them internal which again is more variables and then had it edited which is more variables and done that. But one of them has cooked for us like multiples higher in rorowaz just on just on like smaller tests that we're about to roll out into bigger ones and multi VSSLs and multiple low tickets. But like there's some power in sending it off to the you know Bensons of the world or the Peter Kels or the those but it's top dollar. So it's like you need your P&L needs to support it or you got to come out of pocket. So yeah, that's interesting. All right. So what else? uh advice on how someone that's scaled into offers that's scal that doesn't make any sense that's scaled into offers to get acclimated to the direct response ecom environment. So basically where do you hang out to learn all things direct response ecom is assume what I assume what that means. Uh dude it's it's kind of sad and unfortunate. There's not a lot of really good direct response circles I feel like anymore. And even I am like quote unquote new into the space. Like the OG the real internet marketing OGs were like 1999 2000 and I've been in the game since then. And one of my mentors is one of those guys. So the like the Were you there in the reformed days? I mean like I know of it and I've like you know been but no not when it was hot. Do you ever go back and look at some of those articles? No I have though. I have like I've looked things up and it brought me there and I've gone down rabbit holes for hours. Yes. But yeah me too. Another one. Mad mad something for the affiliate and lead genen guys. That was Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, um in terms of like right now, man, like if you don't have a good understanding of direct response, I always think it's best to start with the people that were the actual trailblazers, not people like today. Like I never would recommend listening to me. I would go and listen to people that were uh for me like on on my Mount Rushmore, I would think of people like Gary Halbert, Gary Benson Vanguard, like Eugene Schwarz, uh Dan Kennedy, like people like that. garbed out their content because all they did was crack direct response marketing with like direct mail and then when the internet came around we started to transition that you know onto like web pages whatnot. Yeah. So like if you haven't read all the Gary Halbert letters for example like absolutely mandatory reading if like you care about direct response a lot of the Dan Kennedy stuff. Um, and it's just it gives you that like that magic, you know, that little spark that's like, man, these guys were like figuring out how to sell people [ __ ] and like they made these simple stupid mistakes that are stupid to us, but they had to figure it out before we knew that that was stupid. Yeah. So, seeing [ __ ] like that, man, is super super cool. So, I think finding those people that literally are the OGs, starting there, and then there's a few good communities. I I'll shout out my guy uh Al Sultanich. He has a good community. I'm sure you're familiar. Nothing held back. It's very solid. Yeah, been in there for a while and he's taught me a lot. So, that's a good one, too. Yeah, I learned a bunch. I mean, as soon as he dropped that offer, I bought uh Nothing Held Back Plus or whatever the that one middle one was. Guys, they're just they that's their life. They are so good at that. They're it's just like their entire thing is ideiation, copy like that, you know, and Allen's got the brain for economics and the all that and like, you know, hormoney mind when it comes to simplifying things and breaking them out long form, short form. But yeah, what do they say? The the OG's is like the psychology behind it and the new age is like the tactics around it. So like you said, how you apply it to the online space, but in the end, putting it in a piece of direct mail or putting in a Facebook ad is like that's the tactic. That's just like how you do the new It's a new conduit, but it's the same messaging. Have you ever done the, you know, write it all down by hand where you of course? Yeah. You know how many [ __ ] sales letters I used to do this up until 2023. I'd spend 4 hours every day um in in like deep work and at least two hours of those was actually like hand rewriting sales letters and I did that for literally years. I did that. Yeah. No, it's it's a hack. Alan always talks about that. It's like literally Yeah. Just do it. Handwrite them all. I did it with Hellberts and then I was like, what am I doing? I'm not a copyriter. I'm never going to be a great copywriter. It's not my zone. And it's like it's so high leverage if you use it in the right way, but like it's just wasn't where my skill set already was and I was like, what am I doing? And like I might as well just lean into my bucket and then I just leaned in my bucket and but yeah. Yeah. The the issue now, dude, is like people ask me, Mark, like where should I learn how to do direct response copyrightiting? And I'm like I don't even know if you should do that anymore because like AI is getting so freaking good. But the thing is like the big asterisk that is it's only good if you know how to use it. Yeah. And the quality of your output is obviously determined by the quality of your input. So if you're not getting it the right information prompting in the right way, teaching a direct response, then you can't expect good copy and you definitely don't know how to chief it. Like I think that's the most important skill when it comes to learning how to write really good copy is the chiefing process. Which means what? It's basically the the reviewing and revisions of your copy to make sure that it checks all these specific boxes. For example, like is your copy really easy to read? Is the message clear? Does it hit all the necessary beliefs that have to be hit for a prospect to buy? Yeah. Um, is it at like an X uh grade reading level so it's like easy enough to understand? And I have like this, another one is like VOCC, voice of customer. So like are you using your language to write the copy or the cu uh the language of the customer? And but now like even that I have a I have a bot created to do that for me for every brand that I run. So it's like you know I don't even know what to tell these people anymore. Yeah. I when we did the low ticket, I wanted to do it so bad and I was not as much in that like department or world of the company. Like I was but not like I don't know I didn't have enough push in there where like the VSSL funnel was working and I was like let's let's do low ticket like economics you guys got to understand this and nobody wanted to do it. And I spent 3 hours in the morning. I just took somebody else's that was this massive one, fed the entire thing into GPT, gave it all our context, went back and forth, and this was like a year and a half ago, so not new to it, but like still kind of earlier days, and built this entire one. And that was, you know, converting at 7% or something on the front, like just off that. And of course, the copy chief needed to come in there. They came in, rewrote it, went to 11%, you know, like all these other things, but like just to get it live, it was enough. It was plenty enough to get it live and test the concept and like go in that direction and then someone else overlaid on top of it with like correct things or more, you know, proper language of things I don't understand because that's not my lane. But it's crazy that you can go live with three hours and you and a, you know, you and GBT just doing your thing. Dude, that's the thing, right? Because of speed. I'd rather launch imperfect copy that's maybe like an 8.5 out of 10 than spend the extra like you know however many hours chiefing it to [ __ ] perfection or like you know writing the whole [ __ ] thing myself then I read like just to get some [ __ ] data because even what's greater than the copy if you think of like the levers that you can pull like as as as a business owner the copy is even a a lever that is smaller than the power of the offer itself right because you can have very very basic copy but if your offer is so [ __ ] good it's not going matter how good your copy is, the offer does the selling itself, right? Yeah. No, 100%. Well, that te's up the next one, which is daily routine to keep the skills sharp. So, like what what is your focus right now with where you guys are at with the business or multiple businesses? I mean, we haven't really fully talked on I mean, you're doing the branded drop ship. You have that whole multiple brands in that business. What else is kind of going on in in businesses and then we'll go back to where you guys are like where where you're refining skills? I mean, most of my time right now is still spent on on e-commerce. Like, I I wouldn't feel good making content if I didn't feel that way. Same. So, uh keeping my sword sharp is just me working all day. Like, I spend a lot of time um writing ads, writing advtorials, looking at our funnel data, coming up with new split test to launch, almost like a a little nerdy CMO. um and just trying to increase our uh decrease our CPA, increase our return on ad spend because it's basically like running a like running a low ticket to the funnel except you have no high ticket back end. You just have to be profitable on the front. Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that you really have on the back end is like subscriptions. So if you're able to like have subscriptions and you have a good repeat purchase ratio, then you know, good. You can go like negative on the front end. But other than that, you have to be profitable. And since I'm just competitive, I I want to be profitable on the front end. Even if I'm at scale, even if I'm spending like 30 50k a day, I still want to be profitable acquiring customers. That's just how I've been. Yeah. Well, I mean, it works, right? It helps. It's easier. I mean, I don't want to say it's easier. It's probably harder to do that, but easier everywhere after that once you accomplish that. You don't have to worry about your time to cash. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. Like, do you guys do you are some of the brands you have subscription? Yeah, we have subscription. We go back and forth because when you run uh traffic to a subscription offer, you're naturally going to have like a little bit of a lower conversion rate. But uh depends on your economics. You know, what is your retention? What is your turn? If you're able to keep those customers for a while, then you can go, you know, deeper and deeper into the red and still be profitable. So for us, like if in our main brand, I'm thinking for example, it depends on the product. You know, some products have like uh retention for like two months for example, and others have like six. So it depends on uh a lot of different variables. But yeah, we do have subscription built in. I think every brand that wants to exit should have some element of subscription built in. Yeah. So I I end up somehow talking about this with every single person I talk to, but what is stopping you maybe from going just crazy deep or thinking extremely large or something with like one specific thing. And I think you do have some business in your repertoire that you talk about that or that you talked to me at least a little bit about where you are doing that where it's like the bigger play. It's the bigger long-term thing. thing and I don't know if you talk about that here or not, but like maybe just an ecom specific like if you have multiple brands, of course there's going to there's there's TAM for everything, right? There's like there's it's you can go in any bucket, but like do you think that if you went we going to take this one brand, our biggest brand, our number one brand that you were talking about earlier and just we want to take this to like 10 million a month. Like is that even feasible? Is that something that you guys are interested in? and then having egg because I hear all these things about exits in ecom and it's much easier obviously than something that's expertled and info or softwares or you know there's all these different things but like what is your thought on that versus having you know six port codes basically. Yeah. I mean, dude, if you asked me this question three months ago, I would have given you a complete different answer. Now, my my main thing is actually this one main brand that I'm trying to scale. I I spent the last threeish years, like two to three years, working on building a team. Like, I had to figure out how to lead people, how to attract talent, etc. And now, like, thank God, I've somewhat figured out at least I'm definitely nowhere near perfect, but I was able to develop a really good team that run a lot of these businesses without me having to go and do everything myself. Yeah. So, I literally spent like, well, I took two people on my team, for example. One of them I spent onboarding um every single day, 4 hours on Zoom for the first probably 3 months. And then he was like easily one of the best. He he was initially on media buying. He was one of the best media buyers like I've ever worked with within the first three months. Another guy, same exact name but for copy. And so initially it was just copy and then I added all the CMO stuff that went along with it. And now he's running our entire marketing team actually for two different companies. Yeah. So like I really did a lot of sacrifice initially to build these people up to be the leaders that they can be and have the skill sets that they need to have. Yeah. over the past few years that would not have been possible. Uh like I said, if you ask me even a few months ago, definitely not like a year ago. So thankfully they're at a position where they can run things for the most part themselves. And yeah, like I said, 90% of my time right now is going towards this this one brand and we're trying to exit for a very substantial figure like in the next few years. Nice. Okay. And that's yeah, that's the fun thing right now is like in my the sparkle in my eyes like okay this whole because I don't know I've read all the books or a lot of the books and all all the audles that are like what do they call it the the full circle of entrepreneurship is like when you can actually sell not you can just make a bunch of cash not you just cash flow something up and run an offer and then turn it off and like you made your money and yeah that's amazing like even that is hard for a lot of people to do but that full loop of like actually turning into a machine actually having something valuable actually having something that someone values that eight years or whatever of future that they're willing to pay for now is like just like a notch in the belt like or you know I think that is a cool thing to do. So that's what you're focus on now is you can is is that brand doing that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And then when you said you're doing still to this day though you're like in it writing ads and doing all that. You're doing that of that brand because you choose to like that's the one you're trying to like craft and master and then these other ones you have built team that manage it more so and you just overlook. Exactly. That's amazing. Yeah. I should have done that with tech and I didn't. And like I'm in a rock in a hard place. I have a senior tech dev that's like better than me at tech, but like I have a bigger understanding of the whole picture, you know, and like the understanding of like what it all touches and like you change this and it should change this or if we want to build the data around this, it's cuz we want to report on these versus these and like some of that stuff has not translated well and we're in this whole rebuild of like the entire data restructuring because we're trying to go to these large numbers that it really matters the storage of data. It's not as much like transactional at that point now. It's like it's internal data points. It's ascension numbers, but like at a real depth that tie to NPS scores that tied to, you know, like LTV numbers that come from different sources and know like the whole thing in one now that we're starting to get there cuz we just leaky bucket it for like the last 60. We're just like get a customer, cool, get another customer like hamster wheel it instead of worrying about like how can we make another 10 or 20 or whatever per person on the back and you need the data to do that. you need to know like all those things and I did not train team like that at all like our little that little department so like it's a whole reorg it's a whole restructure but yeah dude what so when I hired this CMO and maybe this will be helpful for you I don't know a lot of things you say are helpful for me so yes well well I think it would be interesting to tell you how I because I didn't really find these I kind of found them but I never created them the yeah yeah because so my copyriter is like the best example because when I hired him he was 19 years old. He was taking like a gap year from college and he had taken uh a few like copywriting courses and had maybe been in copyrightiting for like under a year. But I am like a huge believer if you're going for this person, it's going to be like an aggressive onboarding process. But if they show you that they are going above and beyond what they're told to do before you even hire them, to me that's a super super green flag. And I'm actually okay with taking somebody that has less experience but is a super duper culture fit and is very very growthminded that I know I can bring that person in. I can indoctrinate him on all of my beliefs on how to run marketing teams and systems. And that's exactly what I did. And that's why I spent so much time building him because it was that's what I was doing. I was like building his skill set and his his like way of thinking. and he's like the most teachable dude on the freaking planet, almost to a fault, which you wouldn't think is possible, but like he's he's really freaking good at that. And um the the story of me hiring him is actually freaking hilarious. So when I was hiring I was just hiring for a copywriter and I was like, "Okay, if I were to go back and I had to hire like the perfect copywriter, I would want somebody who can show me that they can write really good ads before I even bring them on to the offer. So what I did is I did like a few project group interviews and I found five people that were really really good really good. like some of them have written for mass like Agora like big big you know DL companies and I got them all in a Zoom room and my camera was off my mic was muted and they're all in there and the only thing that they can see is a screen of the Call of Duty goolog and it says the words the gauntlet and then in the background I'm playing Call of Duty music from like the zombies like the zombies and I don't say anything for like the first it. So, I just see like these people, you know, popping in the Zoom room and they're like looking at each other and they start laughing cuz they know they like the music. And then I I like unmute myself and I'm I'm like, "Welcome to the glet." And I start to explain the rules of how it works, which is basically, hey, we have this offer that's working. It was a low ticket offer at the time, and it's working really well. Your goal is to write an ad uh that beats our current control. If you be out of control, you'll be hired. If not, you won't be hired. And I've given them 24 hours to write this ad. And so, they can control the ad copy, the creative copy, um, they can control the like cinematography of how that ad is produced. They can control everything that they possibly want. Like, we have all the budget. They give us our own money to test this ad. And we actually did all of this. And some of them, we were filming, we were filming some of them, and we were like, "Holy cow, I don't even want to film this. This is so [ __ ] dog [ __ ] Like, it's terrible. I don't even want to continue this." And then others were really quite good. And the one that actually won was the guy that is now my my CMO. So nice. Yeah, it was it was a great product. So if you want to steal that for whatever. Yeah, somebody listening will want to steal that. I don't know if it works for my uh demo, but maybe. But that's so fun. Like you just have fun with it, which is hilarious. And I I mean I don't I'm definitely not the person and like let me drop the ego at the door that should be talking about how to hire, how to fire, you know, how to manage, how to do all that stuff. Like I in my little world of it has been very lean and then now it's more like of the of the sea level more or less right it's like doing that but then they have their teams and like I'm not boots on the ground I'm not dayto-day with anybody there so I very limited in that skill set but my thought on that and where I'm cuz that's like the Mr. thing, right? It's like have someone sit next to him for four years and then they became like his second brain for me and where we have now seen and we didn't do until recent, but hiring in people who have more experience than me because when you do that model, you're basically extracting everything from you and it's like they learn of course they can learn stuff outside, but the goal of that is that for them to sponge from you and become like as good as you and replace you. But my other like angle and view on that is like we brought a sales manager in who had done 3 million a month and we had never done 3 million a month and he came in and got us to 3 million a month. We then got stuck at 3 million a month and then went went down again and now we brought in a new sales manager that's done you know 100 a year and whatever else and it's like cool. We did the same thing with our CMO we just hired in first time like the sales manager was the first one. and the CMO has sold, you know, over 100,000 low tickets through one specific funnel, has an insane, you know, repertoire of clients and success stories, and he comes in and, you know, next thing you know, the entire ad account is gutted and rebuilt and structured and like we have multiple funnels that feed each other and all this stuff and it's like, oh, okay. So, like, yeah, you pay a little more, but him sitting next to me or whoever, right, in the marketing world, he's not going to learn how to do that. So, like there's that like back and forth of like hiring for someone who's already experienced and done it, which you need the P&L to support or or the comp model or something to support that, even if it's future growth they're tied to or whatever number because those guys are generally more expensive. But yeah, I mean, I probably should have done that. You're right with the with the tech and I don't maybe a Call of Duty lobby, but that's an interesting Yeah. model, especially for this cool like internet marketing lean thing. It just works. It works for like how where you play and you know like and with size. So, that's interesting. Yeah. And to be totally transparent, I'll probably never do that again. Um, if you want to try it, you do it. Yeah. Not not the remote thing. I'll do that again. But the uh that the training somebody and onboarding them so aggressively, like if it's if it's a really important position, I will onboard them as hard as I [ __ ] can. Yeah. And yeah, I I'll probably never do that again cuz our business looks completely different, you know? But there's definitely some benefits to having those people cuz those people will never leave. They'll never quit the company. They're super bought into the mission because of you. Yeah. And they're amazing employees to work with. So, it was a thing that's like it depends on the stage of business that you're in. For me, I was like, when I started that, I was like I was, you know, 22 years old. I was like, man, I got [ __ ] I'm already working myself to [ __ ] death. I may as well like figure out how to teach somebody how to do this. Yeah. So, it made sense for me at the time. I wouldn't do that again. I'll tell you right now. I would I would get sick of it very quickly. Yeah. 100%. All right. Next one. I thought this said workout routine protocol, but it says work routine. So maybe it's maybe it's both. Maybe both. But what is your what's your daily look like right now? And I'll preface that with I I just talked about this on one that I had yesterday or this morning or something. I don't know. I'm in a blur. But about how it's scattered as all can be, right? I'm like trying to do all these things at once. I'm a cog in a machine that I created and then became part of and now I'm just like existing in it. And I'm trying to like zoom out and I'm learning from, you know, people who crush it you as example and like how you guys segment these out. This is as much a selfish question as it is, you know, somebody else asked, but what is what's like the daily? So, typically, uh, you know, wake up and get to work as quickly as possible. You know, I don't I don't have a long morning routine. Um, just like caffeine, headphones, and get right into my most important work. And I try to ask myself the night before, like really, the morning routine starts the night before when you're planning out your day and your priorities and what you want to get done. And I'm trying to ask myself like what is the, you know, the one thing question, right? like what is the one thing such that by doing it everything else becomes easier or unnecessary. I'm like what is the one thing that I can do such that by doing it um it would apply the most leverage to the business and for me knowing what I'm good at it would be like writing ads building funnels or tweaking existing funnels because I can make one tweak that like reduces our CPA by like 20%. And that makes the business 20% more profitable. Yeah. Like that's that's crazy. It's a needle mover. Yeah. It's it's one of the biggest news especially for e-commerce because we're so uh paid acquisition dependent. So it's not like we have like a YouTube channel. We're getting all this organic traffic. You know, we have like we have SEO, we have Tik Tok shop, but we're very dependent on paid ads. Like thankfully we have a lot of platforms that we run on. But if I'm able to reduce the CPA significantly, then I want to spend all my time doing that. So it's usually like waking up and getting ready to work on writing new ads, uh new VSSLs. I still do write VSSLs with AI of course, but I still do like writing all my VSSLs, especially upsell VSSLs because I I love writing them. And um I usually try to not schedule any meetings in the morning. So like I don't want to do any meetings unless it's after like 1 or 2 p.m. because I like to work for anywhere from like 3 to 4 hours in the morning completely undistracted. Like I'll even close Slack a lot of times and see how much actual impactful work that I can get done. Yeah. and then I'm going to go to the gym because I'm [ __ ] brain fried. And if your deep work is really that deep, like that's a good indicator if your deep work is actually deep work. Like, do you feel cognitively exhausted by the time that deep work is over? If the answer is no, that wasn't actually deep work. You were just undistracted. Like, very, very big difference. So, yeah. Yeah, 100%. I mean it's yeah I I see a lot of your videos and I I'd love to deep dive some of that because you go into like you go into a lot of those scope and I know those are kind of like your broader stuff that then brings in but like it's an interesting topic. I I've I've been in the everything has to be perfectly to a tea within x minute and tried that whole game and I've like completely faded away from that and been like I just have conversations and decisions all day and like that's kind of fun sometimes and then my my honeypot is like my 5 a.m. cuz no one's on is the is the real reason, right? It's like you're fresh, you're doing your thing, and nobody's messaging you. And it's like even if you want to pop on Slack, there's no one responding. So like I'll like blast stuff out. I'll do data reports. I'll be like, "Oh, this is interesting." Like ascension rate change from this to this across this because we did this and like drop these things in chats and like do that. But as soon as everyone wakes up, I am a addict. I am on I've got email on one tab. I've got this. I'm refreshing here. I've got I'm like answering this Slack that goes until 9:00 p.m. because someone's on PST. I'm on Slack on my phone. I'm doing that. Like I am I I'm the guy who responds in 30 seconds anywhere. I see someone typing and I like joke and I'm like type type like it's too I'm like too in it too in it. And over the last like month or so especially with then you add YouTube and access and all these things. I like zoom out a little bit and I'm like breathe and just like look at the machine right now because when I'm in it like that I just can't see beh like here. Yeah. And it hurts. It hurts. it like it hurts everywhere because you just not I'll be like working on a thing and I'll be like working on chart and then I'll answer this and I'll go back to here and I'll be like don't I'm like oh the chart and I'll go back and I'm like like that's not healthy either at all obviously but like as soon as I live too high in the clouds and I'm just making decisions and just having meetings I like feel like I'm not accomplishing things because I'm not building and doing the deep work but like sometimes the deep work is like very low level and it's like am I just busy to busy versus some high leverage build and like deep work. So, it's just constantly that game of like trying to net for me, trying to navigate that. But, it's hard for me. Very hard. That's very very similar actually to to me as well because I I'll tell you the true story. So, I have uh I just started like running a new um ad account myself cuz I one thing about I really actually enjoy getting my hands dirty. I know it's like not always the best use of my time, but I just like [ __ ] love it. And if I'm launching something new, I won't like I'm obsessively controlling every single element of it. Yeah. and we were scaling up this ad account and um I have uh some need buyers that are based in they're Durban but I believe they're based in you know who they are. Yeah, but um I think they're Yeah, it's $200 a month freaking 4,000 foot apartment. Yeah, exactly. He's somewhere in Europe. I don't think he's maybe he's in Maltto right now. Anyways, always. Yeah. Um, I was like really really adamant about getting this new launch done. And by the time I figured out that it needed to be launched for the next day or my time, it was like, you know, 8:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m. And I had a lot of work to do. So I stayed up until probably like 2 or 3 just cuz I'm, you know, really kind of in this this phase right now. And I was like, [ __ ] they're still not up. All right, I'm going to have to go to bed momentarily and then I need to have a call with them to make sure that we get the [ __ ] done and saying I literally set my alarm for like 2 hours and I fell asleep for 2 hours with my laptop and woke up and immediately had a call to like explain these new launches that we had to do. But dude, that day ended up being like the most profitable day that we'd ever had. And if I didn't actually have that level of obsessiveness, Yeah. then we would not have gotten those results. So, I'm all for like I'm kind of all for like the biohacking, productivity maxing, all that [ __ ] But sometimes, man, you just got to be a [ __ ] dog. You just got to like break all the rules. Like, [ __ ] sleep. Like, just [ __ ] get the [ __ ] done no matter what. I can't be like, "Oh, I can't have like caffeine at this late in the day. My my website is going to go down. [ __ ] get the [ __ ] work done, bro. Just like by any means." Yeah. We launched uh we moved hosting and moved to web flow and we're like oh when's our lowest day we turn off ads for Christmas Eve, Christmas day, like whatever call funnel, right? So no one's going to be taking calls. We just turn off ads. We turn it off for like two or three days prior and I'm like today's the day. Like let's toggle this. Let's full move the entire site and it had all the funnels on it too. So it's not like this was like some light transition. This was every funnel page, every email automation, every everything was about to get impacted by this. and we toggled it over and my lack of pro proactiveness on this. It was like Laura Mipsum on everything that was front-facing except all the core pages. So like the funnel pages were built like everything was duped over correctly kind of like there was like link integration issues and we toggled this thing at like 6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve or on Christmas night and I just literally sat here for like eight hours and just went link by link. I threw a 404 script on something and just watched clarity real time and just refresh like just had it sitting on this screen and I was like grabbing a URL. Oh, the redirects. Oh my god, there was I I think I ended up with 270 something redirects I had to build. Oh, and like wild cards and all this stuff and I'm just sitting here and like let's just say, you know, personal life, all that was not, you know, it wasn't good. It wasn't good. I had other plans I had made. I had like agreed to all this stuff and I because I wasn't proactive about it had to like I had to do it. I had to do it and everyone else was off and the other co-founders like on messaging me like you need help. I'm like, "No, you can't help me. Like, I did this to myself. I did this to myself. I didn't audit all this. I thought the copywriters were going to have this to me in time. I thought they did. I didn't manage the project well. Just like I take 100% blame for this, but like I got to fix it now." And like too many times of that have Yeah. It's like it's not fun. It's not fun sometimes, but like Yeah. That's just entrepreneurship sometimes though, man. Like you make mistakes, you [ __ ] up, and then you just got to pay the price. Yeah. No, no, 100%. Um All right. Well, we didn't even talk workout routines. What the heck? Everyone do that for real? Yeah, hit it. Okay. Um, so I train every single day. Um, like lifting. I don't take any days off. My day off is considered arms because it's like it's two of the tiniest muscles in your body and like I don't really give a [ __ ] Um, and who doesn't want bigger arms? So, and it's actually fun. Me and my buddy that's he's also like a guy that works with me. Um, we're like super into the gym and we train together maybe like three times a week and we just can't stand the [ __ ] [ __ ] about like all this science-based lifting [ __ ] pathetic ass [ __ ] because there's all these guys that are so incredibly small trying to give advice to you on like how to lift and how it's not optimal. So, that shifted my philosophy and I'm now going back to like training like a meatthead and just training hard as I [ __ ] can every single day. I try to recover pretty hard too. So, like I train hard, recover hard. Um, my split, for those that are wondering, it's it's very very simple. It's basically an eight day split because I lift every single day. I can get more I can still hit every muscle group twice a week except for one. So, it's like one extra day. So, I do typically uh chest and shoulders, back, arms, legs, and I just repeat that every four days. So, it's like a 4 day split that I repeat in perpetuity. And aside from that, I train like kickboxing like once or twice a week for for cardio, basketball maybe once a week. So, I'm pretty active, but the gym is like uh mental therapy more than physical therapy. So, that's really the main reason that I go. Yeah. When do you find when do you go? Yeah. Well, yeah. Like, you know, some of these guys are like, "Oh, my 4 a.m." And you you said you start work then and then like when you're drained, you hit it. So, like midafter afternoon you go and then pop back or Yeah. Usually around like 11:00 a.m. Um I'll be back by like 1:00 at the absolute latest and I'll be good for the rest of the day. Yeah, that's how I try and do them. Like we have meetings now that are 10 to 12 basically. So like I'll either go at 12 because I cannot go in the morning. It's just not going to happen. So like I'll end up at 12 to 1ish. I'll end up there. But every single day I go. And the big one for me and I'm very curious. How do you do the eating? How do you I mean do you have do you door dash your life away? Do you have meal prep city? Like it's a big thing. You know some people pay for a chef. Some people like I can't eat enough because I don't plan ahead and I've done the meals and then I've gotten bored of them. I've done this. I've had people, you know, who've make things that, you know, in my house, you know, like I've done that. But what do you do? I'm always testing. So, what I'm doing right now is is gas station meets. Yeah. I just have uh beef jerky like beef jerky on a tube that just hangs down. Yeah. No, I just uh I'm getting like pre uh pre-made meals. So, like meal prep meals basically. There's there's a place literally like within a block of me that makes uh pre-made food specifically for like bodybuilders. So, it's like perfect for me. And right now I'm having that along with that's actually mostly it like you know basic protein shakes. But I I mostly have those meals like religiously right now. And uh it's kind of like I'm in a slight like cut phase right now. That's why I said it kind of depends on like the phase. Um, if it was standard though, I'm a very avid added door dasher and I know I should probably like hire a a chef and I haven't. So, yeah, [ __ ] it. I don't I don't really care. So, for the most part, if like if I'm getting my protein in, um, then I'll I'll kind of follow that structure with that. Let's just like get enough protein back fill with whatever else you want and just don't eat like a a fat [ __ ] and you should be good. Yeah. In PR, I literally used the grocery store as my fridge and like I'd go to the gym and then on the way out of the gym, I could like, you know, underhand toss a rock to where the grocery entry was. So, I'd walk in there, I'd get two pounds of ground beef and like Lacroy or whatever and then something to some sauce to put on it. And I literally every day would eat like two, three pounds of ground beef and I would just cook it right when I got home and that was it. And I would just eat that every single day. And that was like the biggest probably. Then I got back here where they actually have meal delivery, you know, and like mainland vibes. And I did that and then just like a big dinner every night and just doing the same thing. But when I stop doing that, it's like art three RTDs a day of just like grabbing shakes out of the thing trying not to do all these hormone ones and like it it just becomes it I can't think about it. It drives me crazy and then I just don't eat because if I had to think about it too much, I'm just like I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this today. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, the the biggest thing with with eating is like what is going to cause me the most uh I'm sorry, the least amount of like decision fatigue literally because you especially I I feel like we sound so stupid saying this, but like it's real. Like it's very real. It's absolutely real. And that's why I mean you you usually just I think see me with my shirt off, but if you see me like walking around in my actual city, I would wear the same [ __ ] clothes every single day. I don't have any sense of fashion. I wear one more ad shirts and like basic pants and like sneakers and that's it. And I wear it every single day. Yeah. If I have a shirt on, it's just one more answer. Other than that, it's mostly shirtless. Yeah. I No, I literally could not I mean, people comment, they're like, "Oh, the hoodie in there." And it's like when I'm sitting at this desk, I'll throw like a random hoodie on or something. If I leave this house, it's in this black t-shirt. I'm pretty sure I have not worn another black anything but a black t-shirt out in public in like years. Yeah. And to me, that's to me, we're winning. Like, I don't know if I I'm telling you, this feels so stupid to say, but like it is real. It's like I I just I can't I don't have that sense. I don't understand it. I don't want to understand it. I don't care. Like, it works with everything. It's easy. I just have, you know, 10 of them from cuts every like six months and I just refresh them and call it a day and just like that's life. Yeah, man. That simplicity of scales like like [ __ ] everything else. So, yeah, 100%. All right, so let's get a little meta here. So, someone asked uh how he puts out content and the differences. Well, this is kind of branded, unbranded. This is about ecom, but let's talk about your content specific. So, like what is what's the methodology? like you've you've you and I have talked about this a bit and I don't know how in-d depth or not but like zooming out like what is the approach you do stuff that you know you own keyword you know we've kind of talked about and you focus on there you do stuff that's a little maybe broader around you know the dopamine resets like I assume those are probably broader but still reach a version of the same audience like what's your what's the strategy there to me the like what you talk about is a lot less important than who you are so I We talked about this before, but when I was beginning like starting to put out content on YouTube, I I was just upset. I was just pissed off about all the [ __ ] out there. So, I was like, if I were to literally make like a T-chart and have all the [ __ ] on the lefth hand side, where would be the opposite of all this? So, like perfect example, it was like extremely polished thumbnails when it comes to like YouTube videos. I was like, perfect, I'm going to do the exact opposite. I will create thumbnails. Yeah. And then it said super SEO hyper optimized keyword titles. My top video I think on the entire channel is called like how to make [ __ ] you money. And then the only real keyword is branded drop shipping. Like that's it. Yeah. And I literally have I have videos that say like I'm [ __ ] [ __ ] I have videos that say like uh the mad version of Only Fans. That was a good one. That one I got that one got some clicks. I I'm trying to see how many of these quote unquote rules I can break and still win. That's really my philosophy and that's that's like my life [ __ ] philosophy to be honest. That's that's what's at the heart of everything that I do, every piece of content that I make. Um, I try to do like a 2 to1 ratio of like e-commerce videos to uh more like mindset, entrepreneurship, general stuff because I want to impact a good amount of people and when you zoom out 30,000 feet, drop shipping is very small. Yeah. And I still want to get more people to like kind of know who I am. And I again at the center of everything is just like I want to provide as much value as possible in kind of a unique way that most people never hear. And I think that's why I've developed the audience that I have is cuz I like say things that they know to be true, but I'm saying it in a way that they never heard before. And yeah, that's that's basically like my my philosophy in a nutshell. Yeah. No, I mean they crush. And that was a quick come up, right? Like you Yeah. Yeah. I I start within um November, so pretty quick. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I watch all of them. I'm like, "Okay, cool. I have uh I have an opportunity to just do it raw and just share like that." I don't have as much ideation and packaging which is very clearly the uh one of the main issues and like the the market and the target and what I'm talking about is also much different but yeah I mean I look at all your stuff and I'm like oh I wish I could like do that and I don't want to zoom out too far and I also feel like this huge like um I don't say imposter syndrome is the right word but like a lot of that stuff is stuff I'm interested in but stop not stuff I feel like comfortable like at some level like almost teaching or like educating on. That's why a lot of stuff is like here's what's what we're doing now, not even what's working now or like here's what worked in the past and not like oh this is the protocol or like these are the best books and because I don't know like I don't know what someone's goal is or where they're at or what they're already at in schedule and like I don't know I just feel like almost unqualified sometimes talk about that stuff where I think you do a good job of how because I think how your content is um comes across is like very like this is my opinion or this is how I did it in a good way but like also in a way that's like but you should too because it worked. And like I think that is unique and something I don't really like grasp in mind. And I'm like, I don't know, run whatever one of these funnels works for you. who are like, "Yeah, like this one generally speaking does this or like has for us, but I know guys who crush this funnel or like team structure wise, I know guy or great one is like I know guys who run 60% margins at scale and do three or four million a month and like we don't do that and like if your goal is profit and doing this or if your goal is this or this like it's just every it's it's all contextual and it's very hard for me to like try and share something other than here's what we're doing or here's my current frame on this and because everyone's is different. Everyone's goal is different. Everyone's current situation is different. Everyone can approach it in a different way. How one person does ads versus someone does ads is like night and day. Like all of those things. That's very true. I I can help you with those though. Like how long have you been in the game? In what game? Internet marketing. 10 probably, which is still like a baby, but like I mean I was probably I was 18 I think when I bought my first course. So, I bought a course for $500 in the webinar funnel or and I think I was I think I went through the replay actually on webinar jam and I bought an Instagram shoutout course that taught how to create things on Canva or whatever it was at the time. I think it was Canva. Make a graphic that was pay for a link in bio, pay these guys to do shoutouts for 200 bucks or whatever. Link in bio is going to be your opt-in page and when they opt in your uh your thank you page redirect is to uh ClickBank link. So, you liquidate that. So, you liquidate the cost just by getting a couple sales on the back end for your $200 thing and you call it a day and then you own this email list for free and then you just mail it whatever day basically and then you every third or fourth you drip in an affiliate thing and I was like 18 years old had just failed all this like big business stuff I was trying to do and be like a hot shot tail between my legs headed home and like I just didn't want to email the list. I didn't know how and I didn't have the wherewithal to know I could pay a copyrighter or somebody to mail the list and take a percentage. Like I had just I just didn't understand. So I got that list to like 25 G's like fully selfquidated and like 25,000 people not 25 grand and 25,000 people on the list and I just couldn't figure out I just didn't have it in me to like mail them and like pretend to be somebody and like I didn't understand the game. Like I didn't understand the game. But yeah, that was 10 years ago. Okay. So 10 years ago. Okay. So one of the ways that helped me get over imposter syndrome because I I I feel the same way. I like humility is at the center of everything that I do uh at all times and there's people that are so like just so many light years ahead of me. I always try to like remain cognizant of that. You're I'm I'm a very very small fish. Um and the the thing that helped me get past that when I started making content, man, was there are people out there that have like such a tiny fraction of the wealth of knowledge that you do that are spreading information that probably is just [ __ ] terrible. Yeah. And it's your like duty as somebody who's been in the game for so for 10 years so seriously to actually put out good quality information. Like it's your civil duty as a member of this [ __ ] game, the internet marketing game to actually put out good info. And if you don't, you're actually doing a disservice to everybody because you have this wealth of knowledge and then there's these [ __ ] kids that are 16 years old posting videos about [ __ ] and they haven't lived any [ __ ] life in the game. Yeah. No, I mean I don't I don't disagree and like I I am ne I mean I don't want to say never but like it is nowhere on the radar to like package it or sell it or anything and like just staying in this frame I feel pretty good with. I just try and like I feel like every like fifth or seventh or whatever video I'm like hey by the way just a reminder for anyone new here like this is no ego. This is no fluff. I'm not telling you what to do. I'm giving you my opinion. Like I try and do that which is like not good for YouTube for the first viewer, not good for any of these things. But I'm like I just I don't know. there's whatever limiting belief around that that's like I need to preface with this because to just tell someone what to do or someone blindly following or who's on their fourth internet marketing video to come upon this and be like oh this is how I do it. It's like bro there's so like just watch these videos for weeks and just try stuff and just iterate and iterate is what someone needs to do more so than just like oh perfect I need to run a call funnel. It's like you don't know you have no idea. So all right what else we got on here? Um, people are there's multiple two different people asked about branded versus unbranded. So, what does that mean when they're talking ecom? It's kind of what I was talking to you about at the beginning. So, like branded drop shipping versus unbranded drop shipping. Yeah. So, it's just it's just not throwing a brand on it. As simple as that. To me, the definition is not having the intention of building a good brand and just using it as like this kind of loophole get-richqu uh make money online thing. Cuz I think there's two different things. Like if if you started from day one and you're like I want to build a business. I want to build a brand that's going to like I think the biggest indicator is like the timeline because if you're like I I need to make 10K a month. Like 10K month, 10K a month, 10K month. Then it's like, all right, I know exactly how you're thinking now. You're not thinking like a business owner. You're thinking of a guy that wants to make money online. That's going to result in the worst relationship with your customers. You're probably going to have terrible uh results in the first place cuz you're so attached to the money. And then like then we get into like the spirituality side of that as well and like law of attraction of you thinking those thoughts. Like you're so much less likely to actually have that happen if that's the way that you're thinking. And then branded drop shipping is the exact opposite. You start at day one. You're like my goal is to create a like sustainable business that is, you know, there's going to be a lot of ups and downs, but I want to eventually grow this into something that make me a lot of money and have the potential to exit instead of like a get-richqu scheme. Yeah. What are margins like on those things? Like what would a target be for someone who is starting up? Is that like a 30% gain or is it less? Yeah, I would say 30% is like a good target to shoot for when you're starting. Super difficult. Yeah. And do you guys do like on actual fulfillment just get in the weeds a little bit like I talked to uh Brooke Hiddink on here and he does info and stuff around this, but he teaches the basically like US supply like high ticket drop shipping more. And I think that he's going to kill me for saying it like that, but you know that's I think that's that's my quick version of it. But like so you guys how does all that what everything just happened and you know tariffs and timing of shipping and all that like does that crush these things in I mean in branded I guess if you get to the point where you have inventory and you have 3L's and stuff but like that inbetweener that beginner stage like are you just getting waxed? So a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. Like the tariffs are a thing and like people people do have to pay them and we we pay them because we have part of our manufacturing still in China cuz we're like we're developing new products. We're extending our product line. So we still have some manufacturing and in uh you know shipments coming from China. Majority is in the US, but we do have some in China. Oh, really? Yeah. that the the cool thing is like even if you're super super against tariffs, you can still easily easily easily drop ship within the United States only. It's not like the most difficult [ __ ] thing on the planet. You just have to know where to look and how to communicate with these guys. It's not like it's impossible. Like if you're trying to source a hyper hyper unique product, then yeah, you're probably only going to find that in China. But if you find a product that is uh that is like what I call it prevalidated, like there's already uh pretty big competitors selling this product at scale, then chances are they already have some manufacturing in the United States and you can just figure out how to find their supplier and use them. And there's a lot of services to do that. But that's yeah, it's definitely possible. If you're like super against selling uh anything out of China, period, because of tariffs, cool, just do it in the US. It's not the [ __ ] end of the world. I've heard you talk about this and I'm just going to pick your brain now, but you you've talked about the saturated versus not. I have my very limited most recent experience of this. Like I have years prior where I did this when it was a completely different game and like just messed around with it and whatever 5k days and doing this then I lose it or I drop an ad account or something and I go back to my normal life and like just did it for fun. Like this most recent time, how are you finding something that makes sense costwise in the States? Like because that was the biggest thing is like if I popped on one of these like one of the tools and I guess maybe that's the simplest difference right there. It's just like I'm using one of these tools like they're US-based ones. It's like I have no room for anything and then I do I have funny story is the biggest competitor cuz I was not trying to rip something that was like completely fat. Like I was trying to I saw somebody else running it. They clearly were spending into it and I was like okay cool. We can get a little chunk of it and I built it around but they were using advertorials. I didn't want to build an advertorial because I thought it was stupid and I thought it was just an extra step and I was very shortsighted and was doing my thing and it was like breaking even. I was like, "Oh, if I can just optimize a little, then I get my 20% and just call it a day and just have fun with this." And we were just trying to build the brand around it. I was going to buy a domain and then I was going to actually build a company. And then I just like got bored and was doing something else. And actually what really happened is we started to lean back into this and I was like, "Oh, this makes more sense." But how do you get the cost down? Is it just having your agent your like you said your relationships? So partially but part part of it is also in like your story itself because when you're like all right costs are going to be higher than United States. That's pretty much a universal rule. Yes, there is going to be some truth to that. For me the question the the the thought process is not [ __ ] I need to like go source from China now and just deal with the tariffs. It's how can I control the perception of value around this product so that it's higher and I can still justify selling at this uh this higher cost of goods sold. And that's why that competitor is probably running with a service and he was working with it and you ran straight tag at PDP or whatever and didn't make it work. Yeah, I was rocking I I mean I'll I'll dox it. It's hilarious. I we initially started with uh it was all dog stuff but it was like uh uh one of that that like duck toy thing. People were doing that for a minute like the yellow one and dogs can only see yellow and like it's their comfort animal because of that. And then this other one was like this back seat thing like there was five different variations of that were popping off that were like the back seat protector and then there was different styles and like luxury ones and upgrades and all this stuff and these guy I mean it was 60 bucks or something like that delivered and then they're break you know. Yeah. So it was it was an interesting game but we were having fun with it. We were selling for like 120 bucks. People were selling for 200. People were selling for72. I'm like I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here. Like I don't get this game. I'm not seasoned. Well, part part of the thing with advators and probably why those guys were working with it is because you can control like the perception of value a lot more. If you send straight to like a PDP and they're immediately price aware like immediately as they see the product, they know the price. Yeah. I don't I don't want to do that. If it's something like this where I need to be competitive and be able to sell for a higher price point, I want to build up like the story. I want to build up all these foundational copy elements that show why this product is actually worth so much more than all the competitors, right? I'm going to build when you say it like that, but at the moment I was like, "Oh, it's just another software, another page I have to build." Just sounds painful. It just sounds boring. It means more work for sure, but it's it's but it pays. Yeah. Okay. So then what's the I hear you talk about it. And what's the difference saturated and unsaturated? I hear you talk about that all the time. Or like like you use that and then you use another phrase. What's your other one? It's like you have saturated products and unsaturated products and everyone thinks they need this one but you're saying the better pockets here and then your other one you just said it was uh like validated. Yes, validated. Same thing. Yeah. So I I think every product kind of exists on on the spectrum and you have obviously like the most competitive products of all time where there's let's just say like a thousand competitors selling one particular product all over the world and then you have on the other side of the spectrum products that nobody has ever sold ever. Yeah. And I have been at both sides. I have been the guy that is like the first one to see an AliExpress listing back in the day and I'll just run some basic image ads and test it and sometimes it kind of worked like the scale was always limited but it would kind of work and I I think the best way to go about it is to like if this is a spectrum and like this is super super saturated it's to go right about there. So, not to the point where it's like um uh let's see if I can like think of a good example like posture corrector probably because there's just such a massive drop shipping product. Y and it's literally been [ __ ] ran through like [ __ ] crazy. But I would find something that I can prove has at least one competitor that's doing a good amount of volume. Yeah. So, honestly, even if it was a posture corrector, if I could find a competitor that is relatively new, not one that's been around forever because they have all this momentum, all the data, the pixel, etc., But if I found a new guy that was selling this product maybe with like some sort of unique angle that hasn't been sold to before and he was able to scale up to let's just say like $300,000 a month, I'm like, "Okay, that would obviously be validation for me to go sell that product." So I'm looking for at least one successful competitor that is selling the product at scale and I I quantify scale in this particular case is like around 300k per month. Yeah. Interesting. because I know if there's somebody else out there selling this product at 300k per month, if I take a little little look see and go through their whole brand and go through the creatives, everything that I can possibly find on them, odds are I can find one thing that I can compete with them on, one thing that they're not doing well enough that I could destroy with. Yeah. So, for example, maybe they're running all their traffic to like uh static images and this is a product that could be sold with VSSL. I'll be like, perfect. There's my competitive advantage right there. they're running all the traffic to a PDP. I'm like perfect, I can run funnels. So that that's like my thought process when I'm looking at it. That's why the I think I actually did talk about this in the male Only Fans video, but I was like you have to find out what you are going to compete on with this one competitor because if you rip everything that they're doing onetoone, you may have a little bit of money in the short term. You'll definitely get like DMC8. You'll you'll probably get a lot of [ __ ] shut down. It's not a good way to go about it. But what is like one tiny little thing that you can tweak to just destroy it? I mean, another good example is like, you know, how big the the Primal Foods and like Primal [ __ ] everything has become over the past few years, but it was very very clearly mostly selling to men. And so you have like a brand that pops up and they start selling all these like supplement products that are like Primal to women. And now you have this company called Prime Queen, which is like a massively successful DTOC brand, just because they found this one unique angle, this one specific subsection of the market to market to. So that's like that's what I'm looking at. I'm like, I'm trying to find these successful competitors. Uh what is one thing that I can beat them on and go all in on that as hard as I possibly can. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys are great. We That's so funny you say that. We met them at that same event I was talking about where we went to uh and the whole team went. We I've known those guys before. They had other companies prior and they're down there and they're like talking about how they're going to launch this thing and that was like a couple years ago or Yeah. Yeah. Less probably. They're killing it, man. They're they are killing it still. They are killing it. Yeah. Those guys are those guys are G's. Um Okay. So, speaking of kind of that and I was just refreshing and Shackleford just liked the that we're live and that makes me think. So, what is your view on something like that? like a Brez, a Primal or whatever, like a from the ground up, like a full front end, not finding competitors, finding something because that's not necessarily finding something that's like new on AliExpress, right? Like you're not like, you know, there's that game which is like find something saturated that's in drop shipping, find something that's like new to drop shipping. And then there's like full-on ideiation creation of Brez, of Primal Queen, where you find this thing that maybe already exists, but like you do it in a better way. You can I mean, there's a million in one examples. There's the brick thing on the phone. there's the you know what's your thought on that? Like do you guys have any interest in doing stuff like that? We have we have something similar in one of our main brands. We we did start um pretty early like branding branding the product. Um and now it's like it's we have like our own custom like one one is a beauty product like we have our own custom formulations for everything for example like we've we've worked with uh scientists to to do research like every every ingredient has been clinically researched etc. But I'm overall a massive fan of that for people that have the capital to invest in it because I think if you ask a lot of these guys that went straight to a route like that, it took some capital to start up. Especially a beverage company. I don't know how much uh Shackler dumped in there, but especially beverage company. They typically won for Yeah, this is this is a this is a pro them. I literally had one last night except and like they they're crush like I think those guys are so cool and like what they like how they do their public stuff. I don't know if you I think it's on LinkedIn where he posts most of it, I think. But I've seen they do like their month overmonth like here's where you know distribution. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's badass to me. Like that build in public version of it I think is cool. Obviously I'm doing it. But like I love it too. I've been following um uh Shackleford when he started Brez like since since before he even launched like his first official product like for a long time. Yeah. So I I personally love that. And the the way that I think about this is is back to like the competitive advantages like what are you competing on? So if you go farther and farther down like the spectrum, I have things that like are most difficult to compete on and most uh easy to compete on. And one of the most difficult but the most profitable ones is competing on the product itself. If you create your own category, then everything else downstream becomes easier. The the ads become easier, the funnel becomes easier. Like from a marketing perspective, it's so much easier in every single way. Yeah. Product wise, yeah, it's a pain in the ass. you got to go through everything to to build the product to make sure it's like safe for people to use, etc. But in terms of like the competitive advantages and building a moat, dude, that's like that's by far one of the best ways that you can you can do that. Yeah, 100%. What is the I mean, this is something we're interested in doing, but not yet obviously because I want to focus on the info and the coaching and like stay in that lane for a while and get it up to size, but we are interested in doing that. What do you what is capital to do something like that roughly? Is it 50? Is it 200? Is it five? You know, like to start something like that and obviously different. You said beverages and like minimum order quantity and like, you know, formulation. I have no idea. 50 grand. Is it 250? I would say you start at 50. Yeah. It really does depend depending on the category. Like I don't like Shaq probably did a lot more than 50, but I would say 50 is like a good starting point. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah, cuz like I said, I think we're going to start with the in-house stuff, but brand is so important to us and quality is so important to us and that's why we always are like trying the different ones and like we barely talk about stuff cuz it's like you never know that supplement space is just so unregulated. Yeah. Is that we're going to do a supplement route? We'll go we'll we'll get there. I I would just I mean it's just the natural evolution I would assume. I'm not you know claiming anything or doing anything but I mean it's just the we did we tried with the partnership. I think I've told this story so many times, but like this is just a simple example of like where my awareness was or like my understanding of like econ like that and this was a year ago and like how far it's come. We literally agreed to do because you know all these guys that do you know uh like a 10x or whatever they do the test kit, right? They sell a test kit, they buy it, get shipped to your house, you pee on it, you put it in your whatever you do, you know, hopefully not both those. And then you send it back and then they basically, you know, get you on a call and talk about here are the great things, here are the bad things, here are the supplements to fill those bad things, more or less. You buy them, subscription game. Cool. We did a partnership. They're great, great company, great everything, great products. That was a huge thing. We did like all this vetting around it, but we bolted it on post purchase. So basically, we were paying for the kit. So there goes the 200 bucks or 4 whatever the number was around there. So you got your ads, your sales rep, your coach, and then you're also paying for this, which is like like look at it like a welcome kit. You know, people send like, you know, a hoodie and a this and a that. It was like that was our kind of like thought behind it. It was a version like that, but it was just directly part of the like the product. Send them off. I look at the stats after however many months. And again, I wasn't close enough to it. I didn't have clear stats. There was total issues with like clarity around stats. I literally had it connected to the terms that the second they submitted their stuff, it shot into a sheet and we got build. So it's like we're real time cash flowing this thing and there just money's flying out and we're doing so much new that I'm like not even looking at it and they are responsible full partnership to they get the kit. They're supposed to then take it and then send it back and then get on a call with the person and then buy the supplement and then we're going to get lifetime subscription rev at like you know 40 50% partnership and call it a day. I'm like perfect. We don't have to deal with supplements. We're good. I get the stats after however long and like half the people were even sending the test kit in. So there goes, you know, I don't even want to talk about that. Like however many hundreds of thousands of dollars just like literally burned. Literally on fire because they didn't even send it back. Then of the people that sent it back, like whatever it was, 70% show rates. Classic callfunnel. 70% show rates. So there goes another 30% of those burned. Like just never got on the call to talk about their test results. And then the close rate of those people is like 20%. Which makes sense. All of this makes so much sense if you just look at it. And it's like our adherence to making sure the clients did it, the clients doing it, the partner company, you know, enforcing it like all or like having some recourse. Like anything, every piece of it was broken to the point that pops out the end and it's like we're making like 20 bucks on average on subscription and it's like 250 and like the average is this. Like we're losing 90% of it across the board and we're a million into spend and a million into kits. Oh my god. Like dude, it was just such a f and again the company all good. Like I there's no that's not I'm not blaming them. I'm not anything. Like it was just how we approached the partnership model. How the math looked and how I just didn't even do the math well enough or the understanding of like can we get this test kit for 50 or like can you float us this and then do it from this or like do something like there was there was a deal to be made or a structure that could have worked but they're not very direct response. So, they're not like a Cardone where you would have partnered with them and they would have been like 90 dials and like GMing you through the system. They were more brand and quality focused and like again great company, no [ __ ] on them, but like just the math so hard. So, just like burned it, turned it off, removed it from the offerings, removed it from the stack. We like kind of recommend some stuff out, but we just we're just going to sit on it until we're in a place where we can control the chain because we're also talking like enterprise value over time and like what else can we build into the true model, not just like where can we make more cash cuz we could just do that again the right way and make you know 40% on it or whatever number. Or we can control the whole thing. have the bulk amounts, have this include it in the phone sales process, have like we got to get big on info first to where it makes sense to have this like massive org, but it's there and the guys who do it do it. That's a crazy [ __ ] story. You mentioned something interesting there. Uh just two words, enterprise value. So, are you what is your vision of the future? Like you you guys are going all in on on info right now, but I'm sure it's a lot bigger than that for enterprise value purposes. Yeah, I mean I just Yeah, like I just said it was whatever nine months ago it was like should we just make this a cash flow thing and like we're just going to make it a cash flow thing and then it changed over and I think it was the belief shatter was one of them. It was like the idea of what it could be was just small and then we made some friends, got some connects and we're like, "Oh, wait. This person basically runs the same thing or this person runs a similar thing and that guy's doing 12 a month. That guy's doing 20." Like what? like these really large numbers that at the time we were doing two to three a month maybe and doing okay for ourselves for sure but then acquisition broke then all this stuff and it's like this kind of just this like sucks right now and then it turned in the direction when I say you know enterprise value like yeah I know about seven things and there's probably 70 things I don't know about that and I the core things I do know or the things I've learned for from Hormosi and then gone down my own rabbit holes and like especially in the info coaching world like what's important for that and how to, you know, reduce founder risk and how to clean things in XYZ department and how to make a machine and how to have the team stack and like I've definitely learned some things. Um, and again, I'm sure there's 70 on the radar that I have no idea about. But it's doable. There's no doubt in my mind, especially like in our market, in our space, it's a doable thing. Just has to be built correctly. And 0.001% of info coaching sell. I understand that. But like I bet of the people that actually try to do it and go in the direction of getting it to the point of doing it, it's a higher hit rate. I promise you it is. Yeah. I think I think you're probably right about that. And and if you're building from intention from the start, then you know kind of what you need to do. I went to uh well I went to one of our like inerson workshops and we joined like his mastermind thing and so we got we got a lot more in-depth stuff around that but there was a guy that literally literally told us we had like uh yeah I won't say the business name but we had a business that we were working on. One of the or nerves team members just like yeah we don't [ __ ] want this thing. We're like what do you mean really don't want it? It was such a shock to us. We're like but look at look at the numbers. Look at the profit. Like we're like what do you mean you don't want it? So it was uh it was an eye opening experience. Like we literally didn't know that that was a thing that could happen. And we even had like we had a software company as well and we're like we're trying to position that for uh right now just just like for growth but we brought that in the picture too. And it's like, yeah, we still uh don't [ __ ] want it. So, like there there was like a lot of uh a lot of belief shifting moments um like in that trip just alone. But yeah, all on the right path now thankfully. Yeah, I mean our stuff has just b I mean it's just the frame has shifted to it's possible to get to these much larger numbers. At these much larger numbers, you can either choose to just cash flow crazy hard or you can choose to build out some structure and team and kind of sacrifice some of the cash. Um, I know a lot of people who would sacrifice the cash and never get the exit. And that's a game and that's real and that's a real thing where you're biting whatever it is in payroll or team or data or finance and stuff to make it so it could potentially be and you never hit it and you just burned all the cash that you could have just taken and just, you know, put away somewhere safe and sound and live for the rest of your life. So like you're playing you're it's a gamble at some level. Um, especially it's a gamble because we've never done it mainly. So it's like that goes back to the original thing is like can you hire for experience? Can you hire someone that's a fractional CMO or I'm sorry a CFO or like a COO at scale or a full-on that's been through the space that now starts to build all your financials and your data in a way that like it just imports directly into someone who's looking to buy this like maybe does it have to get to the size where it's 10 million is it 30 million is it 50 million in IBIDA like those are sizable numbers versus like a 3 to 5 million to where like and again 30% margins 20% margins on 100 150 like you know that's not unrealistic and As long as you can do some of those core pieces and get them out of, you know, get rid of make them make it a machine. Make it that so it's not info expert founderled product and fulfillment. Make sure it's not that only on the marketing side as well as like multiple channel acquisition as mult multiple acquisition models low ticket you know vs like these different things and flows and know all the numbers around it and the data and then have the team that operates it like that's at least the right direction. I can tell you that you know uh what are the 70 things I don't know that we're going to come up on? It's going to be like, "Oh, you don't track this or know this number because it like, you know, I'm sure that's there and it's not even on the I don't want to say it's not on the radar because it's on the radar, but Radar is three, five, you know, it's out there. It's cash flow the out of this thing. Build it up and like have it a more well-known brand." And we'll see. And in the meantime, cash flow the [ __ ] out of it and make it so it's like an actual, you know, not you're just pouring everything back in for some future potential thing. It's like we should be able to scale healthy this time and we didn't last time. So, that's where we're at. I love it. coming up on an hour and a half. You got any other fun? Yeah. Yeah. I I got one for you, man. You can answer the same for me, but like what is a habit that you have that is like really [ __ ] unconventional or maybe even like weird, but you swear by it in terms of making you more successful? That's a good one. No one ever asked me questions. Um, what is a habit that's unconventional is the crazy one. I I I don't know how unconventional it is, but I just kind of explained it a bit earlier, but like I will map something out and like make a plan on it and then live within that machine and like be a cog within it sometimes extend like for too long like way too long and like live in that. And more recently, I've kind of had the moments of like set aside the time to like zoom out and relook at the machine. But like if I set a plan, I will it's the whole process. It's the how do I find what I want to how I'm going to build the plan. It's who I find that already has it. It's I model it off someone who's very as close as possible been in a situationish where I have been and has gotten to said result that I want and that's in whatever lane that's a physical like a fitness that's a personal that's a business model that's whatever. It's then back into it and model it and whether they have info whether they have a course or they have something it's like I'm buying it in 12 seconds. If it's just content on something, it's every book, it's every whatever. Build my own version of the plan based on that roughly feed it into all these things and structure it how that fits into my life and then just go into it and then have my metrics and I track everything on numbers and all that. What no matter what it is and it's like I just operate that and just like run that gambit over and over again. And that's how we've done everything. That's how we did the VSSL funnel. That's how we did low ticket. It's like we pay to play in these games. That's how I did this exact thing. I paid you know iman 20 grand and was like whatever. like and as valuable as it is in there, it was more so the kick in the ass and it was a build the plan and it was have like we literally talked for an hour and I like set the intention of what it was and it was like here's the targets, here's the this and that and it was like cool and now I've just like every day just been operating within that. Blew through the targets, smash through them and now it's like zoom back out, what's the new goal? Okay, how would I iterate the machine? Go back into it and like the constant change of like what's the goal? What's the model and re-engineer it? I think is maybe unconventional or maybe just something I do. No, I like that. It It's also very interesting that you you often describe yourself as like a cog in a greater machine and you're like you're not like trapped in there, but it is like a box that you just frequently Yeah. No, it's like in the business versus on the business like of yourself all the time. I'm like working in it right now. I'm not on it. And then I'll zoom out and I'll try and like work on it or like change the idea of it. And I think at scale it probably makes more sense to live more on the on it side and like up here. But like where I'm at right now and the season I'm at and like my skill set evolution of not having an EA and working freaking 18 hours a day when I could work eight hours a day and probably do the same amount of stuff, but I'm not good at it yet to where I can like do what we talked about and deep block. It's like so many shortcomings, but it gets done, you know, it gets like it gets done. What about you? Uh for unconventional habits, I'm on premises. This is just just, you know, me being weird, but I'm such a huge believer in getting your deep work done in the dark. Like if if you don't have even light coming in to distract you, I think like, oh, like how is light a distraction? The way I think about it, and this could be totally factually incorrect, but I'm just going to believe it to be true because it works. But if I think of what happened in like hunter gather tribes when you're going out on like an actual hunt, you you're like looking out over the horizon. The way that human eyes are developed, they're in the front of our face. They're they're not in the sides like most uh like like most mammals, right? They're in the front of our face. So it's designed to have a very very wide field of view. when you're hunting and your perception is elevated, you take all the uh peripheral peripheral vision and just kind of zoomed it in so that you're just really focusing on one thing. So, I took that logic and just applied it to, you know, 2025, the the 21st century. And I was like, if I had to be as focused as humanly possible, I'd want to cut out all of the peripheral information that's coming into my eyes so that there's only one thing actually in front of me. Yeah. Yeah. And for me, like having things that are lit up around me, like if I if I compare my productivity at dark hours compared to like light hours, it's actually quite a big difference. Like I'm I'm significantly more productive in the dark. And I think that's why because I'm just I'm reducing all of the peripheral information that's coming in cuz our eyes are trying to make sense of all the information around us at all times. Yeah. How can I narrow that to like one specific thing and watch it make me more productive? So that's that's what I was. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. I mean, I guess I've never I've definitely never looked at it like that. Let's be clear here. But like that's what I do. I mean, mine blocks in the morning and it's because no one's on. It's because I'm just in it. It's because, you know, coffee and it's like the bright light and I'm like, which is probably terrible, but like I'm just like I'm in I'm in my own world over here. And then by afternoon and stuff, it's like I just want to talk and just lean back and just like make the sit and like, you know, have conversations and do all that, but catch me dead trying to be like, "Okay, cool. I'm going to deep block this afternoon after I just like gymmed or ate or did whatever." And I'm like, you know, I'm not going to sit there and turn on. I don't know. This is not me. But that's a good one. That's a good one. Yeah. Well, cool. All right. 140. I got a pop. You got a pop. Anything else you want to leave them with? I mean, everyone knows where to find you, so that's just easy. Yeah. Yeah. Park brands, too. That's good. It's classic. It's on brand. Damn right. Damn right. No, that's it, dude. Thank you again for having me. Uh, I meant everyone by what I said with your content, man. It really is good. And I know you have the right intention with doing things and it's coming from always a place of humility, which shockingly is hard to find. So, I I appreciate it, man. keep doing it. I appreciate that. All right, guys. Well, that's day 76, I believe, in the books. So, we'll talk to you soon.
