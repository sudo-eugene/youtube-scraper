# The #1 Thing Holding Your Funnel Back (Live Q&A) | EP87
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1O0SO-3lGE

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be going through our weekly weekend Q&A round six. Every single week, you guys submit questions into the request box, and every week I answer all of them. So, today we've got beginner marketing funnels, how to get done, 20K per month agency scaling, pre-existing info product scaling, organic versus paid ads, and the pros and cons. A lot of good questions, and a lot of context. I promise that by the end of this, you're going to come away with a nugget. Either it's from a question that someone asked or some way that we think through it. All right. Last year, we did $30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 75, I think 76 million in total cash collected, and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool All right, so let's get into it. First question, beginner marketer funnel. I have no idea what you mean by this. Um, there's a lot of beginner marketing funnels. Uh, in info and coaching, it is extremely common for someone to do a DTA funnel as the first one. So, direct to app. Other people call it a direct to VSSL. You can watch other videos on the channel where I talk about this. But the simplest simplest is probably something that's to book a phone call. I would say maybe an opt-in funnel where it's just like a free lead magnet, but not like a full-fledged. Uh, if you're thinking beginner, I don't really understand the question, so I think you should probably answer it or ask it a little differently. Um, but yeah, I'm going to move to the next one. Uh, I'm a co-owner for an info product company. Nice. Same. Uh, we run a Tik Tok and Instagram to DM a book a call funnel. Our main bottlenecks are unqualified bookings. Everyone's saying they have less than 500 to invest. How would you change the content messaging? So, we target higher qualified leads and would you say you shorten the amount of DMs to book as many as call possible and put the qualifying questions in the Cly page itself? What's the best way to make sure leads are qualified and show up? All right, couple things here. One, so it's consumption/qualification. So first things first, instead of pushing them all to a phone call, you can push them somewhere else that you capture their info. So you can push them to get them to qualify themselves more. So you can run them into uh you can either get them to opt in for something uh you can qualify them there. Like if you look at an example like when HubSpot gives away something or uh does like a qualification, they will uh for like a lead magnet, they'll have qualifying questions in the opt-in. So that's one way. You already kind of said that here on the book a call. So yeah, you want to make sure that you are qualifying them before a call. You don't want to waste bandwidth of a sales rep or whoever pre doing that. So whether that's in an application, whether that's in a calendarly page or in the booking, whether that is in the opt-in itself, whether that's in the messaging you do inside this portion. So you can shorten the amount of DMs. You can qualify them in the DM, like in DM before you push them to a call. So I think you're already answering your own question. Um, right here, this is generally like pretty top of funnel and broad. The other bigger thing is like clearly how you what you're talking about up here is bringing those people in. So like the very very top of this is what content you're actually producing. And if that content is bringing in the $500 people and you have nothing to sell them or that's not your target person, like you can change the content itself and it'll, you know, go upstream. So if you change that first, that'll trickle down. But then yeah, the middle layer stuff is definitely necessary. So either qualifying them through DM, uh qualifying them on an application, sending them somewhere that is instead of direct to a call, you can have something lower ticket you can sell them that maybe that they can then ascend. Um you can sell or you can just give something free and try and qualify them as well. um build community. Like a lot of people for example will use a lot of these like top offunnel content and push them into a free community um school whatever they'll push them into there and then to send them from there. People do them to an opt-in to give them some free like everything from a free training which is a VSSL generally um to free courses stuff like that. So you get them in, they get more consumption, and then even though if they have less than 500, which they can blatantly lie to you, by the way, um if they have less, you still need the consumption before they're ready to buy something that's 2K, 5K, 10K, 30K, right? Like generally speaking. So, and then once, yeah, I mean, this kind of answers that once you know they're qualified is a little different than showed up. Um because showing up is you need a reason for them to show up and you need the proper reminders and stuff. But solve for the first one and then uh DM me about this because I'm happy to help. How do you get done? Um, too many hours, not enough focus. I'm terrible at this 100%. So, definitely need to work on this. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I just work a lot, but I work kind of haphazardly and scattered right now. And that is something I need to work on. Uh, what's the best way to grow to 20K per month as an agency? Also, should spend some money or stay locked in until 50K. Um, definitely stay locked in until beyond 50K. I'm going to tell you that. Um, but what's the way to grow to 20K per month as an agency? I've never run an agency, so I don't have a good answer for you here directly. Um, I personally like higher ticket. So, I would have a couple performance deals that can get me there. You could have one deal that gets you there pretty easily in my opinion. Um, but if you're just trying to do like small service and do the volume game, you know, 10 at 2K is really not that big of a deal. Um, you just have to come up I don't I don't know your offer is. I don't know how much your offer is or what you're selling. For example, I know a lot of people are doing and I talk about it on here a lot is the AI agency stuff. A lot of people are doing that. Uh which again is more so selling the result and then making it sexy as the mechanism using AI. So basically you sell whatever automated thing uh or whatever the result is of said automated thing and then you do it through AI and it's like a sexy way to sell it. So people do it for uh lead generation, people do it for efficiencies within the business. But something that you can quantify is, you know, you're making them 100k in value and you're just going to charge 20 G's. And that can be across, you know, multiple clients. So it could be you're making them 10 grand, you're charging them two grand or whatever. So yeah, that's what I would focus on. Um, but I need some more context here on what you're trying to do. And there's a million people who talk about this on YouTube who do really well and find somebody who actually runs an agency and then listen to them. Can you talk about in-depth on how to retain clients? It's not talked about enough. how often you should check in, onboarding, etc. Yeah. So, again, also probably not the best person for this, but um what is Dan Martell has a book um that's all about software, but you can use that book. It's I think it's uh software as a ser no not software as a service that would be too easy. Um it's like it's something like that. It's like software service something along those lines. Um but it's a really good book that talks about this which is all about in software you know it's a math problem essentially is what he breaks down but that churn is a huge piece of that and how to do things in onboarding activation client touch points um so you can use that for service not and and group coaching and one-on-one coaching but yeah it's extremely important to have proper onboarding extremely important to have a proper check-ins it's extremely important to have all that kind of stuff like when they're at their peak point you know sign resign them like all those things um so Again, probably not the best person here, but for ours, for example, just to give you a little bit more context, um, our stuff is going to have essentially daily communication onetoone. It's going to have monthly that's going to have a ton of touch points that happen all month. And then more so what it is is like that transitionary period for the next uh for like the renewal essentially uh is at the peak points and then towards the end as like a final bucket to scoop them into um or like have them land in if they didn't get it throughout the middle. So, not really answering it, but again, same as this answer, go to somebody who does agency specific because I'm sure there's some way that's like specific around how you do wins and when you guys have big successes talking about increasing XYZ service or going further or whatever. But I also know and I have heard that, you know, you get them the results and the next thing they do is they want more results or the changes that happen because now they want to go this other direction. Like I've heard that happens a lot in agency and I don't know cuz I don't run an agency. Um, if you had to begin from zero and had no network, I've had no network up until 90 days ago. Uh, how would you do things differently to get to the point where you're at today? No back-end product or teams behind only selfquidating offer funnels. Oh jeez. What products, markets, upsells? Um, I would do something. I don't know. I don't know if you're asking if you're telling me that I can have no back-end product or teams and it's strictly direct response selfquidating offers. Uh, that's also kind of not my game. So there's direct response guys that crush this. Um they do it with ecom, they do it with info, they do it with a lot of things. Um communities, MR. So I like backend stuff. I like actual scaled like business, not just like one-time offer. Um I do know that something that mid if you can land on something mid-t you have a little bit more room. But there are guys who do 50k a day all day every day either as an affiliate or I know a guy that does it with his own offer that he owns that's front- end profitable with low ticket. So, and they're in the how do I not they're in the health space. Um so they do something in there. I know guys who do it with supplements all the time. Um I know affiliates that do it. So I don't know. I mean for me I would do backend and I would do team. So I would do something that has higher ticket. I would do something that has legs that has commissions. And so I've used this example a lot, but like insurance for example or like financial management, taxation, that kind of stuff. You can sell them on info or low ticket or middle. That's either break even or lose a little bit money or I guess you could do it if you stack the right stuff with upsells. You could do it profitably. Um but you make all the money on the back like all the big big money because you get percents of whatever deal size or value or transaction like you make more money on the back and that's what a lot of businesses are. I don't really do a lot of stuff that's like, you know, make 20% on the front end day on day and then just like that's all you do. So, how to scale a pre-existing info product that another info agency made without starting again from scratch. How to scale a pre-existing info. I'm going to need a lot more information than that. Um, because you're going to have to build it around how to scale a pre-existing info product that has another info agent that another info agency made. I mean, if it already exists, you just scale it. So, find what's broken. Find the spot of where it's pinched currently, or is the cost per booking too high? Is the cost per sale too high? Is the cost per sale too high on a on a low ticket because of the ad creative and the cost per click and the whatever or because the conversion on page or is the offer just bad? Is the fulfillment not get the ascension? Is the fulfillment not built in a way to have as like I have no idea. Do you have a back-end program? Do you not? So, I don't have enough context to give you accurate. Make a video about what you do in your personal life to make your work life easier, such as chef, meal prep, any automations for your personal email, contacts, routines, no electronics, go in depth. Okay. Um, I can do this. Um, but I do terrible at this. So, I'm just going to give you a brief thing like try and get up early. Um, for a while it was 4:00 or 5 in the morning. Lately, it's like 6:00 7. Um, I did do meal prep for a long time, but now I just eat ground beef or freaking cold cuts basically. Uh, I'm on this computer all day and I don't need to be because I don't have that much work, but I'm scattered. I do not have an EA yet. So, I am scheduling all these interviews and doing all these videos and all this pre- stuff and post stuff myself uh and running the business. So, I'm not doing this well. I know all the right things you're supposed to do and I don't do them. I do not turn off my phone at a certain time. I do not stop answering things at a certain time. I do not get rid of electronics at a certain time and I do not sleep a certain amount of time. Um, I am an example of the worst model of this in current state. I wake up, I get coffee, I get water, and I sit down at this desk. So, that's the gist, but maybe once I dial this in, I'll make a video about it. Hey, Ryan, I think I'm making a survey of sorts to gather what time prospects would prefer to book their call if a calendar was empty. Collect data and see if there's a trend on what time would be and sort the factor into sales rep's calendars. Lowish prospects, we're going to try and give you save you guys the gist here. Contacts, we use a grading system that app inputs one to three. Okay, so they rate their bookings. Good. The level four books, what available calendar and shows the preferred two days. We look for level twos to replace, but example is this. Sorry, I'm just trying to rip through this. If high quality prospects show a trend wanting to book two days out, then create a content barrage system. Obviously, they would want I don't think this is a high point of return to business, but I do want to get your thoughts. Mainly because this is fun. Yeah, it is fun. Um, I wouldn't optimize around this at all. I would not try and backfill and game the system because you're going to have outliers every single time and it is there is technically yes you can find this we've done this and found you know what window or 4hour window or two-hour window is the hottest point and have coverage on that but the real answer is just have coverage so what we've tested in our market which is B toc is a 48 hour booking window leave it as that you go beyond that and you start to get show rates that fall through the floor setters try and book same day if they can't fill same day they go one day more, they go one day out, then they go two days out. And the setters actually are allowed to go three days out because they have the touch point of communication, not just automations for show rates. Um, so they're allowed to go beyond the booking widget, which also makes it so that the marketing booking widget stays at 48 on purpose and then the setter one goes out 72, but they try and push them as soon as soon as possible. So, hammer them strat, yes, it works dynamically, so you don't need to worry about that. Um, I mean, you're right, like you're they're going to get less content if it's a shorter amount of time, but if someone's trying to book like soon, you want them to be able to book soon. So, the real answer is get the coverage. Yes, this grading system, we actually don't we kind of do this, but we only do it in two buckets right now. Um, because we have the availability, right? We can book hundreds of calls a day with the calendars we have and we're actually pushing for more availability from current team and current state. Um, but yeah, that's that's what I would do um more so. And then yes, rank them and yes, put the top ones with the top closers. And yes, have this visible to at least the decision-making people on the team. Maybe not the reps because sometimes I'm torn on this because sometimes if you give them too much information or they think that it's an unqualified whatever person it somebody who's unqualified because of what they filled out on something is not necessarily unqualified and that is not like source of truth and like live by that because ours have historically showed to back out less too but they still close. We've also run like API tools against them of what they've said versus what they actually have financially or whatever with things like leadfy and whatever and they actually come back that they have more money sometimes than some of these other people. So, it really depends on how someone fills out your application, which is kind of hard for this, but yeah, that's what I would do. Can you please talk about organic versus paid ads for marketing? Like pros and cons of both. Yeah. Um I know so many more people now that do organic than paid um that I've met online and like through this and they crush. So the reason you can have margins you can have so like simple math is if you just sell something on the front end which is not super realistic but like let's say you do and you have a 3x return like quick simple math let's call it 30% uh immediately is burned on your P&L because you're using paid ads versus these guys that can do 70 80 90% like I had uh William Brown on here and he was talking about how they did 83% margin last uh or currently at like five or six hundred grand a month and that's because he has him and two people basically on fulfillment moment and all the uh all the traffic is organic. So he has no paid ads and he has the leanest team you could possibly think of and that's his only like you know his couple simple softwares and that's about it. So crazy. Um for us paid ads is it's the consistency around it as well. So we are booking calendar spots. We want the consistency and then we can't generate it through organic. We've never leaned in or with organic and we're doing this now enough to where it generates there. Right now, organic is like 1% of our first click. Everything is paid. And then our organic exists as our content more so exists as middle and bottom of funnel more so than it does uh as first click. So, we're working on that actually right now to build that out more. Um because I see a huge lever here and this is like brand. This is all that. And we produce a ton of content. It just doesn't really exist as you know initial source. So, I like organic. I think everyone should build it. I think they should build it over time and it compounds on itself. It's a whole brand game, but paid ads are quick. Paid ads you can scale into. Paid ads you can also spend a ton of money in a day and get no results and that money's gone forever, right? Versus content that's like this ever growing and compounding wheel. So I easy answer is do both, right? Um and if you're like strapped for time and whatever and you need money now style thing and like you're trying to grow this quick, it's paid. But I would always be producing stuff organic to begin to build in that direction. We went we're like too late to the party on having organic as like our core source. But yeah, so I think that answers your question, but organic is better for P&L, longer term, better brand, all that kind of stuff. But if you don't have something or if you're trying to do like an offer that's like, you know, a flash and it's going to be gone in three months or a year or whatever, like just go for paid and make it work because organic building around something is going to take x amount of time to do. Generally, there are people who pop off on this and do really well really early. Um, but like the general norm is it takes longer. Um, what is the proc what is the I'm sorry. What's the process if you came across a sales call that isn't compliant? And what specifically you have found material both sales that that non-compliant that surprised you? Also, do you magically lose those called recording? Um, so yeah, we have scripts around this and then we also have AI checkers that are on the back uh in the back end um that will check all this kind of stuff. So there's just tools you can use and you can do it like out of I mean you can either use tools that already exist or nowadays it's like pretty easy to just like plug in open API like just plug it into Zap, plug it into whatever and have those done. HubSpot has auto recordings of those done. Um and then the real thing here is solving for it on the front end more so than solving for it on the back end. And that is more around the scripting and how it's done. Like yes, people can go off script, but you want to kind of train on not having that. make sure that the script is built in a way that's not that uh that doesn't have stuff like this. Um and then again, we don't our whole methodology for what we do is like is long-term. This is not quick fix. This is not, you know, overnight. This is not XYZ. Um you know, all these CL, excuse me, all these client results are from, you know, a year or more of the program. So, I don't know. We're not We don't really live in this land, so I don't know. But there's like Anuk made an entire book on this that you can you know take templates I'm sure and use stuff and then you can always look backwards with AI uh really easily. What are your thoughts on this? If I want to gift someone entry in a program by covering the cost, what what would be negatively affecting the likelihood of them using succeeding in said program as there aren't ones that are committing financially? Would you book them the call and then have them contact you about the investment or ruin surprise price reveal and send them them up front? How would you go about doing this? Top five rhymes for sure. By the way, I'm not sure what that means, but um so we've done this in the past, way early days. Uh it was actually funny. One of the initial people we gave a test product because we launched a new product. We were like early early days, like we were doing like 30 grand a month probably. Uh we gifted somebody the program as like uh we're launching this new thing and we want to get some feedback on it. And that person then went through the product. They ended up buying the next product we came out with that was probably $1,000 at that time. and then uh became one of the sales reps, was our top sales rep, then became our sales manager and was a rockstar right at the time uh for what we needed and where she was at in life and all that. So, there are edge cases that will work. Um you're right though, most people that come into it, unless it's like some crazy qualified but like can't afford sponsorship opportunity or scholarship more so opportunity, um generally speaking, they're not going to take it as seriously because they didn't put money up. they didn't figure out a way to make it work. They aren't doing it in that way. Um, but there's definitely ways to do it, right? Um, there are things like people do giveaways and like sponsorships of that. It's like over these five days, everyone submit into this thing and you know, we're going to pick one that's a winner that's going to get sponsored for a yearong free of the program, which only costs you your delivery. So, if it's a course, basically nothing. Uh, if it's info or if it's coaching, it costs you paying a coach for a year or six months or whatever. issue with that a lot of the time at scale is that then people don't purchase over that window because they think they're going to be the one of 5,000 people that entered. So your like close rates just tank. Um that happens a little bit internally too if you do it for like renewals, but the beauty with renewals is they kind of batch, right? So well they can batch. So yeah um uh yeah I mean yes do it. I don't know that you'd make a big like deal about it. Um, but if you find someone that you think is going to be able to succeed because they have done XYZ and they are like yearning for it, but they can't afford it and you see some reason to give them to that either out of like morally or out of the good of your heart or because you see them ascending into something later or joining your team, like yeah, do it. Who cares? Just understand the cost because if it's coaching, you have a real cost and if it's info, you have an XYZ cost. So yeah, the programs you bought or torrented. Dude, I haven't torted something in like ever, 20 years. Um, are torrented, we don't judge. Rate them one out of 10 from quality while you bought. All right. Um, let me pull this up. I have a list of all of these courses. Um, I made an entire video on this, so actually just look that up because that'll be easier. I don't want to waste a bunch of people's time, but um, the core ones that stand out in my head are Becker's that he no longer sells. He sold Iron Mastermind, I think it was called at the time, and it was a Trojan horse to get people into Hyros. Um, that was a really good one. And then at the same time, I bought consulting. Um, I bought one of Sam Ovens's course back in the day, his mid-level program. Instantly learned that I was not going to be the type that was going to be, um, you know, the consultant and like sell my info and all that kind of stuff or whatever. So, uh, in that course though is where I met the co-founder of the current company and they were doing, you know, 30 grand a month and joined up with them and the rest is history. So, I met them in that course. So, that was the best one. But, I have bought tons of courses. I just posted on X. Like I bought two or three courses in a weekend and we implemented pieces and parts of all of them and put together the VSSL funnel that then did 70 million for us. So like I always buy courses non-stop um whenever we need something. So like Cole Gordon has some really good stuff that we've bought for sales management. Um we've bought stuff on YouTube ads when we wanted to learn and implement YouTube ads. We've bought things on physical e-commerce and like Tik Tok shop when that was like a thing we were interested in and we never actually launched. Um, we've bought stuff. I have a whole list over here. I've done a ton of affiliate stuff. We've bought Peter Kell stuff, VSSL expert. Uh, we've bought like peak performance or like an individual like for yourself things. We've bought a ton of ecom courses, agency courses, social media scaling, native building. I bought Wall Street prep classes, which are like L. Like I bought all these things. Um, so I could make an entire video on this. Again, I already did, but I could make it probably cleaner. But yeah, go check out that one. Um, Ryan, I'll keep it real with you. I'm 20. I started saddling Asia. I run a YouTube marketing agency focused on AI and SAS companies, and I've been struggling to land clients consistently. Right now, I've got two clients. One came from random Twitter and one in March, but they churned. Okay. I do about 20 to 25. Okay. So, you're trying to do outreach me outreach messages. Um, you've tried the free game. I have two two case studies, six testimonials, and I'm known for content. Since pivoting towards marketing, my numbers dropped unless I put AI in our title or caption. So now I'm wondering, should I lean back into AI to pull people into my YouTube offer? Is that something else I'm missing? Why promote AI? People are coming to me for this. I help with full YouTube process, strategy, scripting, SEO posting. I'm trying to charge a minimum of two and a half thousand a month. Any feedback would mean a lot. I have affiliate marketing deals. My expenses are like $200 a month. I don't go sightseeing or anything. Maybe once every two months. Okay. So you're working hard. you're doing in Asia, you're young, you have some clients uh success stories, but people are not buying your thing. So core thing is your offer. If you had an amazing offer, you wouldn't even need to market at the root of it because you would get so many referrals and you would have such good results that people would tell everybody about you. So that's case in point one. Two is how you're getting them to you, which right here, you're trying to do outreach messages. is I can tell you right now I have 50 of these in my DM a day about basically doing this strategy scripting editing thumbnails SEO posting um so having something that's unique offer um like you said trying to do work for free um but yeah you need to hone in the offer and then yeah you need to figure out a consistent way to where is it consistent way to generate clients starting with the offer then the lead flow okay so that's what I would say there um and then also like if you're already building these you know how to do this I I don't know anything about this, but I see tons of people doing this faceless like AI content and stuff and like crushing it. So maybe there's a game where you're not doing an agency like when you can just do it for yourself. So I don't know why you wouldn't just build your own. Um whether that's the faceless ones, whether that Yeah, like because that sounds like the easiest one. And then you can be on any time zone, you can do whatever you want whenever you want. You don't have client calls. You don't have agency work. You don't have clients. Like you're just like cranking out AI YouTube content and you already know how to do this part, the SEO, the posting. So like you can already build it up. And you said you have affiliate marketing deals. like lean into a bucket that I mean agency's nice is because you have no out of pocket and I'm sure there's a cost to like generate those AI videos, but unless you have an offer and you have good enough case studies and testimonials and then you have consistent lead flow and you want to be on whatever time zone managing clients and doing your thing, like I don't know enough about this game. So, this is actually kind of like probably not my lane to be talking about. But yeah, that's what I would do cuz right here like they're churning client churn is so real. Like you can just own these assets. So that's my thought. Not a topic, but you should get Matt Larson. I will look him up. Um, I built my brand in self-help market in Hungary. Sold more than 1K from one low ticket product. Sold more than 1,000. Is that $1,000 or 10,000 people? Um, now I want to build the same funnel in English. I was thinking about three different offers priced at 27, 3747, maybe only two offers. No mid ticket. My goal is to reach as many people as possible. I would do it through cold traffic. Have experience creating viral videos. Can I make it work and scale to 510K? How would you recommend the best resource for mastering low ticket funnels? Um, low ticket funnels, I would go into Alen Sultanic. He's in nothing held back group. I would just start there in general. I don't know enough about this. I don't know why you'd have multiple offers. Um, unless they're in Ascension. I would do one straight line. I would sell one offer. I'm not sure if your self-help worked because it was in Hungary and native and like local language and then you're going to try and run it in English and it's not going to work or if your product's good enough that it will work globally or in US market or whatever. I don't I don't know enough about that. um four years. Can I make it work to scale to 5K, 10K or even higher? I assume what you're saying is this. So yeah, I mean if it's a bigger market, but like 1K either in dollars or people is likely not that large in this market, but I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. So again, need more context, but go into nothing held back group and he'll be able like he has automatic clients that's all about low tickets. Um Josh Gavin has a bunch of stuff that's about low ticket um that they do. There's a ton of guys in that group that do a lot of low tickets. So that's probably your best starting point, but you probably can go deeper here before you have to try and do this English market if you have like a hold already in this best payment processor outside of Stripe. I process about 100 to 2K 100. So we still use Stripe because we have very low chargebacks. We have good fees with them, but there's it's a big risk um because they store and tokenize everything and like it's all trapped inside there. So we have backups. Um again, this is another thing. go into uh I think your name is Patricia inside um the Nothing Held Back group. There's tons of people in there. Um Deposit is one. There's a bunch of different um NMI guys. There is uh authorized.net. Like those are all like the top the mid layer, but then they'll get processors that are like under there. The mids they'll they will be able to get you different mids that then sit inside those. Um so yeah, and then it can just plug into whatever you use. So the other thing is Um, so just go over to the WAP guys and yeah, they have you get instant approved basically for anything and you can do size through them. So they do have some fees that are a little different, but it makes sense and works and like everyone's already on the platform and they also have out of the box third party financing. So I would do that um because that's a pretty, you know, you don't want to get stuck anywhere with that. Um, I makeund 100 to 150k per month in my agency but constantly fear the agency game is a ticking time bomb and it'll be replaced by AI or go out of business. are these normal fears that you face. How do you deal with fear of losing it all, losing it all once becoming successful? Um, and you don't deal with this. Um, but this is solid. And I don't know what the service is, but the real thing is, and Eddie Malof talks about this, right? He he runs a large agency, but they talk about how they're just using AI internally. So, that's the goal here. I don't know what the service is that if someone can just directly do it on their own but like you at least internally can be saving huge huge if your team is using it or you have a couple people on team instead of a 30 person team you have a 15 person team because they use AI in a good way so your costs mo you know go down and but you can do the same amount of service so I would start there is just in doing it inhouse and then seeing where it goes um but yeah I mean this is real and this is like I've heard uh my first million podcast they talk about this, you know, you're at 20 or 50 million or whatever. Um, and you still fear this. So, that's about how you store your cash. That's about how you live your lifestyle. That's about how you've upgraded your lifestyle and now all of a sudden you spend 50 grand a month because you make 100 150 and it's like that is where it starts to get funky versus like stockpiling cash or putting in XYZ safe investment or whatever. Um, to make it so you don't have this fear of losing it all. Um, but the inflow is real. The fear of losing the inflow is real. And knowing how to build this to sell it, knowing how to build this in a way that is has more cash flow because you're using AI inside the business because you guys find something that you're doing with AI and then you sell that as a specific service. Just like being on the front. So um EP or whatever his name is always, you know, front runners like you need to be ahead of this stuff and just focus on that mindset. Um okay, I can do some videos on that. Uh, what's your opinion on guarantees versus no guarantees for scaling a coaches coaching business to a million ARR? Okay, you already have over 50 documented case studies, but close rate on VSSL traffic sucks. 5K into 5% into a 12K offer. Um, all right. So, a couple things here. Uh, guarantees. Yeah, there's a lot of ways to look at guarantees. You just have to actually they have to be compliant and you have to abide by them. Um, but guarantees like if they're legit and it's actually reasonable for the person to follow it, like if they do XYZ thing and they don't get the result, then you give them their money back, like all good. Um, if they, you know, if you make them do a million in one hoops to jump through, like those are kind of gray area in my opinion, guarantees. Um, but it depends. I guess it depends because like I like those, right? So, I like some actionbased guarantees, but just has to be not too crazy. Um, there's a lot of them out there. And again, it's just making sure it's compliant. You don't need guarantees, though. If your offer is good enough, you don't need a guarantee. We didn't do guarantees for a very long time. Like, we even still I mean, we do have one now, but like even then, um, a million AR is what, 100K a month. It's 83K a month. Um, I'm not sure why that target what that target is or what, but again, you can either use them or not. You shouldn't need them if you have a good offer. Um, but it's always nice you can throw on there, uh, as long as it's realistic for them to be able to do it. Um 50 documented case studies is good for sure, but close rate on your traffic sucks. 5% it depends on what you're saying 5% is. If 5% is of leads, that's good in our in my opinion depending on it's all about your economics. So it's like if you have $5 leads, that's a fantastic CPA if you if you're doing lead. But if that is your if it's 5% of calls and you have a $200 call, that is not good, right? Because you have what is that? $4,000 CPA on a 12K offer. Like not great. Not bad, but not it's not terrible, but it's not great. So, depends on what it is there. But that's your funnel, entire funnel. That could be your VSSL. That could be your I mean, that could be the whole thing. You I have no idea. So, I don't know if it's your ads. I don't know if it's your opt-in page. I don't know if it's your VSSL. I don't know if it's your application. I don't know if it's your sales reps. I don't know if it's your show rate. Like, there's a lot of numbers here that I can't tell by just hearing 5%. And again, I don't know if you're talking about 5% close rate, if you're talking about 5% show rate, if you're talking about 5% opt-in rate. So, you can DM me about this. But yeah, you need to solve for the funnel because 50 documented case studies is good. So, yeah, I'm getting real traction on an on on an anonymous Tik Tok sharing entertainment behind the scenes. Look at my niche career. Not this is my life of an IB analyst, but more along the lines of vending machine investment education. Getting real specific. There's clear interest and I believe a low ticket info product or paid community to be a great fit. If you were starting from scratch and aiming to go from 0 to 10k per month, how would you map out? Yeah, so you can either the the best way to do it is to give away something for free. Um, so have them join a community where you give value in there. That's just nuggets in a free community. Um, so all that's doing is moving the audience from somewhere you don't own them to somewhere you kind of own them. So whether that's an email list, whether that is uh a Facebook group, whether that's a school group, whether that's a  group, whatever. Um I would move them into a group. Uh so you make a free one. You push them from there to there. So then you own them. Own them. Own the data uh through email and you own the data through a group and you provide a bunch of value to them and then you offer something on the back. So you have a 2K, you have a 5K, you have whatever that is structured education, that includes group coaching, that includes onetoone coaching, whatever. Then you go down like the offer matrix. So you go down or whatever you want to call it. Uh where it's one to one coaching is generally speaking the top and that's where you charge like 50 grand depending on what this offer is. It could be two grand I don't know but like generally speaking it's the highest ticket is going to be one to one with you. Then group with you is going to be the next lowest. So that's or the next down the tunch which is going to be call it 20k. Then the next trunch is going to be with coaches like a in a onetoone setting with a coach that you've hired because they're the pro now. And that's going to be X dollars, call it 10K. And the next one is going to be group with that person. Call it 2K or 5K. The next is just going to be a course uh with group coaching. That's going to be 2K. Then the next is just going to be just a course and that's a thousand bucks. Like whatever the math is, but like that's generally the hierarchy. I've also seen those flipped on their head, but that's a different story for another time. Um but yeah, that's how I'd map it out. So, I'd get them all into a free group, get them on an email list, and then come up with an offer that you see as valuable or they see as valuable more so, and then sell that. So, how can I navigate traditional industries such as solar, logistics, and other blue collar boring businesses within sales in general? I don't know what you mean, but with sales in general, yeah, I mean, these principles that you learn online can be applied there, and the principles you learn in bluecollar boring business can be applied online. uh depending on the skill set, just the part of the skill that you're learning is not necessarily the industry. The industry is just where you can go deep in it, right? So solar for example, if you're door knocking and doing that, you get the sales chops for that. There are ways that people that do that remote. There are also internet marketing tactics you can roll in there for inbound calls, for XYZ, for form fills, for leads, for whatever. There are people who do this at mass scale that do hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year uh in the full stack. There are guys that teach how to do solar sales and use info and internet marketing to get leads to sell a course for 2K or 5K to get into solar and teach them that and then put them inside their solar business and then own the whole solar company. There are guys that do it to teach people how to be solo, you know, franchise operators of or I don't know if it's actually franchise but like whatever it's called um downstream of them in solar and then they own the entire solar company up there and the sales agency that connects them with the providers. There are people that do that with everything. So I don't really know what you mean specifically. Um but you look like a cool Gordon for example business model with sales they take they go you know every industry but um let's just say just for internet marketing and high ticket sales they have like the multitrunch. So they have like they teach people how to do it. So they teach a general consumer how to get into online high ticket sales. They have a higher level program that is for B2B that teaches people or like has sales management whatever that then they can deploy these people and then they also sell to sales reps and like you know nine other things. So like they have owned that industry or that skill set uh of in that market right so and then they have multiple ways to monetize they have multiple offers within that stack they have some low ticket stuff they have some mid-t stuff like they just crush. So I don't necessarily know exactly what you're asking but I think that answers the question. So, uh, yeah, you guys didn't ask a ton of questions this week, which was surprising. Um, so pop into here in the request box and ask anything you have. Hopefully, this one was helpful. I feel like it was a lot of beginner questions. Um, today is day 86, 87 of making these every single day. All of them are documented here in www.rclog.comdoc. Um, and you can go by tech, marketing, ops, sales, mindset, any of the things, filter these out. Um but yeah and then if you just go here uh you will be able brought to the main page of that or just the channel and you can see all of them. So short video shorter video today 37 minutes but I will talk to you guys tomorrow.
