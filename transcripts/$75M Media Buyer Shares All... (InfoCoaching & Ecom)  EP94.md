# $75M Media Buyer Shares All... (Info/Coaching & Ecom) | EP94
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0yCKC2eTQ4

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing a live Q&A around marketing, media buying, all the things. We've got Luke here, co-founder and business partner, and Marius. Marius, close enough. And he does a media buying and a ton of media buying for guys in info and coaching space. So, we're going to go through the type form and go through all the questions. First one we got on here, uh, can you go more in depth about my Google friends angle with his Google My Vist my listing and affiliate PPC? So, on episode 85, I talked about somebody who does Google My Business um that essentially does localized Google My Business, has a bunch of them, let's just say, uh call it 50 of them that are in different cities and then he optimizes them for search engines and then has different paper call like different link uh phone numbers in there that then route out to networks and private buyers. So, he'll let's say landscaping for example or like pool installation. Uh he will have uh Google My Business, someone says, you know, pool installation or pool design near me. They look it up and Google My Business is one of the top things that uh pop up as like a local business near me. They click on the phone number, but it's not an actual direct business. It's just used for lead genen. So then he'll route them to local ones and people will pay $150 a lead or $12 a lead or $2 a lead depending on what network and what buyer. Um so he does that and is crushing it. Um last time I talked to him, he was doing whatever $300 to$500 bucks a day in profit. Um you know him actually, I'll tell you after this, but um yeah, cool dude and crushes it. He's done everything you can imagine. He just doesn't really like ad spend, doesn't really like the headache of it and like all that and doesn't like to media buy. So, he just does everything organic and just slow builds these things. So, that's that one. Next one from test at Gmail. I tell everyone they can put whatever email they want on here and put a fake one so they don't get docked. Uh, I have a business that sends super expensive home inspections that sends super insp expensive home inspections which are health focused. Okay. How would you market or position and how would you what would your funnel be? who've been going through referral partners but want to go direct and that I assume that came from you because that's not my land. Super expensive home inspections that are health focused. So they're basically I imagine they're doing something where people go and check out like check for mold, check for whatever. What kind of funnel would you do or just how would you get clients? I mean probably two options. Uh first one lead forms. The only problem with pleat forms would be the quality. Um but I've been actually talking with a lot of guys that do spend a decent amount of dollars a day and they just have lead forms. The only thing the only secret there is to properly uh route. So if the lead does not seem qualified, just do not fire anything on lead form because there's no pixel. So the only way for you to have good quality is let someone be an application only if they have every single requirement. So that would be option number one. Offer number two, have like a type of funnel because it's a very direct offer. Like you don't have to do a lot of convincing on that one. Like you just show them the offer, make them apply, see if they are a good lead or not. That's it. Make your if you send your type form, same thing. Have routing. If the lead does not answer like all of your questions the way you needed to, don't hire anything on them. We still call them. But yeah, we have uh a friend that does home services that does in person, uh Cody, and he was talking about this uh when we were on his uh podcast or whatever we're on, and he was talking about how it's basically like a cleaning service, like a home cleaning service, and they'll run localized ads. And the biggest difference, and what we kind of broke down on there was changing the offer. And he had talked to other guys who were like doing three times the amount on his I just inhaled that. We were talking uh odd on his about um basically how he had a buddy that was doing three times and the offer the only difference was that just how they structured the offer everything same media buyer same whatever same whole thing and so that was a big one. So for them it was like uh you know a free cleaning basically uh for their home and then it comes in there. So whatever. So that's the two things it's like yeah so the actual technical is run some application form lead form something so you get qualification you get all the information obviously run them localized to wherever you are and then the biggest thing on there is what offer. So it's a free home inspection. It's a free this and that likely and then once you're in there as you sell the service once you identify that there's a problem once you whatever xyz. So anything else I mean no I say that's it. Um ju just to add on top of that now you say this uh we do run some legion ads for a company in the pest control space and one of the biggest differences we see in quality is the type of offer we run it's like oh is it um 10 leads in 30 days or I'll get you 10 clients or I'll get you this I'll get you that or in your case like I guess it's vice versa because it's you want to get customers but yeah the the offer changed a lot. Yeah. And just for context, how much uh have you spent on meta, you think? I I would say across meta on Google. 75 75 million. So he does a lot of the big info. $75 total. Yeah. Got my first lead gen client. Um so no. Yeah, he spends mainly in info and uh ecom, but info like he does some of the biggest guys that we know, the eight figure a month guys at times, the a lot of things. So just FYI. Um next one in here. What is the best funnel for organic audience high ticket info and how would you go about sending traffic to it? Okay. Well, how would you go about sending traffic to it? It's organic. So, I think that's it would links, right? Links in bio, this and that. Uh, you know, YouTube, there's a Hormosi video where they talk about it, but it's just look at any Hormosi video. They have the two links right above the fold in the description. They have them then in a pinned comment because you want as many opportunities to have CTA and then using actual in the content piece, go and see the comments or do whatever um to do that. Same thing with Instagram store. Whatever you guys I'm sure understand that. But best for high ticket info, what the best funnel is. I think Yeah. Good. I think that that's just like a flawed way of thinking. I agree. There's not like a best anything. There's people who make every single kind of funnel that there is work. So, it's more so like what is your offer? What are competitors doing? You know, how good are you at different pieces? and just, you know, not looking at it so binarily. You know, I think you you you look at like funnels that work and you assume, oh, someone just had an idea and just made this funnel and now it's working. But it's just really never like that. It's like you try your funnel, figure out where it's broken, look at the stats at different steps in different stages in different places, try and figure out what's not good about it, what needs to change about it, and then um you know, you make one work is more so what you're looking for. Um there isn't like just a best funnel. Uh I think that definitely you should have you should have a VSSL ingredient in it. Like so there has to be a strong message but how that gets delivered can be in a million different ways in my opinion. I have such a different opinion. So do you what do you have? Yeah probably there are good funnels and especially for high ticket organic best I mean webinar and VSSL you probably can do both of them super well. Um that's so funny. Exactly. Mine is completely you can do both of them super well. Yeah. But like you can do DTA super well. You could do a regular webinar funnel super well. You could do you could do every funnel super well. So depending on if you run B2B or your offer is B2B, right? Like what we saw let's say whenever we run something B2B and the price point starts at like we need to argue with each other. Um let's say it starts at 10K. Whenever we ran the VSSL fun uh and it was organic like it still didn't convert very well. The moment we had all the leads sign up for like the weekly webinar, they do it live so it's a hustle. A lot of people don't like doing them. uh live but the those calls that come from the webinar like after listening to you live like it's so different when you are live on just a pre-recorded VSSL the intent of those people on the clos rate is like just way way higher than any VSSLs we see and we see that now now we start doing this for one of our business yeah but the guy asking this question can be really good at sales he could be and like weak at marketing or weak at tech and like you know that that's what I'm saying with like the best thing it's more like self assessing what you're good at not good at what what was your idea Ryan? Best organic. So depending on I mean of course all this can be depending on or or this or that or what is best to you but generally speaking if someone has consumed x amount of information already on you and consumption and consumption and consumption because they're watching long form YouTube or whatever they're basically teed up. So it is a very that's why a lot of the time these guys can run the simplest two p three-page funnel. So you could like Luke said DTA. So someone's going to a headline a short form VSSL again they've already consumed. So you can have the apply button right there testimonial wall all the things they fill out the application do your routing and do your qualification in that then they go book a call. I'm a huge fan of book a call. I think it's more agree with that. I think it's more evergreen. I mean it is more evergreen like inherently because if you do stuff like events or launches or whatever it's like if you're booking those to calls you need however many the volume that you need in sales availability on calendars when you do events that go to a calendar ising insane. you need like a lot, right? Like we know guys who do 30 40 sales reps that are like on hire to just come in for that and just come in to then set because then there's drop and like that just sounds like a mess to me. So evergreen organic, I would do it to a DTA unless you can make the offer sexier, which is like something that you have that's gated, that's free, that's low ticket, because you're going to get more people generally speaking to do that and get the next intention step down the line and then go into a book a call, right? But you can only do DTA if you have a like if you can tie a promise to your offer like I'll help you do X Y. No, I think with organic organic can be very little. Well, let's say they're consuming you. It's a bizop offer. Okay. But like promises and bizop are like super sketchy like you can't really like you get in a lot of trouble promising stuff. But if they're like really warm audience, I think you're right. Teed up like easier the better is probably a better place. like [ __ ] put them in your DMs and just get them on the phone. Yeah, I'm not a super fan of that DM, but a lot of people crush DM setting. So like I started talking to a lot of coaches and follower ads to DM. Yeah. Well, that's the same thing as that's what I was saying about the free group funnel. So you basically have like get them the next step in the consumption level or like with intention. So it's either they're DMing you now and there's communication, they're in a free school group, Facebook group [ __ ] they're doing something, they're w even the opt into a free training, but then there's so much more [ __ ] you need like automations, you need flows, you need this, you need that, you need to like get like just a mess versus if it's like simple, it's like this to apply, they apply, they qualify, they get on a phone call, and it's like we were talking to a guy at the event that has a 90 something% uh show rate and a 50% close rate on like a mid ticket over the phone because they're soing warm because they're coming. So, it really depends on a lot of things. We were both talking about paid funnels. Yeah. Yeah. So, all right. Next one on here. if you're getting uh started on a brand new publishing offer. So, which means like partnering with an expert or whatever basically. So, you're the marketer and you're partnering with someone who's like the expert. What would be your recommendations and tips for taking it to over a million ASAP? Um I'm going to let you start with that. I meant model. Yeah. Um me and a friend of mine that's like one of the best copyriters I know um have been thinking of yes client work great but we were like okay what can be a client that will make us a boatload of money and we started talking to some people like we put some criterias in place they are not probably very well defined but I would not try to go build an offer that like there's not already someone doing let's say let's say my goal is a billion% like my first thing like yeah if there was no one having that offer at a million a month. I would not take that client on. Is he talking about a million or a million a month? Uh I'm just going to say I'm sure, but I'm just going to say let's sprint to a million. Maybe say a million month. Same. I mean same [ __ ] It's one's just like how fast like you know. Um if there's not anyone there, I need to see what's the organic already like cuz like you really want to take a publishing offer. One of the easiest thing like oh it depends. Is he asking in the case of like you you know the offer and you just need an expert in the space or do you is he already an expert in the space? he makes some sales, but like you want to take him to that. So, usually these publishing offer guys are like, "Oh, I found this expert and I know I could figure out something." So, I'm sure they have some ideation that's already occurred around what the offer is, but they they generally speaking, they'll have some like audience already because they're an expert and whatever a little bit, not some massive audience. Some of these guys snipe like guys who have, you know, 300,000 or girls, whatever that, you know, a big following but have no monetization like offer model. Um, so yeah. What do you think? it was the what was the first thing that I would do? Yeah. If you're just getting started, what would your recommendation and tip be to scaling it to a million ASAP? Um, my recommendation and tip, depending on where the person is at and what they and what they understand. This is hard without context. No, you did it. You did it. What I would do is I would, you know, uh, context here. Luke did this exact business model and then I came in as essentially like number four or five. So Luke took somebody that was uh had no following really and then but was like an expert like a true expert in the niche and did this model except we fumbled and bumbled our freaking asses off to get to where we are today in that. So like based on those learnings how would you launch that now? Same way you talk about your XYZ new idea. How would launch it now? You know build figure out the message the market make sure there's a big problem number one. Make sure the person's good on camera. Uh, start with like the sales message in my opinion. So like some sort of VSSL, get that right. Use it on organic if they already have an audience. Um, and then once that's working, begin to build out everything. So then you start to build out the funnels and you start to build out, you know, customer support, sales team, make sure fulfillment's all good. They have to be in fulfillment. Um, and yeah, you know, yeah, that was key is in the beginning it was in fulfillment. Whether that's in product like pre-recorded fulfillment or that's like sell first for sure and then do it. But like either in there or the coaching, it's generally really helpful to be able to sell the person and like their expertise directly in the beginning. Um, the other piece that I was I completely agree. I always model everything. So like if I was to do this right now and I've talked about this on here and I always use as the example, but the life insurance one I would pick like I know three or four that already do it. I would go bump bump bump. I would have a little hedge. Actually, I would probably have multiple experts unless I found someone who's like a rockstar because I don't want the hedge of doing that, which when you're starting is probably harder, but and I would just run a gambit. I know three of them that crush it right now. They have one of them that's organic, one of them that's all paid, one of them it's a mix, which is hilarious. Um, and yeah, and they just absolutely crush it. So, I would just literally take what they do. I would model it off there. I would create the brand asset that made it look like it was, you know, polished, even though you don't even need that. And then I would just run it right off again. So, exactly what they're saying. I can add one last thing. Um, make sure you agree with them for them to keep pushing organic, especially in the first month because one of let's say most cases those people either run some ads or like or like no ads at all. So the moment you start spending on ads cuz like that's probably how you'll uh try to get the offer to work if they do not push organic and did not get sales consistently end like the relationship is just terrible. Yeah. No, agreed. Um I Josh Gavin I always [ __ ] plug him in this so shout out him. He owes me like 30% of his business. But um just kidding Josh I love you. Um but he does this exactly. He has an entire framework on how to do this. We actually talked with him like he almost in my opinion I've said this to him but like doesn't I feel like he has such good ones like that he's partnered with or built that he could take it so much further on like one or two of them versus having so many but he like both teaches people how to do it and then has some of his own. He owns all the IP. He owns the everything. It's literally the experts like part of it and it's a great business model. So I mean run it but you could probably find some resources from him too. So um next one there was probably YouTube more. How are you leveraging AI to better inform your media buying strategies? Oh okay that's a pretty good question. Um I am not doing let's say the dayto-day on this but um Vlad and other guy they've been producing with creatives non-stop. Yeah, I mean for for you guys as well like when we don't want to necessarily ask Lara to do something like just go like I can probably pull Slack right now the travel plague we have like 10 ads that were down like last couple of days just with AI generation. Mhm. You guys have a dedicated Slack channel in our Slack channel. No, like a two-way uh like me, him, and Vlad. Yeah. See, it's got to change. Got to change. We need eyeball. You you you Blake and Vlad. Yeah. Yeah. See, that's got to change. This is where we learn this [ __ ] I hate when people have this happened like three times in the last two months. People talk about something and they have a direct message between like two people or I'm sorry like three people or like six, seven people and I'm like make it into a channel. Put us in it. I'll mute it, but I I want eyes. Okay, fair enough. So, uh Blake, sorry for uh telling everyone that we have our own channel. Maybe that's considered micromanaging. It's probably considered micromanaging. Maybe I need to grow. Um we do a lot of the copy uh now with AI like whenever like we take a new project like we have let's say a warrior babe um project file in our DVD. You said the company name. Yes. Uh oh you're totally fine. Okay. Um, we produce copy like Blake sometimes ask like, "Hey, can we do this ad here?" But like try the strategy where we have like 21 ad copies and like in the normal scenario like it would take us, I don't know, um, two or three hours to produce 21 like a couple minutes and like we just revise everything. Good because we prompt the AI so well and give him all the context on the off like all the little details and like we don't give all that information like just freaking throw it one time like you talk with the AI in the beginning just make sure all the points are good from there spits copy so okay so that's copy that's creative what about actual media buying because I've seen Vlad send us stuff where it's like reporting or like finding quick things and I I have one on this but what about actual media buying um most of the stuff we do is exports from then experts from Facebook and combine that data Um, we don't have like AI agents yet. Even if Mark is like, "Dude, like I don't get it. Like, why you still do media buying?" Like, "You can have AI manage everything." But it's like, "Yeah, well, it's not it's not as simple." You're like, "Mark, you pay me to do media buying. What do you mean?" It's not as simple just because when you have third party tracking system in like most cases like Hyros is there like it's so hard to actually make sure the data is correct and like it's pulled the right way and like decisions are made the right way. Um, especially when we manage how much we manage a day like whatever let's say I c spend 30 50k a day like it's so risky to just give it to AI yeah like those people are paying [ __ ] done and like we don't want to delegate that um one thing that I saw some media buyers do they just have alerts like on the the agent always analyzes the data and if one of the KPI like I don't know CPM skyrockets or your caser call just tanks like you get an alert so like you have eyes on Like that's probably something we would do. Yeah. I was on uh uh Nick Fischer, shout out, he's a [ __ ] legend. Um but he was talking about it like two weeks ago. I was on one of the calls with him and he talked about I think it's that magics or whatever that thing is. So I don't know how much cuz they've had those forever like the automated reporting and same thing like the action flows, the rules, the all that stuff. Um, but there's some layer, and I'm not familiar with this because I don't actively media buy right now, but the they have a ton of [ __ ] set up in there that does like alerts and like auto turn offs and like does things and it also pulls data from other sources. So, it's like a twofold. Um, but they use that um on let's just say very very large like you know nine figure info companies. I didn't use matrix in a while but their integration with always used to suck. Yeah, that's that was like my thing. Ah, for the guy. Yeah. Yeah. because like he needed higher data to trust on the page. Yeah, I don't know their data sources on it, but he was like sharing all the stuff and had like nine tabs open. Yeah. So, all right. Um, next one on here in ecom. I've always thought about it. That's 95% product and creative. Okay. Well, 95% 95% product and creative and then 5% is media buying campaign setup or whatever. Would you agree or disagree and why? Great products with great creative seem to always do well regardless of media buying strategy, but I may be overlooking its importance. So there's a whole like clicking the buttons versus Right. Yeah. What do you think on that? [Music] Yeah. I I'd say like pro I think like what product and creative definitely is important, right? And uh if creative means like matching a market with a good message that resonates with it. I think that's always more important. As you begin to spend more, you have more, you know, that has to happen inside ad accounts with like, you know, overseeing stuff like that. that but I think yeah 100% you have to basically basically what he does it's useless no no you have to have good market good message resonance you have to have a good product of course and then like you know if you really hit a really good one you have a big tailwind um yeah so I agree with like the sentiment of the question yeah I do not agree with the ratio of importance 955 yeah cuz we have like one of my closest friends I was telling yesterday at the gym. uh has like a ecom brand that probably very soon he'll do like 2 million pounds a month uh in the UK and he does Amazon does Tik Tok shop but never cracked ads then now all of his ads are actually the winners from the like from their Tik Tok shop campaigns like the winners they run them as ads like dude like why do they print so much money on Tik Tok but they're not printing here it's like do you want me to give you one more try on Facebook because like they had a lot of agencies with the same creatives and we are crushing ing it and all the other agents with the same exact ads didn't do anything. H. So maybe like 7525 but then but then like but then like if something's set up fundamentally wrong it could be completely like if you like you know if you're like 5%. Yeah. I don't know if it's time. I don't know if it's focus. I don't know what percentage optimization. We we had a call the other day with we have friends that do 15 million a month with essentially one hero skew and they have like a couple ancillary stuff but they are crushing in like MRR game and he literally was like we have one media buyer who pops into here and like it is he basically was the 5 to95 approach like in his mind right you know and again he already knowing how to do it though like you have to [ __ ] know how to do it like setting up the account correctly having your pixels correct they were doing crazy [ __ ] with like not not day partying necessarily, but like they were like same day. They were almost like uh what do you call it? Uh what surfing? They were almost like surfing in there. Yeah. He's like, "Oh, we'll turn off this and this and then we'll ramp into these and find these pockets." And they're spending across Tik Tok, um Facebook, I'm sorry, Meta, and a little on Google. I'm sure on Google, but yeah, that was the two course. So, okay. Um yeah, we I talk about on here all the time though. If there is a landing page, for example, that is the ugliest, worst thing ever, but has the best offer or copy or whatever on it and the [ __ ] button doesn't work to purchase, but you have your address on there, people will mail you to try to buy your [ __ ] You know what I mean? Like, it kind of gets out of that. So, truly, yeah. Or Naval has the quote like, you know, you only need whatever mark. I don't know. I'm going to botch this, but it's like you only need uh sales if you if if your product's not good enough, you need sales. If your sales isn't good enough, you need marketing or whatever it is. But basically all to say like if your product's so [ __ ] good that you don't even need marketing and sales then yes like that's the number one thing. So next on here for the people without metar is there any truth in page BM and ad account trust scores that affect your CPMs? If so when is it time to shift pages ad accounts and BMs and signs from something external um that is ex uh or signs something external is affecting your ads other than its natural performance. Had a friend of mine switch ad accounts and performance improve. So wondering your thoughts on extern external factors. Love your work. Ryan, Luke, and M. Yeah. Um, it is all three names. Thank you, brother or sister. No, like literally, it's probably a sister. It's a It's a tough question just because we have some other accounts where, for example, the page health was trash. It's like, okay, let's spin up this other pages um that like we would manually farm the game. Start at the front. So which ones can you see? You can see page quality. You can see account quality. Can you see account? Can you see and you can see ad page quality and account quality. If you're going business support home like that that will show like how many ads rejected you have like if your account is at risk. Um and most of the time when we try to change those assets like it never changes anything account. Yes. Like let's say in terms of oh like I launched my CPM was 200 bucks and I I went through this whole rabbit hole and trying to figure out like why the CPM is so expensive and it's almost every single time the creative or the copy on the landing page like if Facebook thinks like whatever you're doing there like ah sketchy whatever like they will give it the most expensive CPM but like I I tend to look now at CPM like as such as a vanity metric because I really care about like how much it costs for someone to land on my page like per outbound click. So as long as that one's in line and I have one campaign has 200 CPM but at the other like 20 but the cost for outbound click is the same. I don't really care about what my CPM is and you optimize around I mean your true true your rorowaz obviously. Yeah, like everything the highest tracks will be like the metrics I guide myself in. All the Facebook ones are vanity metrics, but we have for example a lot of trading offers and the CPM on them is like 200 bucks and everyone panics like the guys coming the account like guys like what are we doing wrong? The CPM is 200. It's like yeah but your customer buck is like four bucks for an offer that's 15k. Yeah. Have you run a lot of trading offers? A couple. Have you? Mhm. Trading boss especially. So like direct to car um trading boss like you sell the license for about 15k. Interesting. Yeah. So it's direct application qualified people that have 50k. I had I had Ahmad on here um Amed I'm sorry Amad on here and uh he we was just at the event. You guys got to connect. He does all organic but he crushes and he only does this. Is it trading offer or he only does trading offers? No, no, he's not a he's not a trader. He's like a he's like a growth operator style which I'm butchering probably what it's called. Um but yeah. And then he So if you're watching this one, hit me up where I'll like the girls are that that were sitting next to you at dinner yesterday. Those like he they're a client. Oh, okay. I remember. Um yeah, my I I hang out with some lead genen guys or have really in the past and they'll swap all of these if I'm being honest. So they will have mult like it's every variable. It's the credit card that's on file. I mean it's both like a risk of the accounts too. So it's the credit card on file. It's the ad account. It's the pixel. It's the links the domain. It's the uh copy on the lander. It's the creative. Like it's literally everything could be a variable. If you're running like normal stuff though, yeah. I mean test swapping them out. I don't know why you wouldn't. Yeah. And dedicate and just like if you have two different ones, literally load the same stuff into the next one. Does it perform the same? Like it's very common to test that before you need to go and try and test everything. It's like if you're doing everything, you know, basically to the book, which everyone tries to do, most of people try to do everything to the book, but like just swap out an ad account, swap out swap out a page. And then that's the other thing. It's like rather than even having the question, it's like just just in one hour get a new ad account set up and cross it off the list. And yeah, and optimize for like uh like optimize for rorowes. Like we know people who have $300 whatever $250 CPMs that like the rorowaz still backs out and it's like obviously not super ideal if like you know in comparison, but like who cares? Like why would it matter? So um next one more of a marketing question. Yeah. Uh, how to increase your front-end AOV for a product where quantity breaks don't make sense compared to an easily bundable bundleable product. Aside from positioning it through gifting, raising price, adding free gifts. Uh, example, the Nuru foot massager compared to say a security camera that would make sense to have multiple. Like, how would you position it to triple the front end AOV? So, something that's really like a one-time thing that doesn't make sense to have more than one directly. How do you do that? Um, do you do any of that? Do you have that conversations with people about that stuff? No, but we actually have two clients now that that's very relatable for um most of the time it's about the funnel that they run. Like most people run like the side of ecom is like you just run to your Shopify their like product page where um you run the traffic to the Shopify uh main page. But the main main way I'm seeing people have like crazy high is the process you take the prospect first. So if I'm sending traffic first to like a VSSL and we're running the ads for like we're trying to figure this out like why I'm not sure like why it's so freaking hard. Um but like one of the biggest offers on ClickBank. It's a supplement offer. We're running the ads for them and all the traffic is being sent to your VSSL and after that VSSL like we offer bundles. the biggest one and the most taken one is eight bottles of that freaking supplement which is what like six month offer or three month offer I think it's six months. So our AOV is about one is very common by the way which I actually didn't realize until like a year more of the same like more of the same. So he's he's basically saying the opposite of that. He's saying it's something that isn't more of the same. Well, if it's not more of the same than something tertiary, like something that makes sense to have with a foot massager. Maybe there's like a [ __ ] oil or like a a hand massager or like a neck massager or like a neck handed foot massager super pack the premier version. No, like the my simpleton brand right now and I've only run a little bit of ecom said something so inappropriate. Uh my only like is is literally just like the exactly what they're saying the funnel type. So like all the post-purchase stuff that's either that's ancillary, that's the next step in the journey, that's the add-ons, that's the whatever because it doesn't just have to be on page and positioning as gifting and just more of the same. Like you can have all other SKs like that company I was talking about that does 15 million. Like they have their hero skew. It's all their creative. It's all their everything. They run to that, but the only amount that is going to ever occur on the first page of the checkout or the first order directly is going to be whatever it is, 50 bucks or whatever dollar value. Then there's post-purchase upsells. I don't I'm pretty sure at this point they don't do pre purchase because again that affects like conversion rate and stuff and I don't 100% know and you can play with that but like the post-purchase [ __ ] is just like increase AOV add-ons that don't ever affect a guide like a foot guide. Yeah. 100% margin. Um yeah, if it's um we we talk about with Mark about this triple your AOV is wild. That's what he said. I mean, triple your AOV because actually I think he'll listen to my first answer and he'll be like, "Dude, but that's not what I'm looking for because like you cannot really sell more foot massage uh like whatever those are cuz like you probably need one, right?" So, probably the only way you would increase your You get one for a friend. Well, that's what you said without doing it through gifting, raising price and gifts, free gifts. But why not tertiary products? tertiary products and but why not increase your price cuz like maybe if you have a VSSL to like induction them so good or like an adverttorial page to like the copy is so good like you can probably charge more for the same exact that's true I did a drop shipping fund test at the end of 2024 and I did like 100 grand a month and uh hardwood floors or what was it floors or something no it was like a dog product and uh I had I got one of those Shopify apps that did split testing on page for prices and or not on page just split testing in general. Um, and I tested like whatever $79 and I tested one at like $119 and it's in it's insane. It tracks like the full throughput and then also like the AOV stuff on the back on the upsells and like total total card amount and it obviously had like a lower take rate, but it actually one of the tests I did had such a vast thing and it was like basically showed it as premium instead of making it like more commoditized and it actually had a better return. So, we ended up landing on the one that was hundred and something dollars. But again, very small test, but like you just got to test stuff like that. And then I I agree tertiary stuff is is the obvious way, the obvious way. Um, and any any MR function, I don't know how gray area you want to be, but you can do subscription stuff. Uh, you can do community based stuff that's included in there, depending if it's community, it could be community focused. Uh, you can do add-ons for shipping stuff that's the same ship. You know, you can do a lot of ways to do that. But I mean, one of the biggest ecom hacks that I know of um is whatever your uh whatever your product is, just sell it and don't ship it. I I heard it increases margins a lot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, that's a great advice. Yeah. Um you heard it here first. Ecom question. Oh, another ecom question. Okay. Um I'm sure you've answered this before, but how to handle the fluctuations in results, especially when you're testing on [ __ ] campaigns? Example, you test a VSL for three days at $100 and you have a 1.5K 1.5x KPI per day and then 20 to 30% net each day. So you bump to 200. Okay. So you're basically consistent for three days at 100 bucks the next day. So you bump it to 200 and for another from 100 100. Yeah. 20% net each day. Yeah. So you bump to 200 results tank. It's a very large TAM and the offer with large TAM script hook targeting. So not sure why increase in spend has such a large drop off. What factors could cause such steep performance decline when doubling test budgets? So yes, he was doubling his test budget after three days. I mean, first one, I'm actually not um disconidering doubling budgets when you're spending only 100 because the budget is not even that big. Um there might be a couple of things like one, your ad account is not actually primed to spend huge amounts. So probably one thing you can do if you can afford it, try your test at a higher budget so you don't have to increase every single time because I I met a couple of guys recently that their whole philosophy on running ads was if a campaign works don't touch the budget like just let it run and like make your changes at the ad level like if something tanks but don't change the budget which in some accounts makes so much sense because like I I know exactly like the type of accounts you mentioned because like sometimes like you bump the budget like 50 bucks and like it goes to [ __ ] and it was like a winner the day before like the week before like the first budget bump you have like it just tanks. So like if you're seeing that behavior a lot in the account, try some of your tests at the bigger budget or let's say if your campaign runs super well at 100, maybe just duplicate that campaign and try it at the budget you want to increase it without cannibalizing the first one. That's an option. And for if you if that doesn't work, try to change the ad copy at the creative level just so you don't have overlap. We asked uh Blake this when he was on, but what is like your overall like creative to scaling process like testing to scaling? Um like you're launching I mean I don't want to say but I mean [ __ ] a fresh account like what's your campaign structure? What's your launch strategy to creative once you find winners? What do you do with them? Do you scale them? Do you launch a different campaign that's scale campaigns or like proven? Usually the structure we have recently is creative testing campaign, copy testing campaign with the winner creatives and we just try to squeeze as much juice out of that one as possible. And probably in most of the accounts we run right now. Those are like some of the best performing campaigns. the copy testing with the existing winner creatives scaling campaign which is usually like just a CBO structure uh like one open adset one look alike of your like purchasers uh and just slam all your best performing creatives in there um and then sometimes we just do weird tests but like does don't necessarily have like some deep meaning but we just test for the sake of testing because like some of the most random tests like work the best. Yeah. What's your biggest account right now you're spending daily? It dropped a bit. It used to be 100K, now 70K a day in ecom. So, um, low ticket front end actual product. No, really. Mhm. All right. We need to talk about that. Um, all right. Next one. I want to build an info product course. We're getting into a couple days ago now, so or kind of yesterday. Uh, I want to build an info product course teaching other agencies how to sell and fulfill high ticket web design. Can you spitball on this idea what you do to offer as an order bump Otto ascension? Should I just make a school? I' I've done my math and I think it works. How can I test this idea to see if it has legs about building the entire funnel products and putting a ton of money into it? So, he wants to take he wants to basically create a course, not coaching, uh, to teach agencies how to do high ticket web design. So, how would you launch it? Is it with a low to get funnel? It sounds as it because I think he's assuming because it's direct to cart because he wants to do just a course instead of coaching which honestly in my opinion is actually or you go ahead actually you go ahead if you're trying to test the idea. I mean, yeah, you're trying to test the idea to see if it has legs without building an entire funnel products or putting money into a ton of money. The most obvious thing would be see if somebody's already doing that and if someone's ads have been running for a long time, then you know it works. And then uh and then yeah, then build out all the marketing first. I would say rather than building out the whole entire thing and then it never even working, no one even wanting it. Try with you know the marketing, the sales, the pages, the ads. See if that works first and then if it does then build it. Yeah, literate funnels too. Like if you try to build them from scratch are a freaking beast. Like it's not that easy. It's probably easier to figure out the VSSL funnel than get fun, dude. I talk about it all the time on here. I was like I would I don't think I would ever launch low ticket first for the amount of iteration and back and forth and trying to get it right and the pieces and parts it requires, the assets on page. Like I hate that stuff. So I would do I would honestly do a callunnel is what I would do. % 100% I would do and I would probably do a DTA because you get more volume for a cheaper cost. Uh which does not necessarily mean a good thing because they likely have lower consumption if they go through other funnels, but you need to like talk to people and like be able to have the room for error and noodle room to like to be able to do it. Get people on the phone that are in your market as fast as you can and then rather than guessing what they want, you're just talking to them. Yeah. And so because you're teaching people because you want to build an info that teaches other agencies, which is very interesting, uh how to sell and fulfill. So the beauty of having a a niche like that is you also don't necessarily have to run ads. Uh it's way easier to do something like outreach. Um I don't know if I like that idea to be honest. What outreach? No, it's like having agencies. He doesn't like your idea. Um I Yeah. Well, it's like cuz then the agency has to I mean maybe it makes it really easy for the agency and it's an add-on and it's a good idea. what I think is irrelevant. I could be completely [ __ ] wrong. And the other side of this is if you have a great fulfillment team, it could almost you could just do this as a partnership thing and you could teach other agencies how to sell it and then you could fill spread. Yeah. That would be the way to do it because then there's no increase for them. Yeah. So, you have a sexier offer because it's like, hey, it's basically white labeling you guys as a service. You're teaching them how to sell it. You show them the benefits of it. You show them how much money they can make on it. And then for you sell it to them for five, they sell it to their client for 10. And then it costs Yeah. They sell for whatever they want. And then you make the spread there. Yeah. And then you get more efficient with that and you just become the fulfillment god of, you know, these websites. Very very good take on this. I know someone not in the web design space but has a one of the biggest SEO agencies. Yeah. Oh, you know. No, no. I just I've heard of this before. I almost did this like [ __ ] probably eight years ago now. This carpet was made to get ash. We were at We were at agency founders and when the guy I mean the company is called Search Atlas like I can do some free promo. Um, and they have two options. So, they are they're one of the biggest SEO agencies out there. And offer number one, they build a software like an AI software, whatever that like makes it so easy for you to fulfill on SEO. So, that's offer number one. They just teach you how to use their software. They have courses. They do like weekly, monthly coaching. Um, the second thing is like, yeah, you learned this, but you're too lazy, but you can definitely upsell your existing clients to do SEO work for them. You just white label them. Yeah. But yeah, like they they run ads to get people on like to teach them how to make money with SEO like as an upsell. So it's pretty much the same exact thing. Just your thing is website design. I would do that. I like that idea. Especially if you're talking about fulfilling on high ticket, high ticket, and all this stuff is like premium, and then you're trying to sell some low ticket thing and like a send that like I Yeah, cuz if you're going to if you're going to try and sell something that's like mid ticket essentially, which is like, you know, a 1 to 2k style offer anyway, it's going to be something that is more you're going to need like a a bigger process. You're going to need a webinar, you're going to need VSSL, you're going to need to go through that whole thing. So, let's start there. Next one. What's your follow-up process look like? Uh like duration, no show, all of that. Um, I'm I'm starting to get in a couple days back, so I actually might cut this here soon. Um, yeah, because the rest of these are all questions basically for me, and I don't really want to Yeah, these ones don't really make sense for these guys here. So, all right, we'll wrap it at that. Um, or actually, let me see if there's one more in here. I have a good follow-up process. What's your follow-up process look like? Duration. So, after no show, we dial them. We text them every single day for 30 days straight. Example, like what? So, what's our follow-up process look like? Sorry, people walked in here. I think the key the key with follow-up process is just having one. You know, it sounds sounds sounds oversimplified, but just like having a process and then people way underestimate how important the systems and processes you have once you have and paid for a lead are. Like it's like, you know, hypothetically it's like it's like, oh, we're good at ads, but like all of our ads would [ __ ] break immediately if we didn't have all of this [ __ ] behind it where, you know, you're squeezing all of the juice out of the lemon. Like, so, you know, I would say just, uh, aim on having more than you think you need. Uh, and then just cover all the fronts. So, all the obvious ones. And you can just think logically like if you want someone to get on a call, they probably should have a text for that like on like the data part of the reminders. If you want to warm them up, like there's nurture sequences. So in between the point of when they book a call and then when they get on the call, sending them lots of content, testimonials, videos like that. Um you know, there's there's Yeah. So aim for more than you think that you need and then just try and cover all of the things like look around. what are all the best practices and then just put them all in there because it's really important and I would probably try to funnel hack companies that rely heavily on ads and that are super successful. Those people have their flows dialed in 100%. I mean we yeah we were in courses and funnel hacking and whatever is how we initially got like the bones of all of ours and then you have to obviously change it to your niche or your you know messaging but and then so if you to get technical for you so like if it's VSSL optin funnel you have an optin you have an application you have a book a call and then you have like when the call actually happens and then you have the sale right so I don't have enough fingers but um if so if you go if you go through so we'll have an automation for each layer right so somebody who uh opts in but doesn't apply someone who applies but doesn't book, someone who books before they get on the call, someone who no shows on the call, and then somebody who's, you know, pending or whatever in the deal stage layer. So those are basically across those, you have contextual ones for them for that or promises that you gave them. So if they were at the BSL is like, oh, we're going to, you know, send you bonuses or gifts or whatever. Contextual, contextual. Then on top of that, the reason you do stuff like email, um, and I'm, it's actually the next question, I'll read it, but someone else asked, and this directly connects, um, I've been learning a lot of Alex Becker's content. He advises against using an or he advises to use an opt-in page for high ticket offers. High ticket to cover the ad cost and then make money from the email list. In his words, averaging one to two dollars per email per user for the email list for the month. You use a similar funnel. Did you find that that works? Did you guys make money off the list? Okay. So, one I don't I I please send me this content because I don't know where Becker would use that. It's like that's like affiliate lead genen language usually. Um and you wouldn't want your high ticket to cover your ad costs. It's like it just doesn't sound really direct. But in saying that, high opt-in for high ticket, the reason that we do it or why it really works for us is like exactly what Luke said. So like if we didn't have any email automations, everything would explode because we are capturing the email so that we can do all those contextual automations and then also email them twice a day, every single day, seven days a week for a very long time. Uh sending them content pieces. And for us, we optimize by sending them content pieces that are on the site. And the site itself is like a web of content. So they go for one thing and then once they're there, there's like recommended ones that are similar to this. Uh we do the same thing on text where we'll send them to the site and do things that are contextual to them. So we're constantly pushing them there for consumption because you have their email which is like the smallest level of intent. I mean I guess a click is before that the uh intent then they give the email and then we do all that versus if you go to an application or something you like push them down further. So that's my opinion. Um, hey, not going to read that part out loud. Uh, quick question for someone who runs deep in op space. When you're hiring a real a players, media buyers, real a player, media buyer, especially for YouTube, what are the biggest things you look for? Does industry experience matter? Meaning someone who's crushed a training offer? Do you think that translates well over to like an ecom coaching? Uh, how much weight do you place on platform results versus broader skill? Um, like CRO instincts, funnel diagnostics, etc. Uh, do you expect buyers expect buyers to write the copy themselves or do you or do you have someone to spot? This is like all broken up. Sorry. Um, any red or green flags you've learned to look out for? So, essentially trying to dial in their standards on how they're going to hire for media buyers, which is perfect. And this was asked before I was even here. So, what do you guys think on that? Um, I think, you know, you need to have all of the parts covered. So, you got to have someone who's good at like thinking like CRO, ad copy, creative, and then also media buying. Um, and then it depends if you know how to do it or not, right? If you don't know how to do it, they need to know how to do it. Um, and then in that case, the best thing is always having someone who's already done it, right? Like if you can find someone who's working on, I don't know, 30 other accounts or something like that and they're running Google, you know, and they're doing it successfully and they can pop open or show you just results, you know, you you know they know what they're doing and then figuring out like where their uh capabilities start and stop and then, you know, just addressing it. If if someone's can do it all, then you got someone who who can do it all. And if you have someone who's just a part, then you got to fill in the other parts. So depends on what you know and then what they know and then you know my my take in hiring is we want to try and find people who are already doing it successfully. What about you? I mean you hire media buyers for your team and then you guys act as media buyers for companies. So like one where do you guys draw the line on like what you He can teach them really well though. Yeah. Yeah. Exact. Yeah. That I mean you know like all of our best guys like start pretty much from zero. Yeah. Uh because main thing for me is like to go from zero to one like that one's probably the the most complicated part until like they understand the platform all that stuff but for them to just become super technical analyze the data like that that one I can like I can teach someone to be like top tier talent like we were talking yesterday about like legion but even in the info space info is like very contextual and like you need to understand a lot of strategy until you can be a good media buyer yeah he asked that so like the difference between someone being ecom coaching and training offer so I guess I guess those are both info kind of but like what do you think about info to ecom buyers? It's very different. Very different. Yeah. For direct to cardart essentially if you run ads for an info product you need to understand the strategy super well cuz like if you don't know what to look at like which numbers like what's your actual KPIs what you optimizing for like where do you see the funnel is broken like how do you report it to the client that I think that's super important. the more I think about oh like do you want your media buyer to write your copy uh like help you with the strategy help you with the angles I think media buyers that are really good at buying media but then also are very good at writing copy are like super rare like Blake or Mark they're they're like some of those rare examples when like I can do it all but even in my case like I'm working on my cop game I'm I think I'm pretty good at strategy I think I'm really good at strategy But I don't think I'm that good at copy. So where would So for someone like this, if they're hiring in and they want a media buyer, clearly that's the number one portion of the skill they want, right? Obviously that part's like non-negotiable, but how far I guess it's contextual in the person already, right? It's like you don't even know. You're not trying to find someone who also has this. I mean, you might, but like just look at it like marketing. like you need to find you need to sell marketing and then if that means a media buyer that if it means a media buyer that in my opinion that typically means that you already have the strategy and the creative and the messaging part figured out if if you know so you have to figure out marketing not just one thing but also if you get someone to agree to do for you the copy the angles and the media buying and then retainer wise you offer something super low I can almost guarantee you that yeah you're not getting something no anyone who can actually do do that well is extremely powerful. Yeah, they have the ability to make a lot of money. So, the an interesting thing just to kind of on overall hiring is I've talked about on here we're just now for the first time like hiring people that have hit bigger PRs that have done more like have more experience than we have in something. So, example like you know CMO like has done higher numbers than we have as a company and in the past majority of the company has like grown like we're always doing PRs together like we are always doing PRs together. we haven't done certain things until we've done them internally here. Um they're more expensive. They're like all, you know, go down the list of things, but there's a lot of pros and there's some cons. Um the event we were at uh was talking about how theirs is the exact opposite model. Um like, and again, we're only doing this at like the sea level. We're kind of doing it in other places, but like mainly at the sea level, but they talked about how they go from your approach and essentially like a couple of guys that were on very high level positions in their company were setters that like rose their way up and they teach them things inside there. It's just a different approach. Either is either works, either is right or wrong. The different like procons is like we're paying more, right, than somebody because like just the expectation and like the the growth that occurs when somebody is this in the company and then can grow to this is different than hiring outside talent or poaching or trying to find these people with experience because they either inherently are worth more or they think they're worth more or whatever. Um, so just something to think about. So yeah, I love what Luke said though because it's like you're just trying to plug the gap. Like if you're literally trying to find a medi buyer because you have the other things, find a media buyer. If you're trying to find like if you know, it depends on what you know and what you need for what your current setup is. So I think that's a good one. Um, next one is a novel. So this is all right. Let's rip it. Put it in chatbt. Summarize. No, because it has data. Um, we sell info coaching in the AI space. How to how to that's kind of funny. Uh, how to become a data scientist and how to build AI agents. Um, two mid to mid-t courses. It's pretty I need to buy it. It's pretty profitable on the front end and also around 10% of the midt buyers are buying high ticket. So it is pretty profitable on the front end which is great. Okay, so you're already liquidating fully. 10% ascension rate from mid ticket to high ticket. And I'm constantly thinking about how else we can monetize it. Right now it looks like mid ticket to high ticket. And some stats are we're spending $100,000 a month on the on the mid ticket with the 3x rorowaz direct to cart. Nice. Uh with the webinar funnel it's in the Polish market. We have $100,000 a month on ads and spend $400,000 a month in the US. I don't understand. Oh, spending $100,000 a month on ads is like spending 400k on the month in in the US. Like based on I assume like TAM, but uh we're testing 20 to 30 ads a day to keep the ad spend consistent. 10% of the mid ticket are ascending. Not ad spend costs here because we're upselling existing customers. Yes. Start uh started implementing set or closer strategy to call and follow up. People register the webinar but didn't buy. Booking them for calls to buy head ticket. love to hear your insights on how you think about squeezing the back end even more or utilize our lead flow even better. It's a good one. Yeah, I mean that that that was that was that's that's really it. Like you just have to understand you need to squeeze the squeeze what you have more and just go into it and just figure out every place that you're weak and try and work on that little piece for until it's better and then move on to another piece until it's better. Move on to another piece until it's better. And you know that would be you know high level how you how you make that better. And the other thing would be if you can just increase the ascension rate. Uh obviously that would be huge. Um 10% is super high already though. 10% is mid ticket to high ticket. Uhhuh. So Oh, mid to high. That's not high. Low to low to high. That's that's Yeah. Double high. Yeah. But for Can we do another sparkling water, please? Another one. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. sparking water refill. Um, all right. So, if you go back to the episode that Brooke Hadink is on, he is a class example of this. There's other I don't want to say names. He said his own stuff, so I feel comfortable saying his, but there's other people who do this. They will run mid-t webinar and theirs is a 1 to 2k ticket and they will have a 20 to 45% ascension rate and they do it on the onboarding call. So, like globally to look at this entire thing, if you you need to map everything. So, you need to map front to back. So it's like what is your webinar conversion? What is your like go through the steps every single one map every single one out with every single conversion rate and then once you have them all mapped out it's pulling each one up 1 2 3 whatever and then backing out on the very very end what's LTV right now right and then what's CAC and then do that math and then do your percents across and then find your lifts. So like the one the one piece of it that I was talking about there was making it so your onboarding call or your implementation whatever call that you have get a higher take rate on that whether that's through the sales script whether that's getting more people on the call getting more people to show like either show on the call or book the call like there are so many little conversion steps in between there that that one's a 20 you get to a 25 and the further forward you go in the funnel the and and the more tweaks you make here the more it affects the back end. So something as simple as getting a 5% more conversion rate on your registration page depending will back all the way out massively on what that the the change the LTV to CAC ratio. So like map that whole thing. You should DM me because this is interesting. So DM me on something and then and say that you came from here. Um but there's a million ways to squeeze and then if you're just thinking like big things, it's probably that one in my opinion. It's probably that ascension rate that you guys said, the mid to high because you can really hammer that up if the offer stacks right and then what the offer is structured like depending if you can uh introduce there's a ton of people here that were doing this that opens my mind uh some form of membership recurring something that you have on the back the middleback um or like two different things on the back. Uh, that's [ __ ] huge for LTV because you get a community going, you get a whatever going and you start a couple thousand bucks or whatever and that stacks so quickly and you get So I I would do that. But also, you can also just do more volume. If you're spending if you're getting 3x on the front, like that's pretty insane. So play with it and if it like drops down in half, like make sure your numbers back out to you actually are making more and you're not just doing more work for the same or less because that's [ __ ] not ideal. But I would do that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey Ryan, watch a bunch of your videos. Thanks for the valuable content. I've seen you recommend go publish to go publish a creator and build out systems for them. Uh I'm a total beginner and I see so many necessary skills to stack. What would be your fir Okay, so I'm going to change this question, but essentially what would be and ask you guys, what would be the first skill to stack in order to begin this online journey? Basically, the first skill copy. Think copy. Um, this is very is highly debated, completely unique to the person by the way. But yeah, I agree. Highly debated, completely unique. Like I think you got to assess what are you naturally kind of good at. Like I think the idea that you have to have everything yourself is not true. You can build a team. So like if you're [ __ ] dog [ __ ] with, you know, technical stuff, then like you can find somebody to help you with that. Um, right. But how how do you go about the positions that are not let's say when it comes to like let's say a tag position automation position like if something's done right you say it if it's done not done right you say it right away but when it comes to a copyriter let's say you do go to publishing model and you want to hire that copyriter like if you don't know [ __ ] about copy like the copy can be terrible but like to it sounds good. That's true. That's true. So, if you're trying to make a career out of this, you got to just pull your pants up and just learn it all. To be honest, pull them up. Yeah. Pull your pants up and just learn it all. Start just start anywhere. I would say probably the best would be just follow your interest at the beginning. Like what are you more interested in figuring out is it marketing and ads or is it sales and go super deep into it until you're good enough and then move on to the next thing and the next thing and then if there's anything that you're really not good at, try and find somebody to work with. In my opinion, if I was running like uh you know where I was doing like a ton of this, I would want a team of course. You know what I mean? So, but if like one thing in this whole in the sentence in the question was I'm a complete beginner. Like if you are a complete beginner, I would not start with publishing offers. No. If I I say this on here, my my two things are you either get paid to do it or you pay to do it, right? So, you're either going to buy a course and it is not going to be on learn how to copyright necessarily. It's going to be on some business model, some whatever. And it's going to be every piece of it, just a little. And you're going to get your feed into it. And it's going to be a little bit of tech because you're going to build a couple pages. It's going to be a little bit of sales because you're going to do sales. It's going to be a little bit of media buying or whatever traffic. Like it's going to be that. And then the other option is get paid to do it is you find a specific skill set role that someone is hiring for. Like a lot of ones are a setter that goes into a closer or something like that. And it's like you start in sales. But when you're in there, you understand and start like if you are aware of it or go into it with the intention and you work in some one of these, you see all the other pieces and you do that and you get paid to do it versus I like the other one. I like paying for it and then I actually paid to then and then did the other way, right? Like paid to do it and then started working with these guys and then learned it on the job like every almost everything is either through a paid course. Sure. Some like communities and stuff. um and then doing it literally doing the thing and it's not one specific like they have stacked obviously like skills just naturally stack but like it wasn't specifically like oh I want to learn this at that time at least so that was mine um what is your what's your show up workflow is the closer doing all the work if yes how are you tracking them and do you have triagers um I have a video on this where I talk about this it's called like just look up show rate just search my thing and search show rate but rate seriously yeah but I have one on this cuz and it changes all the time but like at that time the one that we were doing was like a 70s something% show rate and it includes setters it includes these different pieces. Um but the quick of it is all the automated reminders, all the automated emails, everything Luke was talking about with hitting them with content uh both in ads and in email and the other places. Uh the initial dial happens within one uh within like under five minutes where it comes from uh confirmation uh setter that they'll dial and confirm the call. Hey, just want to let you know, you know, this is a Zoom, you know, this is a whatever the time zone. Um, and then the automated texts that come will come from the closer automatically. So, we do make it framed from the closer. We also have some emails that direct come from the closer, but then any of the educational ones that are not like, "Hey, what's up, blah blah blah, like respond to me basically, uh, come from the company branded one. So, we'll use expert name for that." Um, and then the thank you page positioning is like really, really big. And we a lot of time point them back to the thank you page. We do have some dedicated pages that we point them to, but they're like pre-objection blocks that are not necessarily I mean I guess they are a function of it. So I have a whole video on this where I talk about it. So next one. Uh what skills do you think offer the highest leverage for a beginner to learn? I'm just starting out and make money. I've been spending. We already answered this basically. So same thing we said before skill building question. Does one still require? What? It says 1 hour there. Does this one still require man? If maybe not, man. Either way, we're close. So, all right. Either way, I think we're out of questions anyway. So, we just Is this yours? This is yours. So, we just hit maybe a cap on this. And if we did, and if we didn't, we don't know. So, Oh, no. It's going up now. It's now it's just in minutes. Oh. Oh, okay. So, we're going. These guys scared. These guys scared me. All right. Um I don't I don't think there's other ones in here. I mean, there are a couple, but is there any that's like like more about like like people and thinking [ __ ] Why is that what you know about? Yeah. Yeah, Luke has evolved to being people in thinking, which is honestly very fair. Um, I don't know. No, I mean, there's nothing specific to that. The I mean, those are all the questions from today. Now, I just have the ones that happen through the week. Let's do one more good one. They're all about they're the me, their tech stack, their ops, their automations, their tracking systems, their I'm a 20-year-old setter and how do I evolve into this? So, I'll get you guys on the next one and I'll make sure I get these on here. Um, any other closing questions, fun things? I mean, if you have something about people that you want to teach people about. What do you want to teach people about? Off the rip. Off the rip. Off the rip. Man, it's not really off the rip. You brought it up, you know. It's like, yeah, off the rip. So, let me look at my notes. Yeah. I would say like you know in like all these questions just like under like you know thinking of like thinking of like why you're asking the thing in the first place and then making sure you're like you know uh considering who you are and what you can do and what you're good at and what you're trying to do and whatever it is that you're trying to do. I think that people don't do that enough. It's like you look around you're like oh this person's doing this and there's money and then this is this and there's this funnel type and there's this this. But I think a lot of a lot of I think progressing in business is like what am I good at? What can I do? What do I understand? Um and yeah, can I ask you a question? Yesterday at the gym you said something that was really the opposite of what I was thinking. Yeah. Um like my perspective on like building a business like I first need to be freaking great at that specific thing like an absolute beast. Then I know like if I get people under me like I would have the respect from them cuz like I'm so good at the thing. But you said like oh like if I would have to start from scratch like I can build any business. Mhm. Even a business that's like I'm not an expert on and the my question was how and why do you think people do you agree with that first? Continue. Do you agree with it that I that we could build anything? Yeah. Yes. But I also know me and I know that I would literally But just just just just the concept the concept but how I would how I would approach it is probably different than I think how you would. Yeah. Because I would I would psychopath like let's say we pick whatever like I need to like become whatever it is. So if it's like whatever industry or niche like I need to understand it so well so that I can do what you're talking about like certain skills specific like yes I know enough about this or enough about this and generally speaking we probably do it like I think we understand at some level we only know this much but like we understand some of the fundamental stuff that it would translate but like whatever the industry specific is I would go so deep. Yeah. So deep. Yeah. like understanding like dude the respect the respect no not a good thing like the literal minute detail I would go to conferences I would watch every [ __ ] course every YouTube video I'd listen to every podcast where someone's talking about some nitty-gritty thing about a home service thing that is completely different that I wouldn't know about because I do think the respect thing is [ __ ] real yeah I I I think that um if I was in it if I was just someone can respect you without you having to have intricate details on what the thing is. Yeah. And that's what a little bit why you and I are different. But like also like I mean think like private equity play. It's like I don't you know they understand the math and they understand the business model and whatever. Do they understand maybe some minute detail? They make the most money out of everyone in the world. Yeah. But if we're talking about operating versus owning is different. So if we're talking about like owning it and owner operating it versus just like owning it as like you know a cash flow or whatever, it's just different. It just depends. But like I I I generally speaking approach things a little bit more like I need more information before I do something generally speaking than someone like you. Well, I definitely still need more information, want more information. I'm just saying like more more like the consumption level that I would go through is more. Yeah. I mean I like how I think of it is I would get all the consumption of the stuff that I needed to get the consumption on. But I think that like if you like if you want to build a company and then like you kind of know you can build a company because you understand the company or you understand like I mean you look at like an e-commerce business you look at like an info business you look at like whatever it's on the internet I think there's a lot of [ __ ] that's [ __ ] relatively 100% very the same businesses are people then you have operations you have marketing you have sales you have the product that's kind of the same thing everywhere um and then you know How I think of growing companies and businesses is like um first having a really big vision like that helps. You have to have the belief that you can build something big and then it's got to be big enough to where people that are talented can like fit into it and reach their own self goals like self-actualize inside of what it is that you're trying to do. And then you bring everybody together and then you know my frame of mind is always like how can I get everyone around me paid and successful and align incentives. And if you do that that drives human behavior. So if somebody has a skill set and the incentive is aligned and you just have hey here's a target destination and if everybody does this then there's these incentives that you all get that you all want. then you know you don't need to know you don't need to know a lot you know I mean like and here's the the other thing there is like I feel like I kind of know I know I know a good amount of of how [ __ ] how an internet company works so like that's part of where that comes from I always for whatever reason literally I said home services when I said my thing but like there's some industries where I'm like I have no idea but like internet business yeah it's there's a lot of so why a home service business is [ __ ] crazy is because of the internet part like that's how those things are scaling and then you just find someone who totally understands how to fulfill on the home service part. Bing, bang, boom. And then their rev share partner. There's no [ __ ] way in hell that they could get to where you were trying to get to without the internet part working and the CRM and the digital part and the sales part and the marketing part. And then it's like, hey, can you go build a $400 million flooring company that could sell without this? No. We need you to [ __ ] nail fulfillment. Boom. Yeah. So, he needs a full-on operator that actually understands the business and just wants to do the internet part and like the people on the team in the company side because Yeah, because you need someone who literally does understand all of the [ __ ] and like there is going to be this a little bit 100% if this person is having XYZ and oh my gosh and the show up or whatever and this person has to drive to the physical location and someone's car and like all this stuff like that doesn't matter once you're like here. Yeah. But that's just understanding one process and then an operator is just like making sure that one process is getting done. Yeah. And the 900 processes inside the process. Yeah. Which is the same as everything like there's 900 pro. So it's just another operator making sure process different than our current understand where you understand the actual thing too. I don't understand any of the coaching part. That's not true. And that and what we do. I mean like it's like I I like understand it but I don't know what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But like, and you also live and breathe it and do it and are physically XYZ and understand that stuff at an X level in our own in our own way. We're not we're not women with hormones, brother. We're not 40 years old and overweight. We're [ __ ] young and have testosterone and build muscle and just eat enough protein and then still are fine. So, this is a sneak peek into five minutes of every of six hours of every day. Um, thoughtful disagreement. I don't think we disagree. Yeah, we agree. I don't even think we disagree. We We agree there though. Yeah, I obviously lean more uh thinking about thing. Not thinking uh technical detail holdups, what could break, whatever. Luke thinks more vision big. Anything can work. People pay everyone over. I think oh we, you know, don't make as much margin because of this. Luke thinks everyone, you know, is true. Everyone makes great money that works with us and does that because of that. There's no one in the entire space that pays better than us. Yeah. Blended. No doubt that's an that's an ad for people to join us. It's not it's not wrong. It's not wrong. It's not wrong. It's not wrong. Which again hurts us at some level. Like we go in these rooms and these guys are making XYZ or doing this and it's like there is a portion of us. We had this conversation last night that's like you know we're we're almost like over complicating things or like doing a lot more to like make less than someone else. Like if you compare the amount of like actual like team size and like amount of meet and like all the stuff to make X number. It's like there's a lot of ways to get to a goal, but what we're trying to build is different than all of them as well and can go to a different layer than any of the other ones can go because of how we're building it. And it's fun because it's on hard mode. It's on hard mode and it's also stuff that translates like L said into any other thing we do. So it's like, oh, now we know how to do this thing. We're essentially getting paid to do it at some level, right? like to learn how to do it and like [ __ ] it up and then try it again and build a real company and build like a real Exactly. an off. There's, you know, everyone in the space like, "Oh, what offer are you running?" Or like, "Oh, what's this?" And it's like, "No, no, no, no." It's like, "We're not an offer." We're like, "That's classy." Uh, we're not. Yeah. So, it's like, but they make great money, but it's just not our goal. So, uh, that's all I got. Anything else specific? No. That was a great answer to the question. All right, guys. Uh, we are here. I don't know how many more days. Um, but yeah, that's that. So, six more I believe in. Catch on Twitter, on Instagram. loves shameless plugs. Uh yeah, I'll link them out on these. So, I will talk to you guys tomorrow. Hopefully this hopefully this one was helpful and if I missed your question in there, it's because it was too technical or too whatever. And I will go back to it and get it next week. So, thanks for watching. Bye, guys. Please.
