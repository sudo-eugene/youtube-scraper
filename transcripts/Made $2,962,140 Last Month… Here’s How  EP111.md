We made $2,962,140 last month in our info coaching business, which frankly is not good. And I'm going to break down what went right and what went wrong in marketing, sales, fulfillment, tech, finance, and ops. We're going to walk through the different marketing funnels, which ones are working, which ones are not working, and what we're doing to change them. And then we're going to go through the team efficiencies we found, how we're growing the team, and the overall org chart. I promise if you are scaling anything in info coaching, you will find a golden nugget in here that will be valuable to you. All right, last year we did 30 million in cash collected in this business. We've now crossed over 78 million. I think it's actually over 79 now uh in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is just for me to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale this business to over 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. Took this screenshot just before this. Um, so this was through yesterday. Today's July 1st. This is the entire month of June. 2.96 mil uh in cash collected in our Stripe account. All right. Now, I'm going to start with marketing on this. If you've seen other videos on the channel, you've seen me kind of talk through these. We're going to talk about what went right, what went wrong. Um, so starting with marketing in these pieces, the biggest piece of what's happening with marketing for us is or kind of overall with the entire department. So over here, we can walk through the department first. Um, so we have a CMO that is newer to us. So call it I believe it's three months now. Um, so he now leads this entire marketing department. In here we have a creative creative director that up until kind of more recent has more so focused on distribution than the actual front-end portion. Uh, ideation creation, a video editor. Uh, this this is actually brand new to us. This is like a full-time senior video editor that crushes with VSSLs and all that. We've always outsource that in the past. So, we now have one in-house so we can do constant uh, iterations and split tests. We have an editor that does all of the content uh, and a lot of the ads as well, or actually all of the ads as well at this point. Um, and I have other videos where we talked about the growth of this change and like kind of where we're at right now, but a graphic designer that came in in the last uh quarter. I'm going to talk a lot about quarters because the end of Q2. So, graphic designer that came in in the quarter, brand face lead is our top brand face co-founder. Um, so she is still in a majority of both the front and back end in terms of the products like info products on the back and then a lot of the front-end uh marketing as well. um a lot of the organic and then now we have brand faces that I will get to talking about but these exist in the ads and VSSLs. So we are diversifying the front end and as well kind of as the middle uh of the company so we can have multiple brand faces for diversification for um you know uh reduce founder risk as well as just match and match with the target demo a little bit better. Media buyers we have metedicated it's actually like one division or one person um but really there's kind of like two within there. So one actually does media buying, one's kind of the higher level guy. Um, and then we have a Google media buyer that's direct. And then we have a content copywriter that is an OG that has been with the company since we had like 15 20 people. Um, and then a senior copywriter that is more focused on uh ideiation and kind of more parts of the paid copy. So more stuff that exists within email uh landing page you know copy like that that exists within um kind of like organic piece of it more so content truly. Uh and then senior copywriter lives in the paid side. So this is the marketing team. Now, within marketing, we ran 71 million through this funnel. Oops. Uh through this funnel right here. This is an opt-in VSSL funnel. So, running majority meta-spend. Um some Google definitely all obviously like retarget brand, all that. Um but then a little bit of cold now is through Google and YouTube, but a majority is through meta. Ran it as an opt-in. Um so, uh name and email coming through here. Watch VSSL. Uh cookie button or whatever you call it, delayed button until the CTA. All the automations and stuff behind this. If I filled this with automations, this page would go forever. Um, but going through the VSSL, pushing them over to an application, fill out an application, go through a router, they either land on a qualified booking page, fire the pixel, uh, book on with the top closers, all that, or they land in the DQ, which is about 50 or 60% are DQ in accordance to what we have for the quality routing right now, and then land here. And these will go with newer closers, uh, or kind of like the the middle tier closers. success page primed thank you page setter will call them to confirm I'll talk about changes we're making around this and then go over to a closer to close them to where their purchase okay so this core funnel right here is what has been responsible for 71 plus million before we even launched other funnels all right so when we decided so like overall focus-wise and like department uh strategy we wanted to diversify we needed to diversify because we pressed this one too hard okay and when this happened last year and it broke it was because we had all of our eggs in one basket and we're focused all on this and didn't have other funnels back uh in the backup or this VVS as our uh CMO calls it the value vortex system. So now we have multiple VSSL opt-in funnels. These different color one up here is what I'm identifying as other brand faces. So we have one brand face with multiple messaging and then we have another brand face and another one in the queue uh with their own stories with their own pieces, their own messaging pockets uh just with them in the ads and them in the VSSL and then it branches over here into the company when it turns into the application booking all that flow. Okay, so we rolled these out. We also rolled out a DTA which is the most classic way that most people run these. So that exists and then low ticket ascension. I'm not going to break all these down. I have tons of videos on the channel where I talk about these. Now, the biggest issue is just that we completely kind of like lost focus. So, we're running all of these and while they're all working, the data around it and understanding what to lean into and just kind of like common sense might be the wrong phrase, but looking into which one of these is truly standing out as getting the best cost per live call because that's essentially what you're controlling here. Like yes, it's cost per sale, but it's also like when you're trying to throttle for availability because that's generally speaking what your kind of like pinch is and your constraint when it comes to the marketing side of things is like obviously the cost, obviously all these pieces, but when you're like ramping into something, you need to know which one of these buckets do you want to lean spend in that can continue to scale up that has the best cost per live call and the best cost per sale. Okay? And we haven't really been focusing for a long time. We've just kind of been focused on cost per call and then cost per purchase and making sure that we can like thread that needle. But between optimization and different funnels, what we're starting to find is the like show rate differences. For example, like we knew it was going to be bad on this, pretty bad on this uh creative testing where we're optimizing for schedule or something earlier in the funnel instead of sale or purchase. Way worse show uh show rate. We have different messaging funnels that like are like so this one for example the messaging in this by the time that they apply it is just not in resonance with what happens on the success page what the messaging is on the back end. If you go watch my interview with Jeremy Haynes he talks about backend sales systems and how a big focus of what's happening over there is priming the person so hard that your closer is essentially just a cashier. Uh and that is just not something we've been doing at a good enough level. Um and that has differed across VSSLs. So we'll have different different ones have different show rates, have different uh expectations, have different framing, different CTAs, all of that. And so we are getting back in alignment with that and really just trying to nail we have this one as the core and we're trying to nail one of these as the main lead funnels and then also this low ticket ascension funnel. Again, I don't really want to talk through this whole thing because I don't want to waste a bunch of time. There's other videos on the channel. Um but this low ticket ascension funnel has the best economics, the best show rates, the best priming for a closer. The issue is that we can't scale into it because this cannot take it through paid in the same way uh on cold traffic. So it can only get up to x amount of scale before generally or like you know basically saying that it uh the net CPA slips once we get to a certain size. So what we are focused on in marketing now into this future and kind of where things I don't want to say broke cuz like it's working but it's not working at the level or at the cost per acquisition like target we want and cost per acquisition is a function of marketing and sales right so like if they both can take responsibility fully then you have like you know 1 plus 1 equals 5. So marketing is what can we do in framing messaging to keep the cost per live call down but the quality so high, the show rate so high um that the math is just insanely good. Um and then also the closer job is so easy and then figure and then solving for that. So really it's what can we nail with one uh one funnel that is a buyer funnel and what other than the core funnel can we nail that is a lead funnel. Okay, so our target is leaning into there sales side of things. So really just consistency and getting once you get the consistency around it like right now their biggest issue is show rates because of these multifunnels like the messaging isn't in alignment. So they're getting we had this we had the lowest show rate we've ever had uh not ever but the lowest show rate we've had in like a year and a half uh last month and there's like seasonality to it and this and that. like I'm not going to allow any of that to be the blame because it's clearly what we're doing here in messaging, what we're doing in optimization, what we're doing uh in framing before versus after that needs cleanup and then what the messaging is that occurs post uh in emails, in texts, uh in conversation with the setter, if they even get to a setter, for a setter to confirm with them. Um so yeah, so that's kind of where we're focused on the marketing point. On the sales point, it's what can we do around this messaging? uh a lot of the we we had some management changes and things that occurred that instantly boost things up, but then we had culture issues and kind of culture fit jive pieces. So I'll make other videos on that probably in the future, but we adjusted how we were uh operating and managing in that department. Um and I'll get into that part here. So for we have a new chief of sales that came in that is an absolute rockstar full ramps in a couple weeks that we are focused on. Uh we have a sales ops manager that's been like with us for a minute now and just crushes has taken on way more responsibility and then actually is leveraging who we're using internal for our tech support. So um this person is a rockstar and really wasn't getting leveraged within the uh tech team can do any SOP can do any automation can do anything like that and uh or manual automation. So like anything you don't want to directly automate. So now she is being leveraged inside the sales role to do essentially like VA uh SOP work inside the CRM inside audits inside all that which frees this person to do much more high leverage you know peopleto people side of things. So this person looks over both setters and closers chief of sales over outbound director which is essentially setter manager and has a grouping of setters and then we have all of our closers. Okay. So, we made the move um from 30 to 45 minute call slots because we had so many missed opportunities within the sales bucket. Essentially, missing 10 to 20 calls a day where one call was going over because it was longer than 30 minutes. They're working out financing, they're working through objections, whatever, which again, objections and all that piece and the framing does come back to marketing and how the messaging is either here or here. Um, so we are focused on fixing that on the marketing side so that it flows over to the sales side, but we moved the call booking range. And it's hilarious because we have the same count of bookings on day because so many of the sales reps were setting blocks on their calendar so that the calls could go from 30 to an hour. And then the ones that weren't were having a lot of missed opportunities where they had to basically say, "Oh, I'm on another call. Can you give me 10 minutes or 15 minutes or try and pass the call off?" A lot of broken things there. So once we get those stats in, we actually had our highest close rate we've had in a very long time. like year to date it's the highest close rate but because the show rate wasn't there the the blended sales per booking which is a function of uh show rate and close rate was lower this month which is not ideal um and then again we also had some management and culture kind of shifts and changes that occurred in this department um but yeah so marketing setters sales they are like all moving in the right direction with a couple tweaks I bet we can unlock 4.5 to five just like that um just from some changes there and then in doing so we likely are going to be spending the same amount so CPA will drop and marginal drop on that. At this range, we are up, you know, over overhead numbers. If you watch past videos where I'm talking, we're at like 1.5 1.6 million. We have a large team as you can see here. Um, and a lot of fulfillment because we are coaching heavy. Uh, very little info. So, we have an entire team of coaches that onetoone fulfill on our offer. So, we are very team heavy and very management of people heavy because you have so many team. Uh, and then all US-based, W2, all the things. So we are found found foundationally set to be doing 5 8 10 uh a month with just some small scales and tweaks and I bet we are going to unlock that here uh over the next 30 to 90 is our target. Um next into fulfillment onto this piece. Um and I can kind of go into these funnels deeper on other videos if you guys want or like as we change them but all to say these are all running and they all actually have like pretty good stats but now we're getting all the data around. So kind of jumping over actually to tech first. The tech department now has a marketing and is soon to be full sales tech. Uh right now it's all marketing tech and the data that unlocks and what we're doing with custom data lakeink uh and uh source of truth and everything that we're moving from HubSpot or having as HubSpot in connection with the data lake is massive like the data that we have the uh cost per live call per funnel based on last attribution across these ranges across this and this uh the completion rate throughout like the throughput versus one versus the other so we can know which one to spend into what campaign and take 2k budget from here and put it into this one that outputs this like all of that is starting to show and come through in good reporting. Uh and that has been a major unlock for us to be able to make these decisions because we didn't have the proper data which is essentially on me because I used to sit as marketing tech even though I was like sitting up here uh and running that. So this department is like crushing right now now that uh he has uh bandwidth free um from the marketing. I mean I always did the marketing tech but the sales tech piece. Um so now this is being more system tech and kind of uh fulfillment tech while still doing some of the sales tech and passing the torch because this happened within the last 30 days. But in that fulfillment side of things. So fulfillment is another big unlock for the actual like cash collected and the LTB to CAC ratio. So over here you're going to have chief of people and product which is kind of like a dual split world where where is it? So this is essentially you have retention team which is fully focused on what happens after that first year of the pro of the program finding them in activation points and resigning them for either another year. We rolled out a lower uh a lower price continuity. So, it's basically like a downell continuity offer on the back end, which will be a major lift um to the retention percentage and it's also has a much higher um uh gross like a margin percentage. Um, it's technically lower dollars, but it is able, because it's a group coaching model, the fulfillment allows you to have 10 times the amount of client load. Not 10 times, but like six times the amount of client load over here where you have one coach to many groups, uh, instead of one coach to one person and across, you know, call it 50, 100, 150 clients, whatever number. Um, I've seen people run the business model different ways. You have a CS team. You have an HR because we haveund and whatever W2 team. You have a talent experience manager that's all about onboarding and then like internal culture leading all the departments in that way or leading all the culture within the departments in that way. And then you have your coaching staff which is a massive team of onetoone coaches. So all of this sits over here and that is a massive fulfillment lever because or I'm sorry a massive monetization lever because we can offer and in increase LTV on this layer right here because these are the onboarding. So what other things can we introduce? What other offerings can we have? So we're building out a new front-end offer. We're building out uh continue um like uh in addition LTV boost that will then happen on onboarding. So there are other things that we're going to offer. I can go into that later. Um, but all of those have kind of been like in progress and sitting there and it's hard for one person to kind of work on all of these all at once. Um, so we are navigating that piece. But fulfillment has been crushing in terms of like actual client results in terms of changing the framing to be like we're servicing your one-year contract to get you the most result possible to that plus, oh, this is a lifelong approach. Oh, this is a multi-year approach. And then these guys are coming in and absolutely crushing it. So our target this month is like four and some change. And I think we can hit it uh with some of that. And then kind of leaning a little bit deeper into this tech piece. Uh we had major wins here. We had major major wins in terms of what we're doing with data and tech and the data side of it that already existed for marketing just got like gasoline poured on it. So now we have eyes on everything over here. Um the tech standpoint of what we're kind of slowing them down on this. We have different platforms we're moving to um for setters and closers for um dialing. Right now we're on Elawware and HubSpot. We have dialers that we're looking at. We have uh send blue or messaging blue uh platforms looking at for closers. So all the levers we can pull to like make their jobs more efficient, we now have the bandwidth to be able to do that in a tech uh system setup. Um because you know we kind of were like backlogged. Fulfillment side uh like I said is already kind of there. And then this finance finance and op side is huge. So structurally right now I'm essentially how we're structuring this is all of these kind of just like full run their own departments and then what'll happen is I'll have a cadence with all of them. We have a cross sync meeting where we'll do like an operationalwide meeting. And really what I'm trying to foster is they all kind of report to the collective of themselves in here. So this team comes in makes decisions all together. I sit in there and then Luke up here and oops whatever names who cares. Um Luke up here. Um we don't we hate titles. So integrator, COO, CEO, visionary, whatever. It doesn't matter. like we sit in on this meeting, we're making group decisions and then the idea being that they come and and implement those within their departments and we put them in the project boards. The project boards get broken down into, they get assigned, they get due dates, they get timelines, all that. And it's kind of becoming a bottleneck where we'll make all these good decisions and like people ask me like oh like where where you know I always ask I'm like oh what's your bottleneck? Where are you stuck? I can very clearly identify what is happening and but to get it to be executed like through departments and then have the department lead uh or seuite be able to execute on them within their department both at the people level and the project level has become like a big kind of spot we're almost like stuck at um and where we're not getting the team efficiencies out of the clearly massive headcount we have. So the next role in this in this finance and ops world is I'm getting tons of data reporting now that I have that either I've built or the team has built for how we can optimize and get team efficiency and see basically like return on team return on person global as well as at the department level all the costs that are associated by users and licenses and seats um all that and then the new piece that I'm about to roll out is I'm going to get a project manager that right before this meeting I just uh hired that is going to essentially sit right here under me. So, no name. We're not using names in here. No doxing. So, we're going to have a project manager that essentially sits under me that I don't even know where you want to put this, but let's just throw it like right here because that's kind of more so where it is. And we'll sit under me and we'll sit in on all these meetings and notetaking is probably the wrong word, but like basically come in. We're going to have all the conversations, make these decisions instead of playing phone tag where I go here, we have this conversation, uh we all have this conversation about what needs happen in marketing. Then this is person is responsible for putting this into project boards, get setting timelines, uh assigning everyone out, knowing what needs to happen before the next person happens before the next and then have to like follow up the people for deadlines and get all that done. Like we have so many key like you know Seal Team Six vibe people, but like it's almost like they're just like everyone's excited in a room but can't figure out the structure and order and what in which it needs to happen. So, this person, no silver bullets, no silver bullets, uh, but is going to come in and be able to support in helping like lead through the structure of all these projects, and then I'll have a cadence with this person going through essentially like whip reports and whip um, setups on where we're at with different projects. I will continue to have the cadence with all of these individual uh, leaders and what projects are going on in their department with this person sitting side by side me. So, I'm very excited for this because I think this is kind of like the unlock of efficiency. and I literally said like no more hires after this until we hit, you know, five million plus a month just because I want the revenue per employee back to XYZ dollars. Um, and that's kind of where we're at. So, yeah, I'm uh I'm stoked on this. I have some new numbers on here. I mean, everything is at some level up and to the right. Um, but it's like still squishy fluffy up and to the right. And this number needs to be four or 5 million for this math to start kind of shoring out to where I want it to in terms of like profit uh in terms of cash flow in ter in terms of reserves that I'm sitting at based on the first essentially four to five months of the year that were terrible. So we're kind of building ourselves out of a hole here and I'm not going to just like pretend like we're Oh my god, it's going to drive me crazy. Was that like that the whole time? Um so yeah, I mean that's that's my focus right now is doing those and leaning into those. So, not sure if this was as helpful as can be, but yeah, this is a setup. This is where we're optimizing for. Um, I'm real excited for kind of who who's new on the team in some of these core positions. Uh, we have like very good synchronicity now across this and we're going to see how that runs. This is going to be a major unlock for me. I didn't do a ton of, you know, I feel like I kind of shared what went right and what went wrong in these, but all of them have more efficiencies. All of them have more output for what is in the team. We have such strong people. We have such strong culture. We have all of that like right there teed up and it's just like we're just missing that quick unlock. You look at marketing and it's like okay cool. It says cost per live call and we just need to figure out which one of these buckets to lean into and optimize around and it's right there. You look at the same thing on the buyer side of it on the buyer funnel. It's like right there. Sales it's like okay cool. It's consistency around these metrics and once they're there it's more reps and then the volume is right there to follow because marketing can fill. It's fulfillment knowing that right now we're a leaky bucket. We're going to change out our client fulfillment software literally coming into this next month. um which is going to be able to get more efficiencies in how many clients per coach we can have. So that'll get cost down as in relative because the baseline will go up. We're going to do the same thing um with what our leaky bucket in terms of what we can continue to sell them both in ascension and retention. So retention piece after the year and ascension piece in what other offerings we have or additional pieces tech so much leverage in what we're going to get from the data systems and structure that we're changing where everything is going to be centralized in one source of truth which is amazing for enterprise value and future everything right because we'll have everything in one place none of this scattered six sheets and whatever and then the finance and ops feeds off of that but then also just structurally how we're doing things with a project management lead that sits there next to me. So hopefully this was helpful. Um, I kind of just yapped there for a second, but I got to fly out of here and I did this one way too late today. So, I appreciate you guys. I don't know what day it is. 110 or 112 orund I don't know something. But you guys rock. Links down here. I'm doing a survey info-coaching. Uh, this is just survey where I'm just trying to figure out what people are doing in the space. Offers, pricing, uh, cash collected numbers. It has, uh, contact info on the end if you want to. You don't have to. Um, and then doc, this is going to show all the videos, uh, and all of the ones we've made every single day for 110 or something days. Broken down by marketing, sales, ops, tech, all that. And then Rolodex. People constantly ask me on what needs to happen or who they need or who I have recommendation for in terms of sales, marketing, tech, who I use for personal coach, what softwares I use. These are ones I've trust. These are ones I vet. I refuse to send the names of these people because I'm not just going to get them blown up in their DMs. So, if you feel like you qualify, have some minimum thresholds that it can make sense, but you need to send me context cuz like the sales vendor for example, like I'm completely under the assumption that people should not or the belief, I'm sorry, that people should not have internal sales teams if they're running an info coaching cash flow business. I think it is something you should just outsource and worry about the other pieces like marketing and how hard you can scale it uh at the right costs and then fulfillment and LLTV and then just let the sales happen uh outside uh for a fixed fee. So, I have this, but like this guy does only works with people, for example, that are over 100K a month, maybe a little bit less, but very rarely. Then have the right structure and offer and all that kind of stuff. So, like I'm not just going to give you the name. So, you just DM me on IG, let me know, give me some context, where your offer is at, what scale you've done, how long you've been around, all that kind of stuff. And if it makes sense, I'll make an intro. Same thing with marketing. I have media buyers, I have agencies that we've worked with that I that we are now in-house, we don't work with, um, guys who build offers for beginners, beginner guys. This guy's a G. um as well as for massive big business like he deals with people do multiples a month multiple million a month um but also doesn't really matter you I'm you know you can find people on X or you can ask or you can do whatever but people were asking so that's that I appreciate you guys hopefully this was helpful for you it was helpful for me to write it out and think it out and hit me on Instagram or X bye This
