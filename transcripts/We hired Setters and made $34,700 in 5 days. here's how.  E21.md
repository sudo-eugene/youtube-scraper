In today's video, I'm going to share how we did $34,700 in the first five days of having setters. I'm going to go through what we call auto sets versus self sets, the difference between them, and the stats behind them, the current buckets of traffic that we are giving setters across the funnel. And then if you stay till the end, you're going to see the future buckets of where we intend on implementing setters as well as optimizations to those current buckets. All right. So, last year we did 30 million in cash collected and I make all the videos on this channel just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing now to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So, first things first, the difference between an auto set and a self set. Okay, so for us, we're calling an auto set. Basically, people who directly book in with a setter through a calendar widget versus them dialing the CRM, finding, you know, dialing 100, getting five to pick up, and then having one set. All right, that's a self set versus an auto set. And I'll go through why that's a little bit more important later. Um, but here's the overall funnel. I have different videos on the channel that go way more in depth into this, but it's relevant for this video to see uh just kind of quick overview. So, as of now, we have two different main funnels. You have the VSSL funnel up here and then you're going to have the low ticket funnel down here. All right, both of these are getting cold traffic direct to them. But just as a quick overview, VSSL uh name and email on the opt-in page, watch the VSSL, then land on an application uh 16 17 questions where we get the phone number for the first time. Depending on their answers, specifically on a financial qualifier, they're going to land either on a higher quality booking page, then be able to book the call, get on a sales call, and talk to a sales rep and close. And if not and they have a lower financial qualifier, they're going to go into this DQ routing that is going to either put them with lower quality closers or ramping closers or push them over here to the low ticket. All right. Now, the low ticket funnel direct has its own traffic to it where it is a two-step order form or a two-step sales page basically. So, the first one you're going to collect name and email. They're going to go to a checkout page where they're going to be able to complete checkout. Then they are going to be asked to book a call. Um that call is a 15-minute Zoom slot and that is with a setter, not a closer. Okay. then land here, ask for some app, and then they get on the phone with a setter. All right, so for the auto set, what I'm referring to specifically is these calls right here. And in current state, it's the only bucket that it exists. Okay, so the only way that someone gets auto booked on with a setter is through load ticket post purchase. So in an attempt to like protect them from having just a ton of people book in with them that are maybe lower quality and not as optimized into the future uh or into the future, we can optimize around that. Um but in current state it would just be this portion. Okay. Now stats behind this bookings 32 no show one cancel six that's a show rate of 78%. Okay four closed with cash collected in total of 20K AOV 5K. All right so that's insane for us. So this is like fantastic and this is not. Um so let me share what I mean. So down here and to clarify this 32 bookings is how many actual sets occurred. Okay, not how many bookings came into the setter calendar. So I have all the stats on this and I can go into deeper when I do another video on like the current low ticket what we started at as we're optimizing. Um but in current state call it double that have come through. So we would have on this 60 calls that came in with a setter and that booked direct onto a setter calendar. Of those 32 were set onto a closer calendar. Okay. the this show rate is crazy is so good for us. Like we average right now 50 55 and that's broken over time and gone gone down to like 45 but right now call it 50. So the fact that the show rate is this high is great. The close rate is also pretty good um for us right now uh with whatever that is 12% or so. Um so we optimize around 10. Our goal for setters and for these is like 20. So that's what I mean by this needs to get better. Um because what happened to the ones in between? Okay. Now, great stats there. And the why I want to show you that is because the difference between an auto set where they're just constantly coming in or autobooking constantly in and the selfset. Self-s set is where we're going to have people that are dialed from the CRM or found in different buckets. Okay. So, of our self-s stats, we have 30 bookings that have come through, which are sets. Seven of them have no showed, eight have canceled, which is a show rate of 50%. Only two have closed, which is with uh two full pays of 7200. So total cash collected is 14,400 and the AOV is 7200 like I said because it's two units of full pay. Now look at the differences between these and this is very limited and early data. I just want to share like as we go. The whole point of this channel is just me sharing like what we're learning and how we're actively doing it. But this is crazy to us um the difference in the show rate right in the beginning. Now where are these coming from? Okay, current buckets is these two are going to be considered self-s set and these are going to be auto. Okay, now self-s set right here. Someone's going to apply and they are going to get routed based on the financial qualifier. Now, some people will land on this booking page and this one actually kind of is like right here and there's a form on there that says, "Hey, can't find a time that works for you? Fill out this form." Those forms zap into a channel and then the uh setters hit them forever the closers have, but now the setters do. So the setters basically get these like layup leads that are right there that are trying to find a time that doesn't fit on the calendar. So they get those which is a setter hot leads channel. And then the biggest one is this app notebook. So you're going to have people that land in this that for us it's about 50%. So on a given day you'll have 200 applications with a 100 book calls. So 50% drop off. So what happens to the pe the hundred that applied but did not book. Uh we have follow-up sequences. I have other videos where I talk more about this that we have like our automated communications through SMS. that's AI, um, email, but now we're having setters call them. Now, as we've scaled, this number has gotten way bigger than 100. So, call it two or three or whatever, hundred that have not that are app no books in a given day. And like, it just wasn't optimized. So, the first couple days of giving these to setters, we just zapped them into a channel and we said just claim them, call them, and go from there. Now, we have like a routing and priority listing. So for us, the financial qualifier is less than 1K, 1 to 5K, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 plus, I believe. Um, so we have them now coming in with different notifiers. So if they're less than 1K, that's like nothing. It just shows that it came in. The next one has one bell, two bell, three bell, up to four. So they can quick scroll through uh what happens overnight, what happens over the weekend, um, or just when they come in real time, and they can see which ones are the higher priority because they can see the more bells. Okay, so just that has this uptick in claimed because now they know which ones to prioritize and call versus having it so it's just all of them in there. Um so that's that bucket right there and then this low ticket direct booking. So this is like crushing for us. Um like absolutely crushing for us right now. Um the biggest thing here is going to be volume more than anything and then optimizing around what happens in these different uh what happens with the calls themselves and outcomes. So, as of now, we're not really tracking this. And like none of this is optimized. I'm literally just sharing just raw stats of what has happened in the first like x amount of days. And obviously, like extremely low uh in terms of volume on this, like six units is really not that much. So, I throw this as like the title just cuz you know, clickbait. Love it. Um but for us is very low volume. Um now, future buckets going into this. That's why I put some of these red ones. Um and then things not included. So, cancels, no shows right now. Actually, let me back up a second. So the current buckets are not optimized. So I have a huge issue with us adding more to the plate in terms of team focus like just overall optimization until it's actually like they're fully optimizing the app notebooks. They're fully optimized on the setter hot leads. They're fully optimized on um taking the call. So like these right now are not at capacity. We can take 60ish a day which for us would be like 100 low ticket. Right now we're selling 40 low ticket. So it's 25 30 of these a day. Um, so once we double volume, we're going to need to grow team on this side, which is good. Um, because the stats on this are solid. Um, once they come in, they land in this call scheduled. So, we don't know how many of them landed no show cancel. Like, we do, but we just don't have trackers on it or enough data is probably a better way to say it, uh, on these yet. But what can we change in this frame to make it so more of these uh, go from call scheduled to closed one set, right? This is the number one optimization. So, it's like if we can get 50, 70, whatever. like I don't even have numbers for you yet on terms of how many of those should set and then go up to a calendar here and then this is the next optimization point. So of that how many of the sets actually turn into closed one versus no showing and cancelling and this kind of like this like perpetual loop because what the next bucket we want to put setters on is having them on no shows and cancels. So, for the marketing direct bookings, how uh do we reclaim those no-shows and cancels assuming 50% no-show and cancel, which is crazy, but true. Like, how do they get how do they recapture those? And what percentage of them can be recaptured? And then from their own sets, how do they make sure that their sets do not know, show, and cancel? How do they nurture them leading up to? Because if we can get show rates on sets to 80% call it um which would be cra like amazing for us 7580 and then those also then close out at the same rate so call it a live uh a 20% live call close rate that would be fantastic. So future bucket I just talked about cancel no-shows um Mandy SMS help this is the app notebook automated AI is our Mandy. So having them in there because it'll flag when people want like to talk to a human basically or like when they say stuff that would be that the AI doesn't know how to handle it flags those channels. So taking over that channel um these guys really want an inbound ring group. So a phone number dedicated that's on marketing assets that's sent out in emails and then taking over comment guard and putting in there right our our market's 40 to 60 years old. So, putting in, "Oh, yeah, just give us a call in a comment." And then having that ring group uh set up for setters would likely be a nice lift of two, five, 10 a day of sets for us, which would be very nice. Um, and then sales hot leads. This one I'm really back and forth on. I need like a full dedicated video to this one, but sales hot leads is the sales version of the setter hot leads, which it so basically it's them passing off. Right now we do a 30-minute sales slots or sales call slots and a lot of the time the calls will go over like almost all of the closed deals are 40ish minutes and we have not done a good job of like optimizing around making sure that all the calls can go the right length that uh no shows and cancels are put in the right buckets and that they're free when they need to be because if they have backtoback it's like you know they have an hour off where they have no shows and cancels. So having some way that if they take a call and they're basically double booked or they need to pass it off because they're they're running late on a call because they're getting a close that they can transfer those to setters. Right now they transfer them to each other as sales hot leads amongst the closers. Um but the dream state is to do it through setters. So that's the next bucket on there. So, all in all, um I'm going to come up with some more videos to share about like what the math is on this because this is cranking right now and we're getting uh of these deals, right? Four of them have come from low ticket within the first like 5 days, which is great. Um and then these two have come from the basically mining the CRM. This number I want to be like crazy high uh in terms of actual close because this is the this is the real like what else are we squeezing out of the VSSL funnel because we know the stats across the board on this thing just as marketing just with closers like down to the T down to a T. Um but how much can we squeeze if we have setters at every layer of this optimized and parts of this of the VSSL funnel? Um it's we're looking at as like two dedicated teams. You have like your self set and then you have your auto set. self set will take over multiple of these and the auto set will just run these. Right? So other ways that we can add to the auto set um is if we wanted we could put on this DQ booking page. Right now it's closers on both these. It's higher quality closers and lower quality closers. What we could do is make it so the DQ page it goes to setters instead of closers. That's an option. We could make it so the automations that happen here, pushing them back uh both in email as well as text can push to a page that's for setter bookings instead. So basically, you would just make it so the main booking page, the marketing funnel, it gets the top quality people only through here and everyone else is forced through a setter before they can book a sales call. So that's an option um and kind of where we're at. But right now, I just want to optimize around them. These are solid stats for the beginning. Um, but like we need to do 10 times this for this to be like super worth it. And again, first 5 days not optimized, not anything. Um, so yeah. So excited to see where it goes. Um, I'm going to make another video here soon on the low ticket stats, where we're at uh so far, the ascension rate, the uh layers between this percentages, and kind of where we're at with that AOV. So let me know if you guys have any comments or questions about these other videos you want me to shoot and then Instagram for communication as always. So, talk soon and have a good
