In today's video, we're going to be talking about making your old self look stupid. Everything on this channel is very data and system driven, but I think I would be doing a disservice to not share a little bit of mindset as it is the overarching thing that covers all of your personal and business life. All right, so by the end of this, you're going to feel good about making your old self feel stupid and you are going to learn how to take your current ceiling and make it your new floor. All right, then we're going to get back into our regular scheduled programming with some data and go through some stats about YouTube and our business. I've been making these videos for 33 days straight and I share buyers cash collected updates on the business at the end of each one of these videos. Last year we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. I share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 mil. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people who are doing the same. And all I ask is subscribe, comment some topic ideas, things you like or don't like, and then like the videos you like. So, let's get into it. So, like I said, making your old self look stupid. This is I have this on sticky note and I just like always say it. I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do it, but I'm a huge believer in beliefs drive your behavior. So like basically how you look at things and what you believe to be true drives how you act and then how you act and show up on a daily basis is what creates your identity and who you are. All right? And that is in personal and business. So some examples of this is our belief around this is the way to run a call funnel drives how we run that funnel which then creates the identity of our of us as well as the business of this is how this is okay so an example of that right here is I have other videos where we deep dive this but like this is the funnel we've been running forever with an opt-in page VSSL page application book a call get on the phone okay like very simply put last week we're talking to people and I've heard this forever and we have tested it and not to say we But there are people doing way bigger numbers than us that are literally running straight to a VSSL page application and then book a call. And why that's important or an example is like we start to deep dive into the data and when we run purchase campaigns versus schedule, you know, we have such a low opt-in rate that all this qualified traffic isn't making it through the opt-in page and we have all these beliefs around it as oh well if they opt in, they have um a higher intent and they get nurtured more and like all these other pieces that just like may not be serving us well to have that belief. So, we're building out this entire thing that is a different funnel structure than we've been running for the last 70 million. And it was just kind like sparked my brain a little bit and I figured I would talk about it here, but we've held that belief so strong that oh, if you get an opt-in then you can nurture more through email, they're more qualified, there all these things and it could just be completely wrong and our entire economics of our business model could change in a day if we run something new. So, it's just like holding on to that old belief in a month from now. We could look back and be like, "Wow, are we stupid because we just, you know, left 100 million on the table or something, right?" Like that's an example. Posting on YouTube every day will drive X is my belief. And then my behavior is I'm posting on YouTube every day and like that becomes part of my identity. That becomes who we are. Not to say it's right or wrong. It's just like a belief, an example. Lifestyle ego. I could go into this in like a huge other video, but the belief around this is how you should show up with the Lambo and the watch and the parties and the stuff because that's either normal or because that's what means success or whatever drives you to do that behavior all the time and then you become that person who postes the Lambo and does this and whatever. And like of course there's time and place for things especially in like marketer world, internet marketing to like post that kind of stuff and use that as a marketing tool. I personally I no longer like prescribe to that belief. Um I have a lot I could talk about this. Um but yeah, mine has just kind of come down to just being raw and believing that sharing the stuff, the good and the bad is then what I do. And then it creates the identity of like I'm the person who shares the good, the good, the bad, the ugly, and it's just like real and it's not some like show and putting that on. Okay. And then people do change. What I mean by this is like you know you hear the people can't change, people can't whatever. And I do believe people will return back to baseline or to the beliefs or systems or things in their life that are the most like strongly held. But to say that people do not change, I I just don't believe that at all. Like if I look back a year ago or 5 years ago, it's like you do change. Everyone's naturally growing. It's just at what rate did they grow and then what are they actually leaving behind versus carrying through. Okay? Because like you have things that you have protected right here. So like goal is to outgrow your old self, not protect it. there are pieces of you and other people that will protect parts of it uh parts of your old identity that you bring through forever. And I think that's more of what people don't change means is like someone is this way, they'll always be this way. Like you can change that, right? So feeling cringe is growth, not embarrassment. And what I mean by that is like YouTube's a simple example. Like I I'm a month into making these. I look back at the original ones and I'm like, "Wow, these are bad." Um and wow, I can't believe I said this or that or whatever. And like I'm just looking at it as growth, not as embarrassment. And for a long time, I did look at as embarrassment. And in a lot of ways in my life, I looked at as embarrassment. I have things that I have done said like just not good that are a year ago or 5 years ago or 10 years ago that I still to this day I'm like, "Wow, that's embarrassing." But it's not. It I can't change it. You can't go back. So it is I just look at it as growth at this point. Um and just try and act now. So I change my belief on it, then act in a different way and become someone different about that, right? in whatever topic. So, YouTube is the current example, but you can literally look at that in any other way. So, like I said, I can't believe I used to believe act like that. I used to talk about doing, now I actually do. I used to chase dopamine like crazy. Now, I have an agreement with myself that is in alignment with that. Now, this is an interesting one because as I was writing this, it's like you can get caught in the race and I literally think I might be in it right now of like, oh, I'm not doing this and I'm have this agreement with myself to act in this accordance. And that can also not serve you over time. Like if you're optimizing for something that you think will get XYZ and it's not getting XYZ or it's ruining other pieces of your life. Like for example, like I'm doing the exact same thing every single day all day for X amount of time now. And like it'll be interesting to see if the lack of moderation in that direction is serving me in other portions of life. And like right now it's where I'm at and right now it's compounding progress in the business life and you know this which you could consider business. But is it serving other places in my life? like I don't know yet and I hope to look back in 3 months or 6 months or a year and be like okay wow yeah yeah that was compounding progress in this way but then I evolved and changed in this way and growth is allowed is a belief I used to always have that's just like it needs to be this huge big thing but it can be subtle and fast or subtle then fast more so you can be just putting in the reps and see it later what looks like quickly it's like the whole overnight success thing it's like all right we've been doing this business for six years I've been doing digital stuff for like 10 years and it you know it's all at once. So growth periods can be exponential, 12 months can be invisible and then all at once. Um, and what I mean by this is basically like for the last 12 months, for example, like or I guess 6 months or so, on paper, the dollars and the cash collected and stuff has been like the worst it's ever been, right? And I am in the belief though that the 10 small shifts we're making is one massive transformation and then what pops out the other end, it is going to be, like I said, new ceiling is going to be the new floor. Um, you can put a lot of work in and not see it all come out until what feels like all at once. And I'm a huge believer in that and having you know two years from now and looking at you know Hormosi has a lot of good videos about this but truly being able to like expand the time horizon on things from two year to two years from two months and we talk a lot in like this space about like oh my monthly numbers and good reasons for that because people don't have years of data and all that but like that's the example is you don't have years of this under your belt and once you do it's easier to think in that way. Okay. So, I guess it's kind of hard to do from the beginning and be like, "Oh, I'll do this for the next 5 years." Like, you don't know. But making your old ceiling the new floor is a really an operating model of new information drives new beliefs. Those new beliefs create how you behave and those behavior creates your identity. And that currently leads to your current ceiling of 100k a month or whatever number. But changing that around and understanding the business model could easily be scaled 5x could easily do this if with new inputs you'd get new outputs and like actually systemized thinking of it. And then that's what changes your behaviors. That's what changes the result and it just loops. It's very easy to then shift to be like 100k a month versus 250 a month versus a million a month. Like those are all very capable and possible. And I talk about this in other videos like the guruy video, but knowing that people can do it and there's a system and framework likely that you're operating in that the ceiling is probably one, two, five million. Like I I always talk about in these videos the there's two people that I specifically know of that run the business model that do over 10 million a month. So it's like I don't need to reinvent the wheel. I just need different beliefs that then drive the like my belief has shifted but like oh this business model can do this. Then we act in accordance with that and change things to where it would fit that model and where they could scale to that and then that creates the identity or the business as is and person as is that runs the business. Okay. So lean into it. So how you can do this surround yourself with people who normalize it big thing. It's also a reason I'm doing this um YouTube stuff a lot is because I don't have people really directly in my life that like in person necessarily that uh normalize this. I do have people I work with obviously and people that I've like been connected with throughout the years, but I want more of those. That's like a big goal of what I'm doing here. So, surrounding yourself with people who normalize this level of growth um and interest levels, right? Like people who talk about the same things, people who are interested in the same things, who are growing at similar rates or trying to um revisiting things you knew that were true and pulseing them, I think, is a big one as well. Um like I said, the callunnel example, but like what else do you believe to be true or did you believe to be true or do you still I guess that you can just pulse check. So going through a list of like what are my currently held beliefs in everything you know in your personal life in your business life that may no longer be serving you or could be questioned now like there's a lot of things like a tactical example is you know how you operate XYZ system and could it be you know redone with AI or um this is how we structure and pay out this but like you hear because you're at some conference that someone pays their team this way because they get bonuses and this and it's like you thought it was to be true that you had to pay someone 200 grand in this operating position but you hear from someone else that they have been doing this for five years in a better way with better results and they pay their team their person 50k. Like there are different ways to view this. Um but yeah, I think revisiting things that you thought you knew were true and pulseing those is a very like tactical way to do this is listing them out and then questioning them. I heard a really good thing on my first million. I love that podcast. But um the other day I was talking about how they do this in a corporate setting or like a not corporate but like a leadership setting where everyone goes and sits in a meeting and just says let's just question everything and like this is open forum. You can't deny anyone's ideas but like how would you do this if you could do this anyway and they talk about like the business model. They talk about their offerings. They talk about like structure of things. Um and I think that would be like a a very helpful thing to do just self audit and then tracking behavioral changes not just results. I've done this for years, but basically back to this having a new belief, identifying what those behaviors are that would then drive that um or would reaffirm that and track those behaviors out. So, you're going to do this, this, this, this. You know, you're going to I don't think you need to go crazy like 4 a.m. morning routine or anything, but like, you know, I wake up at 5, I deep dive into goals or I do a goal review. I deep dive into uh deep work for the next four hours around this specific thing. And then we do meeting like whatever it is about the actual behaviors you do or the things like checkboxes that you do and then just track those and just like make those there because once you have that belief and you drive it in with behaviors and then once those behaviors exist you'll see the output or not output and then you can iterate. It's like a general system. So not just results if I used examples of the last six months of like how I am and who I'm becoming versus the actual dollars that were collected on the back end it would tell a different story. Right? So last six months cash has not been good in terms of the business in this and way and then like I share all that in other videos but to say that the it's because of the behavior the identity that is becoming I would in current state disagree and I can make a video later maybe about like how I believe that into the future. Um but it's just not the case. So the results are not there yet but it is like the planting crop like portion versus the harvesting and I'm a huge believer in that. So let's get into this. Hopefully that was helpful. Um feel free to drop some comments about this. Um I have a lot of the main like gurus and all those videos um stuff like that that I have gone through all start with this and have a huge portion of this. I'm not a huge like believe not believer I'm not a huge I don't know I don't make it like a big portion of my existence to focus on that kind of stuff. Um I just think that there's kind of like the 8020 on what you can focus on and get the result with. So hopefully this was a bit helpful. But all right YouTube 30-day results. So, I am 32 or 33 days into this, posting a video every day, 330 subs, small, but again, the goal of what I'm going for is like high quality people, not mass market, not zero to 10K guys, not any of that. It's like obviously what I talk about is very tactical and like um probably not that helpful to somebody who is under 100K or 500k or whatever a month. Um, so yeah. So this is like as to be expected and like content with that because that's pretty crazy to me even though that there's 330 people that are likely similar and learning stuff. Um 150 on IG. I think this is the best like method I'm using as tracking. So got 150 new followers on Instagram and like 80 to 100 messages. So these are the real goal. It's like yes subscribers because then it's easier to track on platform but like this is what the real goal is is to network connect and then I already have people who could like be talent. So just yeah could go deeper into that but like talent opportunities and network that's the goal is I want people to message I want people to follow I want to talk to people in that range um so that down the road into the future this can be more valuable in terms of like team and people so here's some stats 338 hours of watch time I think that's low but crazy if you actually think about it that people watch my stupid face sit here and talk about this for 340 hours wild um and then yeah someone else is going to know these better than me. But yeah, some of the top videos are like this guru one. I try to make these all as good as possible or like as real as possible. Not as good as possible, as real as possible. Um, but I have some kid that's in here doing like, you know, spammy or not spammy, cringey titles and thumbnails and stuff. So, I don't know how I feel about it. But this specifically was a little bit more mass market, like 0 to 10k. And I think that's why it's already doing so well. Um, but yeah, I just trying to interweave the realness and like the actual stats behind all these kind of things that we're doing. So, a lot of these bigger ones are doing like a lot better um than I thought. So, kind of like the full funnel breakdowns, the we did x amount and like these total offering things. So, I think that'll be interesting to lean into into the future. Um, but yeah, someone could tell me what's wrong or right about these, but that's that and yesterday's stats and then we will shut up. High ticket buyers four. It was a Sunday. Not good. We had low availability. 54 low ticket buyers 28GS. Not good. Again, we are in the trenches right now and we are rebuilding. So, uh I might stop doing these. Let me know if these are valuable for you. Like maybe I'll just do like a general business update on these. Um I don't know. I mean, I'm not I don't care about sharing the number, but I just don't know how valuable it is or if it's offering anything to you guys. So, yeah. As always, like I said, subscribe so you can get some notifications about these. Comment what topic ideas or what is valuable or not to you so I can tailor the content to that. My goal is to help people who are already doing probably 100, couple hundredk a month and scale them up. Um, and then yeah, like the videos you like and don't like the ones you don't. All right. So, talk
