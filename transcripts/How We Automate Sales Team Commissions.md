# How We Automate Sales Team Commissions

alrighty so i get this question a lot when it comes to how to run basically a remote sales team commission um and keep it clean without having to do any like manual spreadsheet tracking or anything like that and more importantly to track the life cycle of the customer especially when it comes to refunds and everything like that so we use clickfunnels actually for our order forms so you can see here we have a bunch of different sales people and you can see that we just set basically a funnel step to each salesperson so this is my order form for example so you can find it with my ryan's link we set the page level just as the same as a two one whatever it is so let's say we're to go to luke's you would see luke has his own order form on his own funnel stuff with his own name um so you do have to duplicate the products you have to create them on each layer separately but for this example let's say we're just using mine so what we do to track it um so this person so for this example so when i sell over the phone or i send out my order form to a prospective client when they pay i need to get commissioned for that and i need to get tracked for that so we actually go into zap do everything through zap all of our stuff happens within stripe so i'll set up a zap and it'll be when a new successful purchase comes through that funnel with that funnel step so my funnel step it'll grab the data it'll then go into our slack channel go into our purchases slack channel and send send a channel message that is you know we do woohoo new purchase we put my name hard coded hard typed into here and then we have this as the fields that come from there so we can say who was the purchase so we have these set up for each sales person its own full zap flow for each person so it sends that message and then this is the cool part so then we actually go into the stripe account you just link up your stripe account we do find a customer we find the customer buy that contact email that came the click funnels you'll see right here so we basically just go into here and we just click contact email so now you're going to filter by you're going to find a customer in stripe you're going to go down here and you're actually going to update the customer then and because you actually in this have to search it by the customer's id so where you find that is actually once you find the customer it spits out what the customer id is and that's going to be that cus underscore so you find the customer then there and then you leave their name leave their email and we update the description to include my number um so i'm agent id or a salesperson id number four you technically put my name in here you could whatever you guys want so like let's say i just want to do it like this but we actually just do numbers just so it's easy to track and so it's easy to use and manipulate in excel so i update it with the description of me as four and that's it so i'll turn that on so basically just in recap we create an order form at its own funnel step with my name specific to me so i'm the only person who's ever going to check out on that form because i'm going to get credit so when a new purchase occurs it's successful on that funnel step it's going to message into our slack channel into our purchases and say awesome ryan got a sale so we can kind of keep the hype up amongst the sales people that who's getting sales find that customer by their email address that came through here and then once you find that customer it spits out the customer id which is that cus underscore number and then you're going to go under here and you're going to update their description with my number so why this is so valuable and important is because let's say i sell 10 000 worth of stuff today or this week within our seven day pay period and three days from now somebody refunds a thousand dollars worth you don't want to you want to be able to know that that refund was my sale so now you're gonna have ten thousand dollars in revenue you're gonna have a thousand dollars in refunds so my net at the end of the week is only going to be nine thousand and the beauty of this is it carries over forever so that customer is now updated to my number so let's say they do it in three weeks or five weeks and in five weeks i have 20 000 a week but a refund happened from x amount of weeks ago it'll still deduct it so you're always just paying your sales people on the net revenue of their cash collected so this way it keeps them accountable keeps you accountable to know kind of all your numbers and make sure that you're not getting you know back tailed or anything like that so yeah there's just a general flow we use so click funnels order form write in send slack find the customer update and then yeah you just go into stripe click on that little export button in the top right on the payments tab and then run it for a pay period drop that into a pivot table and you're good to go so it's a super easy way to automatically track your sales people cash collected minus refunds
