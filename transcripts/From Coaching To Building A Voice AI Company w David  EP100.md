# From Coaching To Building A Voice AI Company w/ David | EP100
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSMsGPMRcoM

What's up, guys? In today's video, we are a hundred days in and we've got David. He's a boss on X and we've actually never directly talked or met. So, this is going to be a good one of us getting to know each other, talking what's working now. So, David, kick it off. Who are you? What's up, guys? My name is David and I've been around for a while. Been around for probably half a decade now. Um, I started out in sales, transitioned into running an agency, and then got, uh, rich doing info, similar to Ryan here. Um, and now I'm retired from info, and uh, I have a little secret project I'm working on in the AI space, and I'm going to be talking about that, uh, probably in the next couple weeks or months. Um, but now I'm a full-blown AI technology entrepreneur running a full company here. Um little bit different than info but um what other accolades did I have? I don't know. I don't know. I did okay. I did. Yeah, you did. Yeah. Yeah. By by what I found online and who I kind of talked to briefly about this before. Yeah, you definitely did. Okay. So So what was the agency piece in the beginning? Um I did. So, originally, like it a weird story and I've told it a few times on other podcasts, like I was in like when I was in sales, I was working at PayPal and uh I was in the fashion industry a little bit like I was doing modeling and stuff like kind of on the side like as a way to like meet girls when I was like what 22 23 um after I got out of a relationship and it was like cool. So, and all the people that I walked for and like did work for were ended up becoming my first clients. Um so it's mainly like higherend luxury stuff and then I realized that like okay the same way that you sell anything um can be sold low ticket high ticket doesn't really matter sales process is effectively the same and then we pivoted into uh doing luxury furniture email marketing for a little bit and then I started on Twitter year what 2021 um in the summer of 2021 I started posting about sales because I had $39.7 million in deal volume when I was a sales rep um outbound over the phone myself. Outbound. Nice. Yeah. Average deal size is about 40k. Merchant lending. Yeah. So, you really had to push to sell. And I saw all these idiots on Twitter talking about, oh, here's how you sell these deals. And I'm like, well, these guys are all wrong. I have some experience in this industry. I have some experience in this space. Um, and I just started, you know, speaking my truth and telling stories about my life, about uh my first successful business, which was throwing parties in college and and doing all stuff like that. And I kind of um made a name for myself. Um 2,000 followers. Uh we we dropped the uh the first info product which was a course community um called cash flow syndicate and uh I believe we did we had over 8,000 customers in the first 13 14 months um of that business. So yeah, low ticket recurring. Um I made a lot of mistakes in that business. Low ticket recurring. Wow. Yeah. A lot of customers for low ticket. Yeah, it was it was a fairly profitable business. Um it would have been more profitable if uh we actually knew what the [ __ ] we were doing back then. And uh it was low ticket recurring um on a card landing page with no upsells, no funnels, and uh like no high ticket ascension whatsoever. And when I ran the unit economics, I was like, "Oh, well that was about 15 million that I left on the [ __ ] table." Oh yeah, dude. I say that today with our thing. I mean, our thing, and we can get into that a little bit, but like our OG was uh our very very first thing was an MR was a 7-day free trial to a $27 month. We had one Otto that was lifetime access like 150 and it was a fitness app but we had zero ascension. We had nothing. It's like we didn't cuz he didn't even understand that worked. Then even now we sell annual recurring coaching but we had no backend offer beyond that or like low like continuity downell nothing. It's just more of the same. And like we did the math and same thing. It's like 30 40 like we left on the table and you look back and it's like you're disgusted. disgusted like just you're just like h and the thing is is running that business is like that was my I never really called myself a marketer and I think you know I know your show is what's working now but let's talk about what doesn't work what's working now what doesn't work and what we're trying now yeah yeah like and and you've probably had a lot more than 10,000 c I've had about in info I've had about 10 11,000 customers total in the past three and a half years because I quit info in February um to go all in on this AI company and I can tell more about that. Um, so what didn't work was uh not studying the game when the basically you got to strike while the iron's hot, right? And so I didn't necessar I don't think I really taught myself marketing until um after I evolved from that business because there's so much I learned about human psychology and marketing and and just how the entire game works as a whole. um specifically when it's centered around offer creation and and copy particularly after that business because when you have an MR business like that with shitloads of traffic, you're just it's just a license to print money in the same way that James Bond is like has a license to kill, right? So you're sitting there and I'm like 20 I don't know how old you are, but I was 24 years old, dude. Like I quit my job like eight, nine months before, like a year before and then like a year later I'm driving to Aston Martin in LA and I'm like just I'm I'm living this amazing life and uh the money was coming in so fast that it was like okay well like let's just keep getting more customers. Um I didn't give a [ __ ] about retention. Uh there was a weekly model. Um it was a weekly, monthly, yearly model. Um, knowing what I know now, I would have uh done a lot of more segmentation um like segmentation when it comes to like unlocks and things like that when you joined the program. Um, I would have hired This was all with no staff, by the way. Um, so was it paid? Uh, what do you mean? No, no, paid or organic. Organic. Oh my gosh. Organic. All organic. I've actually I can't lie and say I've never ran a paid ad for info in my life. I think for that business, we spent $15 on ads and then Facebook blocked us. And then I tried like um I remember when uh Allen's thing took off with uh like the automated model. I Yeah, I did a uh I did a little funnel like that and I my entire test with that was I wanted to see if chat GPT last year um could write a or just straight up write a VSSL that converts on cold traffic. Um so I had uh I did an ad. I didn't really spend that much money, but like we were getting like 2 3x on the front end, but then I turned it off because it was just like 27. I was like making like 27 bucks. I'm like, "Okay, well, this doesn't really change anything at all." And I was kind of trying to decide if I wanted to like continue expanding like that offer, but um I've been pretty bored with info for the past few years. Um so yeah, that's a lot of stuff that doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Trust me, there is the the look back the hindsight 2020 is painful sometimes like when we Yeah. Well, like so we for us right now we have the core offering. Everything goes through a sales call. Everything goes through uh it's a $7,200 annual offer and we just now rolled out some backend stuff, but like even processes around like getting them on the phone or having the scripting or whatever to get to retain them like has been lacking or non-existent. The we're exactly what you said like hamster wheel of it was coming in. We went from we were doing 10 million a year and we're like let's go let's scale to 30 changed the offer stack and we're just hitting it and we're like just go go go without doing the pairing metric of you know profit margin like idiots and not paying attention as well as we maybe should have and we're all paid so we're 99% paid. Is it all subscriptions? Technically yes. Okay. Like there are I mean like subscriptions on the book no because sometimes when you use external financing it's like the loan or the onetime pay. So no in that way but like yes everyone is agreeing to an annual contract that is then you know positioned to do that and that's the other thing even our fulfillment was in a in a way that like our coaches are amazing and like they're doing so good at fulfilling on the annual contract the client wins channel just fires off but like they were good at fulfilling the annual contract not as much the setting the foundation for this is your first year of your five years of journey or your lifetime of becoming like what you are right because ours is all in women's fitness so it's like we we can do one-on-one personalization. We can get you to where you want to get to, but then from there it phases into XYZ and like how do you want to transition or like different things happen hormonally for like our age demo um excuse me, different uh body goals, different things that'll change that like how you would approach it would change. So now we have this continuity backend program. It's like a downell. Um so they'll go from onetoone coaching, they can either continue on with one-on-one coaching or they can downell into something that's half the cost. It's group coaching model. So fulfillment for us is like, you know, way better because they can do one coach to whatever percentage um versus and then they still get all the same stuff. So they get all the access to the community, the coaches, the stuff, but it's through group instead of one to one. So it's like very scalable. Um so yeah, that and then same thing with like supplements and partnerships there, HRT, like these things that our customers already do, we haven't touched and it's like however many, you know, single digits or double digit millions on that that we've just left on the table. So yeah. Yeah, dude. It's I don't know. info for me, info coaching, it I agree with you, right? It's like there's a whole bucket of it where it's like I just I don't even like it. Like it's kind of like this gray area world of things and like it is it can be very boring. It can be very like hamster wheelie if it's just more of the same, more of the same, more of the same. But if you kind of just like dumb it down to where it's like if you can machine it and be okay with it. And then also I like to look at it as like hit exit velocity. So like where can we get where we're like info coaching plus? So like info coaching plus like the the Becker example of similarish to your model kind of right was like info coaching but the Trojan horsing into software and then going that game like a lot of people try that. Most people fail at that. Most most like all fail at that almost except for you know the Becker and the Ovens kind of right like that whole game. Um but there are people who have done it outside of software that have done a really really good job of it. Like I always use a life insurance example guy on here. They use like an info coaching system for that and then on the back end they had they were selling whole life insurance so they were making massive commissions on that which is like a multi-year situation. They were using then the money from that was in whole life insurance to do real estate investing. So like there's a bigger play bigger backend. So like info coaching was the the the front-end model but there's so much more to it versus just all it is is info coaching. And that's how I kind of like stay interested in it is the bigger vision of it. But yeah I love that. Um there was two points that I wanted to touch on. I think the more important one there is that you're right most people never do it correctly. Um I remember when so it was interesting because last year now my company now synthesis um is an AI voice company right um best product on the market we're in four different countries currently um we started really heavily investing into this as a solution um by essentially solving for the second order consequences that happen when you run top offunnel advertising. So obviously what I mean by that is like the majority of people who run agencies are like in the agency space because I had literally a course called the agency course which later became skill stacks after um I dissolved cash flow syndicate. So it's like rebranded a few times. Um but most people are like oh well I lost my I was working with this client for 3 months and then usually it's a problem on the client side right and you have to have uh clear boundaries and a clear scope of work when you go to do business with clients. So we we were starting to mess around with this like selling conversational AI solution and then I had like this highle white label that I was selling um as the implementation, right? So teach and then upsell the monthly implementation um through an automated funnel. And so it was like the the funnel was basically like you come in from one of the lead magnets, you get pushed to a $300 upsell, 197 downell um and then if you take if you take then there's a 97 a month um upsell on on synthesis the software essentially which you what it used to be. Um, and then I had the software business. We had the info business that was like kind of with the software business. And then we had the marketing agency that like we were still doing, you know, fulfillment and consulting for. Um, and I don't claim to have been the best, you know, guy running a marketing agency, but I can say that I'm the best at teaching how to run a marketing agency because I've literally made people multi-millionaires, which is cool. Um, so then we saw that this like voice AI was going to be a lane and um, I literally just said, "Fuck this essentially and and shut down the info business as a whole." And the way that I calculated it out, right, I couldn't machine myself to do it in terms of like investing in paid um, not only investing in paid, but also learning paid because my background was just how do we just get as many customers in the door with with organic content. Um, and then also just being a content machine. And I kind of always hated being on camera even though I'm I've been told that I'm good at it. Um, so what I ended up doing was I shut the info business down and I figured out how to kind of bring everything together. So how do we use the the skill sets from info marketing in particular um and creating offers not only on the B2B side but the B2B B TOC side um and then how do we really create a solution that we can essentially service people who still want to make money in uh online business which is what I've been doing for the past four years. Um and then also service higher level enterprise clients you know hundred,000 quart million dollar half a million dollar deals um you know annual contracts and things like that. So, the whole point that I'm getting at is I figured out that I wanted to do something that I could use all of the skill sets, the corporate sales experience, the stuff that I've learned doing info, the things that I've learned doing marketing, um, and still and continue being, I guess, the face of a company except kind of moving back into the shadows, um, where I wanted to stay to begin with. And the way that I came to that decision, funnily enough, was I just did the math on it. I said, "Okay, like um I can't machine myself to do this. Best case scenario, I'll do 5 million a year topline revenue if I do info if I if I really push info hard because I just can't do I just can't be a machine like that." Like that's just me and me being personal account personally accountable. But is the let's say let's say I take home 200k a month or two two million a year on that. Is that six million in the next three years more or less than I could potentially make if I build a massive company that has corporate corporate contracts, infinite scalability, um international scalability and enterprise value on every single deal that we close. And I just mapped it out and I said, "Okay, well, it's going to be more than that. And if I show up every day, I'm basically guaranteed 20 10 to$20 million." Yeah. Right. Um but it's been an interesting journey. I think that might make for you, right? No, no. Tell it completely makes sense. I mean like we we went from on accident. We went from info coaching margin game whatever while we were selling info and doing 10 million a year with like you know what you consider good when you do paid so call it 30 40% margin to going into this coaching game which is very different and on accident like with all the cost and the team and the machine and the structure that was needed and we suffered immensely from it like the profit margin took a dive like percent as a percentage we technically made more dollars but we tripled and barely made more dollars let's just say right like not cool and and year one of trying this. So, we had to like learn it ourselves in that way. Um, but it completely makes sense cuz now we're trying to do that. But in the short term, we we say it every day. We're like, we're sacrificing for cash. We're sacrificing cash now to try and get info coaching to hit exit velocity to where it could have enterprise value, which is like 0.01% of info coaching, if they ever even try, could do that. And like us, you know, I'm even saying that as a pipe dream, like we're trying to do something that doesn't happen. You don't sell info coaching. Like you don't do that. So versus right what you're saying enterprise clients uh international contracts AI tech plays like those very proven track record for having enterprise value very proven track record for you know and even being profitable now like you hear more and more every day that like non- venture the bootstrapped ones the ones that are profitable off the like not necessarily off the gap but you know what I mean like get to a point of profitability where you can have your cake and eat it too be profitable and have a large exit. So the math makes sense to me. Um, our thing is just like we're so it's almost like there's a bit of like a sunk cost theory kind of thing where we're like we're already in it like it only will take XYZ push and then we'll be at these like profit, you know, it's just always this like only when and if and then we like add this big key player and we're like all right, we're going to take the cash bite because like in the future and like keep like pushing the ball down the road and we'll see how it plays. You know, it's it's a gamble. Uh but it's a gamble on us for execution. So I feel good about it. It's like it's an educated hedge, but yeah, I I love the play of what you're doing. So like what So what is it? So what is voice AI? And for some context, we've tried um what's the Y Combinator backed one? Um bland. We tried bland at one point um because they had for us it's like again we're very uneducated on it. Like I'm the one who has built all the tech and automations and structure and now I have a team that does it but like I built it all up to us doing you know at least through 50 million in cash and beyond. Um, but it's all automations. It's a little bit of AI. Like we have an AI bot in there that does messaging that gets context from the application and has conversations. But the only time we tried to do voice was for uh call confirmations. So we'll get 100 bookings a day, 300 bookings a day, whatever number, and it would call them immediately after they booked to, hey, just so you know, this is a Zoom call. You know, this is the time zone. Do a little brief and do that. And it just couldn't handle it. It people like it just couldn't handle it. So we cut it. We brought real live setters in there. give them like a small percentage if of the cash when it's confirmed and it close. But we went back to people. So like what is the voice AI solution? Yeah, that works. Now it's very interesting that you say that because that is also the sentiment that I had, right? And also the sentiment that a lot of our now customers and clients have. Um this is actually Ryan, this is the first time I've actually talked about this publicly uh ever since I retired from from info. Um, but the the issue with a lot of these voice um there's there's a few competitors. There's Bland, there's uh um Observe, who I think raised $220 million in their series B. There's um there's a few competitors, right? Um as far as our product goes, and I'm I'm more than happy to let you try it after the after this this interview. Um but there's a few competitors and the tech for where it was before and when you probably tried it, I don't know how long ago it was, it wasn't there. Um, a lot of people are using old tech. Um, their models are not there. The system is not up to par. So, you're gonna like our model, right? So, do you did you have to build out Bland yourself? Uh, kind of. I mean, those those like I I will say those kids kids, and I say kids on purpose, like were Red Bull, 19-hour a day, like one kids on one time zone, another one would take over. Literally, I think one of the kids we were working with was like 18, like at his parents house, like they were grinding. And I like respected that aspect of it. So they were trying, but we ended up building a lot of the workflows kind of ourselves in there with them helping us try and route things because their whole thing is built on like the nodes, right? So it's like this happens then it goes into these buckets and like if it doesn't know it goes into this bucket and then kind of reiterates. It's very like flowy. Yeah. Yeah. Um we do it for our clients. So it's essentially like how do we com how did we combine an agency service with a software business plus info marketing, right? Um, now the info side is is a whole another story. It's it's like the principles of info marketing. Um, but we do a full buildout for our clients, right? So, um, there's one of our clients who, uh, is in Australia, right? Real estate company, done over a billion dollars in transactions. They have 70,000 leads that they need to reactivate to because they're opening up a brokerage in Dubai. I live in LA and I live half the year in Dubai. Um, so they're basically rolling this out and then our software can essentially batch call those 70,000 people, reactivate them, set meetings so that they can sell those properties, right? Um, we're going to be working on what's called synthesis commerce soon, which is essentially phone as a channel for marketing in the same way that email is a channel for marketing. So think post-purchase upsells. Um, we have info product clients who are using it for onboarding, um, for customer service, for failed payments. Um, so anything we can really link into with web hooks or any kind of automations, we can all link it into synthesis and um, what ends up happening is is we can build really a custom proprietary system without conditional logic just based on exactly what you need in the business. Right? So that's number one. So there's a hotel deal that we're working on still in Sweden that's like $100,000 hotel deal um, which is like an annual license plus like an integration fee which is like a full buildout, like a full org buildout, things like that. So, um, it is essentially any business with a phone can use it to do anything that you would ever need in terms of sales, uh, customer service or support, right? Whether it's a 24/7 receptionist that needs to speak Russian and Arabic and Swedish at the same time or, uh, it's a salesperson, we can essentially automate 40 to 60% of the work that is done on the phone for companies and for businesses um, across the board in general. um you're still going to need people, but if you take like a contact center or a customer support center, call center, 50 people, you can get it down to like five with one manager. And so the way that I like to explain it is imagine if you didn't have to call the bank and press five, right? Um so the whole idea of it is like how do we create a solution? And it is rather dystopian, right? I was making a dinner reservation in Dubai and I got a call from like um someone who sounded like they were from the Philippines who's probably living in Dubai, working in a call center or even in the Philippines and like barely speaks English and is like telling me the dress code at the restaurant that I've been to 10 times for some reason. And I'm like, well, I can just replace this person's whole job. And what we've done is um if you go and try to use voice is they it sounds like a [ __ ] robot for most of the competitors for most of the if and I'll let you call it after this call dude you can't really tell but obviously you know but like if you're an older person you're in your 40s or 50s 60s you're not going to be able to tell whatsoever. I had my mom call it right the other day when I was home and I had my mom call it my mom was like what the is this a real person? you say, "David, is this a real person?" And um you know, there's there's some people in the space that says they've said that this is the best thing that we've heard and all of our clients currently say that this is the best thing that we've we've heard so far. I love it, dude. No, I definitely I definitely want to try it after this. Like we Well, yeah. And then I also know a lot of people um that are in this Dude, I had this conversation a lot. Uh, I was at um the most recent event I was at, we were outside and someone was trying to sell me on it and was trying to call their version of it. Someone else on on a live call was trying to call theirs of it. Like lead genen guys for live transfers and like the live transfer one's interesting because it's like yes, no, yes, no, and then route them or don't, right? And it's like very simple for those and they do a lot of volume, right? But it's like that's theirs and it makes a little more sense there. But anything that's contextual has been an issue. And same thing with like the timing for the API calls. Like an API call is fine, but then the timing of the API call to come back then do the infer whatever you want to call it on the AI portion and then convert it over into voice. The delay, the latency, the whatever you call it has been an issue in the past. And then same way with communication, communicating to do actions with API that we've tried on some of these platforms has been a big issue. like you have a Calendarly API that's like terrible for example and it's like trying to like go back and like reschedule them dynamically or like find open times on the calendar like it just gets so webbby and like messy and then the latency portion and then one little thing breaks and it's like let's reloop them to the top for like fail like fall back and it's like it's just not so I'm excited. I definitely want to see it. Yeah, it's interesting because that's one of the things that we saw with uh with the live transfer thing. We have what's called contextual live transfers. Not it's not a logic flow, right? So it's if customer says X Y or Z on the phone, it's a prompt. If you say if this guy says this, transfer this to this number like a hot lead. So it's completely contextual, right? Because business is contextual at the end of the day, especially with what is going to need to happen as this rolls out. But the thing is, I'll tell you, it's not perfect. Um but my bet that I'm making is um this is the worst it's ever going to get. And it's pretty true. I mean, yeah, that that's a pretty certain bet. Yeah. And, uh, what's funny is is a lot of our competitors have had to raise capital in order to finance the project, right? In order to build build whatever, right? There's companies that all Y combinator backed. And our product shits on those. And the the be the thing that I love is that I had enough money to do it myself. Yeah. I love that. And um and so I don't have any VCs telling me what to do. I don't have any investors telling me what to do. I am the sole investor, which is great. Um, but from a business perspective, it's like I think that at the end of the day, like I think that we are on a mission to not only change the world, is it rather dystopian, like I said, replacing people's jobs, things like that. Sure. Um, but somebody's going to do it. And you know what? [ __ ] it. I'm an entrepreneur. If you see an opportunity, like you probably never thought you were going to get into women's fitness, but here you are and you're making millions of dollars here. That's the end of and that's it. At the end of the day, somebody's got to drive a Lamborghini or drive a Bugatti or whatever. and somebody's got to make millions of dollars in this industry. Um, so I and I think when you're the right person with the right connections, with the right amount of capital, the right skills, um, and you know, marketing, you're going to be very good and you're going to be you're be able to figure it out. So that's my bet. Um, I hope it pays off. We'll see. I think it's paying off now because we were profitable within the first week of the company. Um, and uh, we're going to be hopefully scaling pretty soon. I don't know what our valuation would be. I mean, private companies, AI technology companies, you can put a whatever valuation on it. Yeah. Should throw a 40x and just call it good. Yeah, just throw 40x. Yeah, just call it good. Yeah. No, that dude that's amazing though. That's amaz like I everyone everyone dreams in info coaching to do what you're doing, right? Like that is and and I said that a bit earlier like everyone has this pipe dream that they're going to go and either one they're going to exit or two they're going to use it as a launchpad to then go do software. A lot of people end up building software then for the ICP of who is inside their info coaching and then it almost exists like in itself and it like solves a little it's a tool, right? It's like a little widget that fixes XYZ thing. There's a guy that I I really respect uh Brooke he lives out in Dubai. I don't know if you met him but he has of course I know Brooke. What? Of course I know Brooke. Yeah, dude. Brook's a G and Brooks is uh like he has that software on the back and he was like yeah you know it does six figures and it's just like a marketplace, right? Like he just has the vendors in there. It connects them. does this and it's like when you use it like that it's super cool right to just like have another monetization method that cost him XYZ to create and fulfill on and it's just like another additive thing for LTV but a true standalone software that like you hit exit velocity I keep saying but like you get out of info coaching and go fullbore that I think off the rip in my head like you know the Becker is really is the the main one of like fully kind of got out of his to get like didn't really Trojan horse a lot but like is in the same industry so I guess it kind of did like play one into the other Um, so yeah, tracking solutions and then hosting for, you know, your course community conversation. But the WAP guys are super interesting. They didn't come from that land, right? They came from the sneaker bots and the trading and that kind of thing. Um, but there's crushes. I don't know, you know, they're they're all shot out of a cannon. I was at an event uh I went to Eman's event. Eman's now, right? co-owner in it, but they had uh they had one of the co-founders fly out and he was in San Francisco, got on a flight, flew to London, literally walked into the event to give his like hourlong talk, ask Q&A, and it was like 2:30 when he was on uh speaking and he was like, "Yeah, our flight's at 4:30." I'm like, "Oh, tomorrow?" He's like, "No, no, today." Like he flew in for like two hours to talk and then flew out. Like those guys are built different. Like they're just I've been to their their old office in New York. Yeah, same. I like those best. Yeah, they're talking about San Francisco and some other stuff. But yeah, there's like some really cool players in this and I like I said, I've tried a couple of them. Well, I don't I'm I don't want to like dox like [ __ ] on anyone, but the other the other one that was like really first to market in voice AI was those internet marketing guys and theirs was rough and bumpy and then what was it air? Yeah, I think air I don't know if they're in business anymore. Yeah, I I would believe if not I don't know those guys person. Yeah, I would believe if not. The only time I got theirs, I worked uh I I have a bunch of uh friends that are in lead genen affiliate that game and they used it for transfers at one point, but like the bill was stacking and like all they were routing and all of a sudden they weren't connecting and it was still built like it was just kind of like a mess uh the actual platform when we used it. But I don't know. U but yeah, I think dude we're down cuz like our buckets right now and you can tell me and probably cuz the people who listen to this are generally speaking generally speaking going to live in info coaching land, marketing offer, like that kind of zone. Uh my like core people that I usually end up talking to are the couple hundredk a month to a couple million a month guys. Like that's kind of my suite of the people I end up actually like really talking to. That's why I make these videos is like have friends like I I sat in this cave and didn't talk to anyone. And now I have friends that are I have friends that crush and like we bounce stuff off each other. We have fun bets on who can hit what cash collected tranch is. Like it's fun. So um but mainly for us in our model it's going to be like when a dial would occur. We didn't have setters until 71 million because we're idiots and we just slammed in closers 30-minute call slots. So like talk about how much more was left on the table. Um and that's Yeah. So for us right now we have setters that exist in three buckets. Setters exist for auto sets, self sets, and confirm sets. So an auto set is somebody who buys a load ticket and then books in like a quick start guide uh call onboarding implementation whatever. Those are 15-minute calls on Zoom. They talk to him about it. Yeah, you got access to the thing. Why didn't you apply for XYZ coaching? They then push them and it's a set. Okay, those are highest show rates, highest close rates, best economics. The biggest issue for us right now is cracking a good cold offer that we can do hundreds the low tickets a day at like a proper cost all unpaid. The next bucket is self-set, which is kind of what you're talking about mainly, which is the true like dial CRM, 100 of them, five pickup, one or two sets, whatever. That's the bucket that we don't utilize the most, which we need to because we have 1.5 million contacts, 500,000 phone numbers, you know, 25,000 customers, call it. And it's like that discrepancy is massive. And then the last one is the confirm set and that's the only place we tried voice directly. And that's when someone books in directly through marketing, through website, wherever. They land in a channel, they claim them, and then they call them within 1 to 5 minutes. And it's, hey, do you know this is a Zoom call? You know, here's what you're going to cover. Kind of like do the DQ a little bit process so it just doesn't clog up the closer calendars. And then if they don't confirm, they mark them as unconfirmed or the event free on the calendar so that the closer can get double booked. So that because the likelihood of them showing up and then you have the closer call and the follow-up and that stuff. But like what you said earlier with the reactivation voice like we we have four maybe 500,000 of those right now. Yeah. Phone numbers sitting in the CRM that have applied because we get we get phone number on application not on optin. Yep. Interesting. So dude, I want to use I want to use this and then I want to make sure that this works and then I want to share with all my friends. Like this is uh Yeah. be my guest, dude. It's um like I said, the tech isn't perfect, right? I'm not claiming to be perfect. I'm never going to I'm never going to say like, oh, we're, you know, obviously I want to sell, you know, make sure companies understand that we have a great product, but um the tech isn't isn't perfect. Obviously, there's going to be some hiccups. Like, we built in stop conditions where like if somebody starts trying to troll it, um it'll hang up the phone or if you ask it how many fingers and toes it has or what it's looking at, it'll say, "Hey, it's here in the office." And and it doesn't sound like a [ __ ] AI. Because the problem if you go to um if you go to retail right now which is one of our competitors that raised I think $10 million or something like that. If you say hey uh what LLM are you built on? Um it'll say I'm built on chat GPT 4.0 and like it's like dude like you can just derail it very easily. Um so with our next uh update we're going to have uh what's going to be called passing the touring test which is the majority of those questions. We're going to build in stop conditions. And it's funny because we have to now build in synthetic lives for the actual AI. Uh but we also provide lead gener essentially lead genen as a service as well. So like let's say you're a merchant lending company, right? And uh you want to contact every single business with a phone in America and you and you're purchasing lead lists, right? We can just batch call 100,000 people at once and it can handle the calls. Yeah, dude. this is going to be. So, it's like condensing 10,000 plus hours of work also with infinite follow-up cadence. So, if you want this thing to call Monday, Thursday, and and Friday to this lead list of 500,000 people, we just set it up and our system [ __ ] takes care of it. It's good to go. Um, so it's it's a fairly interesting business to be in. I think right now our biggest problem I'll I'll tell you our biggest problem is really crystallizing the offer with when it comes as it pertains to the industries that we do business in. Um we have debt collection, merchant lending, real estate. Um like a real estate brokerage could use it to call homeowners in the same way that wholesalers call homeowners and say, "Hey, this is in regard to potentially purchasing your property. Um are you interested in selling or leasing your property?" Right? And imagine if you do that mass scale with millions of phone calls to homeowners and you're a real estate brokerage intern, not an international one, but a national one and you just get listings and roundroin the listings. How much more money can you make? Yeah. Right. It's like infinite scale on the sales side and then also infinite scale on like the on the client side because now we can automate 40 to 60% of the work. Right. Yeah. Um, so we just started talking about that yesterday about doing about how some of these bigger ones especially the ones that have sold all have outbound divisions and one if you don't have like a good ICP or the offer economic like it can't work for some industries right and especially in info coaching a majority it won't work for but if you have like a dialed ICP and you have a dialed offer like the math maths and being able to do that with something like this where you can get the initial touch points you can scrape lists you can do whatever to do essentially the set uh through AI would just make the economics work even at a lower barrier, right? Instead of a 10k offer require a minute, it could be a 5k because the math would math. Um, but that's super interesting. Like I know some people who have tried it in um in the real estate space like you said kind of for like the we buy uh we buy houses cash like that style stuff. Um I I wonder though like so for your offer crystallization for the ICP like what kind of volumes because I know a lot of guys in info I know a lot of guys like in this info coaching game and like I know we would have the volume probably that would make sense for you to like be a good customer but if you're doing like a lot of enterprise stuff or like these kind of heavier buildouts with a lot of volume like does it make sense for somebody who's doing you know where where's the threshold to where it's like yeah this is a lot of like setup or there's a lot of stuff to and only get x amount of dials or x amount, you know, based on your structure. It depends. Um, I mean, obviously like we're in a growth stage, so my thing is we don't say no to money, right? Do you ever say no to money? Depending actually. Yeah. I mean, we'll kick people out. So, maybe if it's going to affect your piece, Sure. Yes. Exactly. If it's going to if it's going to affect the community or like the piece or the person is going to be like the massive headache, yes, we will deny it and usually we'll accept it and then we'll kick them. So, then we'll refund it. But we Yeah. You know what's funny about it for me is that we are taking we want to take on as many clients as possible right now. So I had this thing when I used to do uh the info stuff which was called the golden ratio, right? So how many sales people to fulfillment people do we need in order to keep the scale balanced, right? So I just want to overload fulfillment, right? But um what's beautiful about it is is since we're in such a growth stage, we can take on you know yesterday we took on a very small landscaping company with seven employees, right? Um, but we're also in talks with larger companies and we have larger companies as clients. So, it's like the dynamic between that is I just want to be able to serve every single industry that we possibly can because I just want the entire [ __ ] market. I just want it all. I just I was I was flying back from Philly because I'm from Philly originally and I was flying back and I was watching the the thing about Wei Work, right? And how they lost a bunch of money. Now, that guy Adam Newman was a certified finesser but Oh, that dude finessed billions. But the the thing is is he was like uh we just I remember in the scene in the show he's sitting on the plane he says I'm going to destroy your business and I want the I'm going to take the whole market. He just said let's buy out all of our competitors. And I think AI is in a space right now specifically where there are a few key players in the space. Um I don't think that capability wise they can they're where we are. Um funnily enough because they have a lot of engineers and a lot of investment. Um, but I think that I know marketing and branding and distribution better than every single one of these Silicon Valley companies. Yeah. And like what we're going to do is going to I think be unprecedented. Um, just because I come from the background of marketing and sales and run a business to the level that I want to like I'm either going to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years or I'm going to be [ __ ] bankrupt, you know? That's the game. That's the game sometimes. Yeah. But um we just we I could we could always use more clients, right? We want to be able to service like if we service let's say um a random landscaping company with 10 20 employees or a random roofing company or solar company that has 100,000 leads or 10,000 leads, right? that data that we get on the fulfillment side when we're prompt our prompt engineers are doing their thing and fulfilling it gives us more data on how to do it better because if we have the structure of how we can create our um our AI robots in the proper way the first time then that allows us to systemize which decreases our fulfillment time which allows us to service an industry and just take the entire industry and because we have the the multilingual capabilities because it is AI I um then that means that what works for a landscaping company in Atlanta, Georgia is going to work for landscaping company in Germany or the UK, right? Or Australia or um Sweden, right? And so it allows us to build it. And the actually the main problem we've seen with uh building out the multilingual ones is the grammar because um depending on what the LLM is trained on in terms of grammar um you have to really like you have to you have to have a native language speaker program it in the native language in order to get it. So it's it's a bit of a hurdle to overcome. Um but I'll I'll tell you this this is the most fun I've had in business ever. And um it's interesting because people will look at me and be like they'll know me as like you know teaching how to make money online or like [ __ ] sales or marketing or any of this stuff. And I'll sit there and I'll be like well and they'll probably look at me now or in the next couple years and they they'd be like well David why did you start an AI telecommunications company just because it made sense. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Yeah. Clearly thoroughbred entrepreneur and like the info coaching, right? Sal sales was the vehicle and then info coaching version was the vehicle, then this is the ve like, you know, I mean, you're just taking on bigger and bigger. I love it. I mean, I'm the I'm the classic version of of like this sounds so enticing and so cool to go do and like drop everything and go do. And like I'm trying to practice essentially not even what I preach. I'm trying to practice what I, you know, existent in, which is like just lean in. And I keep saying like go upstream like how how high upstream how how far can you take something? You can take info coaching high, right? You have like you have whales that do billions of dollars that then come through equity agreements and these things and partnerships at scale that the bedrock was info coaching and like I know that we can do that with Mainco. We have partners in that. So it's like I can still do other interesting things with my time and in partnerships. That's why I've been able to do, you know, a video a day and like do all these other things. We we're talking I made a video the other day talking about stacking uh business models and how I'm like so interested in e-commerce. But for me to go start an ecom brand, silly. But for me to take ecom and layer it in instead inside mainco and have it as a portion of what we do, even a front end of what we do, selling a hero product that then goes into info and like one ecosystem within that brand. Like as soon as it's like, oh, let's have a spin-off or something. I'm like, huh. Like I'm not having two HubSpot accounts. I'm not having two company. I'm not doing that. But dude, I love I love what you're doing. I mean, I think it's Yeah, I think I think it's smart. I want to I want to tell you this as well because you'll you're just it's gonna I think you're going to really like it. So, um the way obviously the final question of of what I'm doing is how did I integrate info marketing into running a this actual software business, right? Um so, I've spoken a little bit about it on uh on on YouTube, I think. Um, but it's like a very quiet thing that we're we're doing right now because it's in like pre-launch essentially. Um, so we have an offer where we give you a sales rep. We give you 2,000 leads a month. The sales rep sells the deal for you. We give you a cold outbound system. You can even use synthesis to to dial leads and set appointments. Um, and it's basically people becoming a licensing partner with us. So they're essentially our business partner. They can use it as a bisop to run their own AI business. We do all the fulfillment. We have a fixed flat rate fulfillment fee. We do all the fulfillment. We build the outbound systems for you. It's the same outbound system that we're currently using in the company right now that's making however many calls we're sending. I'm not sure how many emails a month we're sending. I think we're sending 100,000 emails a month right now outbound. Um, but we're scaling up. Um, and so we have this entire thing where it's like we'll give you everything that you need and then you can just simply instead of [ __ ] around with NAN or all these these whatever these people are doing in the AI space right now. You can work with us, you can work with a real founder, me, real company that has real revenue, real clients. They can leverage all of our case studies. Um, and then we'll support them in whatever way they need. And they have a onetoone direct account manager who's their partnership director who actually gets on the calls and sells the deal for them. and they keep the spread on the setup fee and then they're paid 50% of the annual recurring contract value 30 days after um after the deal deal is closed. Right. So I love that. And so it allows us to Thank you. And it allows us to service um all of the markets that we wouldn't usually service. So we're actually we're essentially so not only we're building our internal sales teams because eventually in the next year I want 50 to 100 salespeople. I want people in Sweden selling to Swedish companies in Swedish and Germans selling to Germans and um people in Dubai who speak Arabic selling to other people that speak Arabic and things like that. Um but it allows us to outsource some of our lead genen where they bring us meetings, we close the deal and our margins on that are actually like very very small, right? But what we're doing is like this is part of my master plan where we can just go into the marketplace and just [ __ ] take everything. Yeah. Just own distribution. So, so this is the thing and it's like I doubt that there's any of my competitors that are ever going to watch this, especially because they're all Silicon Valley people, but this is what people I get like 900 views, so you're good. Well, maybe one day this goes goes crazy viral, right? Yeah. Yeah. Later when it's like company sells for 350 million for 10%. And then someone's like, "Oh, you got to watch this OG founder interview." So, what we've done is is and we're actually I'm launching this offer in the next couple weeks, like fully live. Um, so we've we've pre-launched it and we've we've tested it and things like that. So I mean it's not the most inexpensive thing to join, right? But we'll give you the infrastructure. So it's a full infrastructure build for you. And then um there is a little bit of education, but the thing is I said I retired from info, right? I retired from courses. Hey, buy this. We'll give you the coaching. I retired from all that, right? But we will give you the infrastructure and support to make money with AI and you can just partner with us. You don't even need to know how to [ __ ] sell it. You don't need to know a thing about AI. Like, if you can respond to an email and make a phone call, like, you can run this bit. Like, we do everything for you. Um, and so what it allows us to do is really just service the markets. Like, there's there's people like um who are run subcontracting uh roofing companies who are licensing partners of ours, and they can go and sell it to all the roofing companies that they do business with, right? And we give them a kickback, and it's a 50% commission split. It's all in writing. Um, and we're more than happy to do that because I want to grow at all costs. And if I have to sacrifice, if I make 5% margin after I pay every 5% margin pre-tax on on every single dollar that comes in from that from that licensing program, I don't give a [ __ ] because we're getting the clients and we want the distribution. Yeah, dude. That's amazing. So, what's the what's the offer structure? So, is it like free to join or is it like 10K to like learn how to do this and get access to everything or I mean the exact numbers? Right now it's five and it's just for us to do the infrastructure build and for me to pay my people. Um, makes sense. So like right now it's five. I think we're going to go into like probably 10.8 or something like that in that kind of range because if you do the math on it, the unit economics is like we make it absolutely unreasonable for you not to get deals and then the first deal pays for itself. Yeah, exactly. So it's like it's really like I love that. I love that. That means a lot coming from I mean, you made significantly more money than I did in info and and I thought Yeah. Well, no, it's just I I love when people stack I love when people stack the different layers, right? You have acquisition, you have fulfillment, you have monetization, you have, you can look at a lot of ways. You have, you know, uh implementation layers, you have backend versus front end. Like there's different ways to look at this, but what you're doing with acquiring and building the ecosystem on the front like that and doing it through a way that monetizes like a lot of the guys in info coaching like I you know I I respect Cole Gordon a ton on like what he built and like his zone but his whole thing of like people pay to learn and then he can sell those people on the back end so you can like make money from both of them and then there's the ascension and the whole thing like he built a really good model where there was a lot of ways to monetize and a lot of ways to you know squeeze it from all angles and like this is an example of that. obviously completely different industry, different model, but like people pay and it's so hot right now. Um I'm forgetting their I don't even want to call anyone's names out, but there's the guys who teach how to do a AI agencies and what you're saying is true is like they have to do they buy the course for five grand, 10 grand, I don't even know how much they have to learn the classic info coaching stack, which is like how do you acquire customers? How do you service customers? How do you fulfill on it? A lot of people then how do you productize that either through team or then they move into info coaching and then just sell the same thing and then like it's the rinse and repeat versus what you're doing is just like the hands-off almost white label version of it and getting paid to do it and getting paid up front to do it and then everything's performance like butter smooth. And and the funny thing is is uh it the clear differentiation with us is we are not teaching people how to use someone else's software to [ __ ] click around and make little automations and automate something automate a chatbot in the business right we are a global my goal is to be in every single country every single business with a phone like straight up and we are an international AI telecommunications company we're not selling this whole oh AI agents for your business we're we international global telecommunications company. I'm literally in talks right now to make sure that we can be completely approved to do outbound calls on mass in the UAE. And there's a lot of regulatory compliance that that happens there. I was talking about on Twitter the other day, but like we're a real company. We have a real product. We have a real software. We're not teaching you how to use someone else's software that's like a rapper of whatever of some it's like some GPT rapper with like automation, whatever it is. Whatever they're doing, it's a real company, real software. you can come [ __ ] with us, come make money with me and we'll do everything for you. So, it's like very hands-off and also if they want to go and generate leads and they want to do a little bit of work, we more than provide that infrastructure um to do that. And all of our internal so all of our internal sales people for that and our reps are all trained by me and I've got all the sales experience, coaching experience, yada yada yada, whatever. Um, but it's a super interesting model because the offer is there's no other offer like it and I think it's gonna [ __ ] gigakook. Yeah. I think it's at least $510 million on the front end in the next like Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, dude, and then you go the next layer. Like you can go so many layers of this which I love. It's like you can have like then it's how do you acquire customers for that, right? Is it just organic? Is it referral? Is there a paid element? Is there an affiliate element in front of the affiliate? Right? It's like so many ways affiliate 50% affiliate for bringing other people to the licensing program. Yeah. So once you become affiliate once you become a licensing partner you get a 50% link to you get 50% kickback. Um dude I have a lot of beginners or I had a conversation with Iman in uh London and he he said something really good that was like you guys don't understand you guys don't understand like you're selling to beginners. you're selling to beginners and he was like just cuz you price it at 10k or 25k or whatever someone who really does not have experience in xyz like he the example he uses he's like I can make be worth x amount of money or do whatever but like I'm a beginner at tennis and it's like beard's selling me something on tennis and it's 10k like or 25k even if I have the like you know facilities for that I'm still a beginner in that lane and so many of these guys are selling programs that are like that which is fine to do but like if you think that you're trying to sell like B2B or to someone else at that price range They're beginners still and like your model of what you're saying like they can be beginner at that completely beginner in this AI game and whatever and like still afford the 10k still afford the 25 still have like to get into that lane and I have a ton of those people that hit me up that are how do I get started in this oh I'm at XYZ job right the guys who are doing well in their career but like don't want to be in it want to go entrepreneurial want to like you know dip their toe for lack of better words inside of online business and in the space or AI or whatever. Like this is a perfecting offer. I I agree and I I appreciate you saying that because those are all my customers. Those are all the guys that that watch my videos, right? So like I mean from a marketing perspective, like obviously I have a pretty good idea of what I'm doing in terms of like psychoraphics when it comes to our customer base, right? Um but it's even the guys who are running like multi6figure agencies, you know, seven figureure agencies who want to add this as a solution to their offer stack, right? And it's just like a plug and it's just like a plug and play. And you know what's funny is the way I created the offer is like a lot of people when they go into to a new business, they create the offer and then they go and they try to test the offer instead of just having the customers or the potential customers just tell them what they should sell. Yeah. And so what I did was like I remember I dropped a few months ago I dropped like hey like this is this I had this idea to sell a course on how to do an AI agency which was the infant kind of conversational AI solution that we were selling. Um, and then I'm like, well, okay. Well, let's call it a I don't know if you know you know Randors. Okay. So, he bought consulting.com from Sam. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I do know that. Sorry. I didn't know that's how you pronounce his name, but yes, I still get his email. So, my boy DJ Penfilly, who's a G, he's like I think one of the best copywriters on planet Earth. Um, he's moved into doing marketing for private equity now. Um, but he was um he's a good friend of mine and we bounce ideas off each other all the time and he he was like, "Oh, like you should just say it's like a franchise model." I'm like, "Well, we can't say it's a franchise. It's illegal." Three buckets. Franchise, this, this, and this. It's not a franchise. Um, but it's a licensing system where you can license, you know, you can purchase a license to sell our our product to your clients. And the unit economics makes sense. And so what I did was I dropped this landing page. It was just, you know, hey, fill out this form. Um, why are you interested in AI? And then I just called everybody myself for like 2 three days and I was like, "Hey, um, here's what we got going on. Here's what we're working on." Um, and then I'm like, "If you want to sell, like if you want to do this," and I tested the offer and they're like, "Oh, well, what if I don't know how to sell it? We'll give you a sales rep. Uh, what if I don't have leads?" We'll give you leads. Um, what if what's the commission for? Well, it's 50%. And then it's like, well, why why are you doing this in the first place? And it's like because there are so many companies that we can sell this to that even if I have 10,000 employees, I can't service them all. Yeah. Right. Um but we can certainly scale it on both ways. So like now it's like we're building um we're building our B2B team, our B2B sales team, we have a team of developers, we have designers, we have uh fulfillment people, prompt engineers. Um I don't really know how many people are in the company right now. I should know this. I don't know. Um, but we're expanding very fast and then also now we're going to launch the the licensing system. So, there's going to be more employees, more infrastructure, different layers of management, which is all super fun. Um, but I just think I I just it's it's fun to me to be able to do this. And the what I've noticed most importantly after all of this is like the game is still the game no matter which way you want to cut it. whether you're in tech, whether you're in in marketing, whether whatever it is, the end of the day is make good offers, create great products, and do right by your customers. And that's that's really and then figure out every little optimization, technical efficiency, every little data point. Track your data, track your numbers. Um, that's actually something I wanted to ask you about with the info stuff is like how important numbers to you, bro. I am. You could ask me any number up until a little bit into fulfillment and I could give it to you in 02 seconds. Like any What's your failed payment rate on subscription? Failed payment rate. Well, because we don't have that issue. We don't have a low ticket for that doesn't count. So, we don't we don't track that. Why? Because we have no we we only do 50 low tickets a day right now and it's like four to six weeks into like us actually scaling into it on the subscriptions. We don't have subscriptions. Oh, okay. Okay, so there's no low ticket sub for the high ticket subscription. That's a different story. And like that's like more of a retention rate number than a failed payment number. Um I will say the this is kind of a funny stat, but the majority of our refund rate comes from the auto bills that happen after one year even though we send them nine different things and now we have a conversation that happens. So now it's like this like on the portion of it, but for the longest time like they sign up for something that's 5 grand, 7 grand, whatever a year and then they get auto build for it a year later even though the reminders go out even though we you know we're supposed to be having the conversations. I mean we have 4,000 active clients. So it's like you assume that it's happening through the coach and it wouldn't and then they'd be like I didn't want to get rebuild. I don't want to continue for year two and then we refund that. So like that was a big piece of our thing that we've solved for now proactively. Um, but that was a big one. But like dude, the marketing stats, the flow between the percentage of app to booking, like so for us, for the AI, for example, the applied to book for us right now is sitting at call it 60%. And you'll hear the other guys that talk about embedding the booking widget inside the application, it's 100%. It's like, okay, but is the throughput the same? Like, you know what I mean? Like instead of having two pages, you have one. Like if the person doesn't want to book, the person's not going to book. But for us, that's where we get the phone number and they haven't completed the next step. So that's where the AI hits and now we have setters that hit. Um, but that was a super interesting one for us for a long time. Um, we introduced phone number on optin, but because we didn't have AI solutions that like really really worked, the drop in opt-in uh percentage. The other thing is consumption. So for us, a big thing with the VSSL opt-in funnel is you get their name and email, they watch the VSSL, but then it takes X amount of time. We email, we have the contextual flows for where they're at, vither opt, apply, book, whatever. But then we also have two emails a day that are going to go out every single day to that warm list of whatever 200,000 people of the 1.5 million and they are getting pushed to resource links that we have tons of content that we output. So even though we don't have like organic in terms of like first click, we have so much organic that exists for middle and bottom of funnel that they can just get lost in this web of content and watch for hours and testimonials and long form and like we have uh four different buckets of like testimonial reviews. Top is like a textbased. Next is a photobased and it's like the volume of them decreases as you go. But it's like the most are text. Then it's like before and after. Then it's selfie video that they've submitted of them doing a review which are like actually the hottest converting because they're easy like snippet to consume. Classic brain rot. And then the smallest amount but the most consumption are long form customer interviews that are 30 minutes to an hour. So we'll include all of these in like the blast they get and they consume all this content. So well I I say this all to say in the beginning or not in the beginning but uh what is it June a year and a half ago probably we tested doing a phone number on opt with a couple setters to try and dial them and that it dropped 25% even if it was optional for the opt-in rate and that spread versus what we got back from those phone numbers and like what the the then went to app and booking was like not it the throughput didn't math and I think a big reason on that even if we did hit them all even if we did call them all in a minute or five minutes or whatever the biggest thing was the consumption wasn't there. So, they didn't then come into the ecosystem, just give us their name and email, watch the video on their own time, click on the emails on their own time, live within that world, and then ascend, which is a little bit different because they're leads versus buyers. And for us on buyers, something from low ticket, we have a killer ascension rate right now on low ticket because they'll book in this low ticket uh uh you know, implementation call. They'll talk to a setter, then they'll talk to a closer, but a lot of them are also coming from that 1.5 million that are somewhere on the internet that then will see our thing and come in and it just lights up. It's like the the cost per lead or the cost per purchase is great on leads, but on new leads, it's like not. So, it's almost acting a bit as like a retargeting more consumption method. So, they're just ready. And like a 37 is an entry point. But yeah, I mean, we religiously track the stats. Uh we use HubSpot and then we use some like other kind of offshoot tools for some of that. And then what we're doing right now is we just hired a company and we're doing a full data like rebuild. We're going full data lake that's connected to HubSpot. So it's going to be those two are like the source of truth now. Um because there's a ton of stuff on fulfillment that we haven't mastered on like activation points when a perfect time to call them is for the renewal. Um on a perfect rate for like a lot of stuff like that on like what is right now what do we owe in coach pays this month? Like all that's easy to do in terms of like true cash, but like metrics behind like managerial like operational level data doesn't exist very well for backend and that's like where I think we're going to break next. Like you said, what's going to break? I want to break fulfillment. I want to break sales. Right now sales is the broken piece. Marketing is kind of breaking sales. Once sales is dialed, it's like market or fulfillment is going to break. So I'm trying to like get ahead of that and then also reduce the leaky bucket syndrome and make sure that the conversions are in place so we can get the LTV that we need on the influx that's going to come in. So that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. I remember when I to to that point, I remember when I got taught how to look at numbers and it changed the way that I sold and that's how I look at everything. Um my friend, very good friend of mine. Um his company for the longest time is doing about 30 million a year. Um and he was running it for a number of years and he said, "You need to run the business off three spreadsheets." So there's one spreadsheet that's like, how do I explain it? It's like sales, then links to like the fulfillment, and then links to one that you can just read on your phone and you know exactly where every single metric point in the entire business is. And it's like it's super cracked. Um that is the easiest way to run the entire thing. Yeah. I like if you because you can't if you track everything, you you have to be able to understand what the data means, right? And the interpretation of the data is important. When I was doing low ticket recurring, um a 3% change in turn rate would be thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. Yeah. Right. And so you have to like you have to manage this stuff. Even even like for the beginners or guys that are watching this because I know you're you're blowing up on Twitter right now. The guys that are watching this like you they may not understand what you just said. The entire idea of that is like you have to track all these different key data points. So because everything that exists within a macro and micro KPI and then you have to track all these things so you know where exactly where to improve. Yeah. I know for a fact if we're if our receivables are down that we need to do a better job of collecting more money on the front end, right? Or we need to do a better job in follow-up, right? Or if we have all these meetings and then you know there's a low close rate, I know that we need to do X Y and Z. And so it's just it's everything is just a a part of a larger hole and uh you have to 100% manage the business in a way where you understand exactly what's going on. Like sales side, right? Um we're working on expanding international teams right now. So, I have a spreadsheet that allows me to track I I can see how many seconds the sales rep has called for and I can see what phone number on what day and it links to my spreadsheet where I can see them all ranked. And then we send that into the sales chat where we can see it's green and then red at the bottom and we can see who's underperforming. We'd see how many unique dials they've made versus how much they're bullshitting. And I can see the lag time. I can see every little thing. And um it's important to have that because from a sales management perspective, from a management perspective of the entire business, if you don't track it, you don't know how to improve it. Yeah, dude. We got to a point where I was almost like too into that and everything was everything was firing in completely automated and almost to the point that uh back to what you said the the or like how I interpreted it is like the like you said the interpretation of the data. But for me it's like how does it drive behavior? It's like you can track every number in the book, but if it doesn't change behavior. So, it's we were tracking so many things and so many automated that people didn't feel like they own the data or they owned the metric. And like literally a month ago, I was like, everyone needs to like respond an emoji to the daily thing that fires in that has new cash, trend lines, uh CPA number. Like I have all of these in dashboards that have come through. Sales reps get like a looker that pulls their everything from close rate down to like exact commissions. They have bonus pools. We gamified like all that stuff. Like you guys need to acknowledge these. We had a new sales manager come in and was like asking everyone their close rates and they didn't know. And it's like they've been they've been there but like it just wasn't what the other manager uh like led with or like really pushed into. He was much more like personal development side which there's a place for for sure. Um but like pushing in a direction of uh you know metric driven. So yeah, it's funny you say that but ours ours does that. And because we've been stuck on the hamster wheel of acquisition for a long time, the numbers we look at is like I have a I have a tool that crawls the uh Google calendars across all the sales reps and shows how many open spots there are on day. So because we're so paid marketing driven, like it has to be, you know, 90% efficiency where you're 90% booked on day every day and you're threading this needle of like uh marketing spend and the time from lead to booking or from spend to booking and like navigating that down to CPAs, the trend line. So, we've looked at those forever and now I'm going to do that on the back end because it hasn't fully existed. And like I said, the quick math is we left 30 million on the table uh probably of just who just and I'm literally just basing that off of total one to one uh high ticket clients and then current. So like the churn essentially of what we've missed. I'm like oh my gosh like if we converted 30% of those which is like now our number let's say on what we are like retained because fitness is funny though because it's like if you get the result or you don't get the result they leave, right? It's like if they if they achieve XYZ body, it's like they're good to go kind of. So that's why this offering is like you get you keep the community, you keep the access, but you don't need the personalization and then the people who don't like it are just going to bounce anyway or just like similar to dating offers. Similar Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Very true. Very true. So yeah. Um No, dude. It's an interesting game. It's it's it's so crazy. So it's so crazy. Your business is very very interesting because you have it literally down to a science, right? Yes. And um what I wanted to say was uh I had I had another question for you. So how much of that like when you say about when you were talking about layering in e-commerce to that right um how focused are you now about maximizing LTV like within the time frame that they're so that's my yeah that's going to be my next like so that makes sense right that question. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So more more globally what I'm trying to do is also like this layer of doing it through leaders. So putting the right people in place and sacrificing cash now for this future vision again for like pushing the can you know kicking the can down the road but like I want people who kind of have done this before for a long time we hired people and grew within like an Eman thing again I'm just going to use this as an example because it's hot on the mind but like his team has grown from within the company and that's one of the things they like pride themselves on is like a setter is now in seuite right like and they and they crush but for us where we did that for a long time and now two or three of the last key hires are people who have done it outside and have come with the experience and you kind of pay the price um especially in like the bases but like if you tie the performance correctly it's fine. So I say that to say the next iteration of this is like we solved for marketing, we're solving for sales right now and the next for sure is going to be fulfillment and that's where the focus is going to be this LTV these partnerships. We tried to do a partnership in the past for the supplement side of things and I wasn't like we were still kind of running this as a cash flow biz. I had other stuff I was also focusing on. So like I just saw it as like oh cool it's a bolt-on thing where we can make some more money. It's an MR play because they'll get on supplements with this partnership. But I literally missed out on the simplest simplest aspect of the initial cost to do the partnership with them than the downstream effects of that or how much it would take to essentially get out of the trough. And so the example exactly was we there's a lot of people who do this but like 10X Health um PMPA does it like where they do the test kit. So they basically you buy a test kit from them, they ship it to you, you pee on the stick or you, you know, swab or you do whatever. You send it back and then they do a consultation with you that's like here's what's wrong or here's what's whatever and then they sell you XYZ program or XYZ supplements. Okay? So we found a really really high quality partner to do this with, but we were paying for the test kit, the hormonal test kit, the whole thing out out of the initial purchase and we didn't increase the pricing. So let's say we're selling it for 5gs. This was I think like 250 bucks roughly, let's say. So every customer that was coming in, we were just ripping 250 right off the rip and then they get sent a test kit after x amount of months of us and like for the last year was like one point whatever that we paid in these kits that we paid out for our customers like just right off the rip just straight from the bottom line. Everything is a funnel. Every sales process, every everything is a funnel. The metrics you say. So it's like, okay, we sent out 100% of the kits of the purchasers. Okay, so now you're going to even have people who refunded or whatever. We already paid for the kit and like we're out more money. Let's just say the 5% people that refund. The next layer is how many people sent the kits back. It was like 50%. So it's like we just burned 500 grand right off the rip on these test kits that no one sent back. The next layer is once they set it back, how many got on the phone call? So like a showed call with the consultation. It was like another 50%. So now you're dealing with like 25%. You're dealing with 250k that you should have spent. You spent one. We're using a million as simple math, but like now I'm out a million dollars and I have only the opportunity of 25% to even sell them. Then when they would sell them, it was the classic 30% rate or whatever. They sold them supplements and then AOV and uh the AOV is XYZ. It's an MR. So you're like, "Oh, cool. I'll make it up in the long run." And then the commission rate was like 40 points. You do all that math down and it's like I have to jam a million dollars out of whatever 14% of the people in MR play and you know in the end we made like 100 grand in commissions so far and there's some MR and like it'll slowly make its money back but like it'll never it'll never surpass what it was let alone and that's out of the trough. That's not even out of like new money. Makes a lot of sense. It makes sense in hindsight. It makes sense in hindsight for me but like so we cut the partnership. we did whatever and again great company and great brand but like just the the partnership didn't ma ma like math out and I wasn't ahead of it to look at it I just agreed to it someone else that was in uh product brought it to our attention like sounds cool sounds good just an add-on a bolt-on so now how I'm structuring it and looking at it we're like we're going to have a bigger offering on the front end that does all the blood testing the kits the clinic that thing which is like again you sell it for 15 grand more and it costs whatever difference and like that thing we're going to have a partnership we want to go in house but what does that look like do I have half a million in SKUs sitting on a shelf somewhere in a 3PL like I don't know if I want to play that game right so then it's like okay is it partnership again or is it we own a portion of said company and then it's really just a post-purchase sell like the hormosi classics like okay cool they sign up for your thing and it's like do you want chocolate or vanilla and it's like you just get them on $250 a month and the supplements they're already going to buy the other thing in our demo is HRT and there's some other things we very we stay away from JLPs that's like completely against our ethos and like part of the marketing against but like HRT we're cool with all the supplements ments, the creatines, the protein powders, the vitamin D, like those things they already take and they're going to buy from someone. So, like, how do we do it in a way that doesn't cost us cash or sit in inventory and maybe we do go that way, but like if we're going to do that, we want to go hero product, so we can do our we're a direct response company like kind of like at the at the core, we can rip on spend. We can spend 100 grand a day. Like, let's go. Like, we have the team and the capacity. So, yeah, dude, we're just playing that game. We're playing that game. Um I remember that my friend bought uh he bought some supplements from Gregor Gallagher and he got a sales call from somebody trying to sell him on a program like as when it comes to his door. Right. So it's a similar it's definitely a similar thing. Yeah. And we're trying to do it like included on the back end, but there's a total play to do it on the front end. Like we just have to come up with what is the supplement and we're so so big on like brand and quality that to just slang like someone's [ __ ] supplement that we get 80% commission on because they have the room and the margin. Like we're not going to do that. But there's a big I get asked this a lot because there's a lot of ecom guys that'll follow me, but it'll be like, "Do you see like I hear you talk about how you're going to go info to supplement, but uh is there a way to go like physical product supplement to info?" And you just said like exact example like yes, there definitely is a play. I I think you guys are big enough to the point where um you don't have to sling someone's [ __ ] supplement. I think that brands like Bionic or AG1 would be very interested in in at least having a conversation with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. I think there and and there are good supplements out there that we love. I mean, we take supplements all of us. Like we're not women and whatever, but like we all are very fit. Like we have a walking the walk channel in our company and it's everyone's doing their you know lifting this uh you know XYZ cardio. Like we are a fit company and we all take our own thing. Like I take uh Nick Bear stuff. I take BPN that's like my three stack that I like. Um I know a lot of them. I talked to Rob Lipet a couple days ago. He's Ghost and he loves their stuff. I talked to Yeah. Yeah. I talked to the um XYZ people. I don't want to say their thing, but they, you know, there's Raw. There's like some of that stuff. Like there's a lot of big guys out there. Um our space, it's it's very funny though like niche and what you said like taking on whoever. Initially it was we were selling the methodology and the messaging and who it landed with. So we had everyone from someone who was like 18 to 20 up to like 70. And then as we continued down this route, we were like seeing who got the best results, who the top like who it resonated with most. And our main like co-founder brand face is 35 right now. But a majority of our demo was 40 to 60 that was purchasing that got the best results that was in that pocket. So we moved all of the messaging to like we only sell 40 to 60 year olds. We changed all the testimonials on site and we just like highlighted that and that was a huge lift for us. So now we have two brand faces that now have joined the team that are in that 40 to 60 demo that are still macros, menopause, uh mindset, muscles, like [ __ ] cardio, eat more carbs, strength train, strong as the new sexy, like that vibe and we're using them on the front end and it's crazy good. It's crazy good for us because now it's like the the resonance. So yeah, dude, I'm excited. I love I love what you have. We're gonna have to we have to talk offline because I need to come up with something. Yeah, it's it's interesting. The last thing I'll say is like um I actually I did a brief stint in ecom and uh we're restarting the ecom brand where we have um basically we're selling Disney and Pokemon and and Marvel and everything uh online in the Middle East. Um long story but you're licensing in like proper proper green light or just gray proper proper green light like $10 million in inventory stocked in a way out like proper green light. Um, so the thing is is is now uh what the thing I live like I said I lived half the year in Dubai. I was in Dubai last week and I flew I'm here in my place in LA and I flew back and I'm I'm thinking I said well I want to start Synthesis Commerce the phone as a marketing channel in the same way the email is marketing channel. What better way to do it instead of going out and hitting up all my friends who have drop shipping brands and like yeah run your own ecom always being like yo can can we try this? we're just going to validate it um with, you know, SMS, infinite SMS on WhatsApp, with a phone call, um with just insane levels of scale to all of our customers that come through, you know, our different channels that we're going to be selling on. And I'm in the process right now of getting everything um restarted. But that's my next project for my development team is to develop that and then offer an affiliate model to all the big drop shipping gurus and the guys that sell on ecom and just have that same structure of the Gregory Gallagher thing. When you purchase supplements, somebody calls you to upsell, customer reviews, anything like that. Yeah. Anything, right? You pick the CTA, right? It's like you you have info coaching, you have more supplements, you have just reviews, you have like whatever. But it's just such a that's a such a good channel. There was a guy, he built the You remember JG Wentworth 877 cash? So, my mentor, I call him one of my mentors. Um, and I only had a few conversations with him, but he was that Yeah. He doesn't know, dude. I have plenty of those. He doesn't know he's my mentor, but like he is. Yeah. He's at he's at another very big company now, but he buil he he built the sales team for JG Wentworth and then went to the merchant lending company and the merchant lending company eventually got acquired by PayPal, right? Okay. [ __ ] gangster, bro. And I remember I'm sitting there, it was when I first I was 22 and I'm sitting there in his office with him. We were drinking whiskey after work on a Friday and u I said I said, "What's your job?" And he goes, "Well, I'm basically figuring out how we can integrate the merchant lending with the other side of PayPal, like the company, right?" And he said, "Everything has to work together. Everything has to be an ecosystem. The one thing has to work with the other thing works with the other thing works with the other thing. It changed that statement has changed the way that I've thought about business forever. Everything is an ecosystem. And I call it e ecosystem thinking. You have to build stuff that works together and if you don't you're wasting your time, right? Because when I was trying to build the ecom brand on the side then also do info and courses doesn't make sense, right? It's like a little side project, right? But if everything works together where it's becoming a greater hole or it gives you reference experience or valuable data points that you can input into whatever the [ __ ] it is you're doing the big thing you end up winning. And so that's anybody's watching this regardless if they're worthund $100 million or you're doing 100 m in revenue or zero in revenue you have to think about how things work together because everything compounds. Yeah. See that it's so funny. I say I call it interest mapping was how I I called it on here but it's like same thing. It's I had all these opportunities when I got back and I'm like, "Oh, maybe I'll do like real estate or I'll do this or this." And I and I looked at real estate and I was like, "Okay, cool. There's like the tax zone of it, which is a different thing, like just investing in it for that or there's the active zone." And I'm like, that one has the least similarity with what I'm doing over here to where it's like I'm almost I'm not like wasting my time, but like if I can do something in ecom for example, that has a 60% flow over of even just thinking of like how I'll like the skill stack that I'll learn, let alone the actual direct business like we're talking here ecom directly inside the ecosystem or inside the brand like as long so like I play in lead genen world a lot and affiliate like I have a bunch of friends over there and like I look at the paid media side and it's like how can we implement that in info coaching paid media or I play over here with this thing. Like as long as they can play together like you're saying and the skills that I learn in one I'll buy courses on something and just eat it in a weekend and I'm like, "Oh, cool. These two pieces we put into here can lift us 3% and like that's hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. Like it pays for the 5k course I bought over the weekend or whatever." Like yeah, literally. Yeah, dude. You're cool. You're Yeah, you're a cool guy. I like how you think. I like I like what you're building. I appreciate that, bro. I appreciate that, too, man. You're very cool. Oh, we'll have to we'll do a we'll do a follow-up on one of these. I have one 17 minutes ago, but we have uh we'll do a follow-up on this once you are are cooking through and then yeah, I'll connect with you offline because there's going to be there's definitely I want to test it for our stuff and then I know a bunch of people that I think this will play with. Amazing. Amazing. I'll uh I'll text you my number and uh we'll go from there. Thank you for uh having me on. It's absolute pleasure, Ryan. Yeah. Thank you for uh you know soft launching on here. I appreciate that. No problem, man. All right, man. I'll talk to you soon. Thank
