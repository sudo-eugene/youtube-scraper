# the man behind $10M in low ticket... (Josh Gavin) | EP68
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YmRV9vlIok

I mean, most of these just started just me having a good time. So, what is up? All right. In today's video, we are talking with Josh Gavin. Josh owns Low Ticket Offers and Offerpublisher.com. Both of them. Half the time they don't work when I click on them, but you know, it's a Click Funnels 2.0 life. All right, Josh, kick it off. These are not interviews. These are not the classic anything. This is going to be what's the current biz, what's the goal, what's working now, strategies, tech, just jam. So, give the quick one minute. Who are you? Yeah. Name is Josh Gavin. Currently 23 years old as of a few months ago. Last 12 months, I've helped launch over 500 low ticket offers in every market imaginable except sketchy woo woo and self-development stuff I don't believe in. Uh my first million-dollar offer I ever created was in right before COVID 2020. I was 18 years old for piano forproducers.com. It was a low ticket funnel, no high ticket on the back end. Uh, and since then, I mean, most solos get offers that are currently live on the ad library have my hand in it through consulting, done for you work or or something else. And it's a true honor and I'm still student of the game. I I text Ryan questions and Blake, you guys see him all the time. So, I'm by no means made it. Uh, and I'm still learning and I'm excited to be here. Yeah. Two questions. One, you did a million dollars on a piano offer. Yeah. I mean, me, I published, I helped put together. Okay. Well, okay. So, this is like a lot of the questions I get in the forums on on X and stuff. Like, not to call it out, but like the 0 to 10K style thing is like, how do I find an expert and how do I like build this around them? And like I didn't do that, right? Like Luke did that and then I came on after. I didn't have the wherewithal to realize that was a thing. And then, so that's what your entire thing is. That's what I that's my business model now. I would call it you could call it whatever. I call it a publishing company. So, I'm an offer publisher is the identity I take on. Um, some people confuse that with being a growth operator. What's the difference? The thing is growth operators don't own anything. You can still get fired. Like you can you don't own the you don't own the payment processing. You don't own the banking. You don't know the funnel. So everyone's like, "Are you operating? I own the banking. I file the tax return. I own the funnels. I own the list. And if the face wants to leave, then I go find a new face." And I introduce the list to a new name and I keep running the offer. So all these operators are like at risk. I didn't realize that. Okay. So you do it where it's branded. So like you you'll say, let's use the piano one. You can use the name, but we're call.com just for simple. So you're going to take piano.com. You're going to buy the domain. You're going to own it. What's the process? You then find somebody who does. So this just happened the other day. My next deal that's in the process. I I sit around and I actually don't know these answers by the way. I didn't even Yeah. No, I know you're genuinely curious, which is going to make this better. Um so the other day I was sitting around and I'm a creative person, so I'm always thinking up new offers, looking at the market, and people like, "How do you come up with new offers?" I mean, it's just like any other entrepreneur does. You look for problems in the market and you dream up solutions. Then you go figure out a way to assemble it. So, I'm sitting here and I have this idea for a really good offer and I'm like, "Okay, what would I call it?" And I think of the name and I'm like, "Oh, that's a really good name." So, I go buy the domain for $12 and then I sit on it and I just wait for to come across somebody who's an expert in that field. uh if I'm not desperate for a deal like right now I have deals in my pipeline so I'm not actively searching but if someone comes across that fits that domain then I'm like let's go and so literally that domain literally that do so so or could be so this is funny because we did it I was on the podcast we did at the event in Dallas and I was on X and I replied to someone's lead magnet where they were like comment this if you want this download right just classic engagement baiting I'm like you know what freak it I'm going to do it I ever comments on these things, but I did it this one time. And I get a DM from the dude and he's like, "Dude, I just saw your podcast with Ryan. Uh, you should help me with low ticket." I'm like, "Uh, I'm not doing any client work, but you know, sorry, but then I looked more into his stuff." And I'm like, "Wait, wait, hold up. I just bought this domain literally today and I think you'd be perfect for it. Can we get on a call?" So, we get on a call and I pitch him my idea and I'm like, "Can you make this product?" All I say to the expert is this is what I want to sell. Can you make something that can fulfill on this promise I want to make to people? And they say yes or no. If they say yes, then I work with them and we figure out if it's legit or not and we start building. So I'm literally texting him and say we're building the product out. Um and the idea and he's like, "Yep, I can get it done." And he's someone wants to move fast. Screenshot zoom that and swipe it. Who is it? Who is it? Um but so then I will own everything. Walk me through the exact though. Okay. So that's that's story that's story time about it and that's that's interesting. So that's that's how it starts. But I can walk you through like step by step like newbie. Yeah. Cuz I actually I seriously I don't understand this. So you own the IP, you own the banking, you own the LLC. Okay. So you own the domain, you buy it, you find an expert to then come in and be in it. Yeah. Sometimes the domain comes and it doesn't have to be an exact deal because then you also teach this, right? Yeah. Yeah, we teach it. I mean to be honest, you teach it and then you also do it. I publish someone who teaches it. This is where it gets more meta. So, my mentor who taught me this at 17, Mark Lack, publishes the biggest people in the world. So, we're talking celebrities, Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul, uh, uh, Alex, what's his name? Not Alex Becker. Those guys have info products. Because of him, they do. Crazy, right? I didn't know they had info products. So, my boy Mark Lack at when I was 17, he took me under his wing. This is like five years ago, and taught me this model. And then for the last years, I've been just doing it. And I was like, "Yo, Mark, can I publish you practice what you preach to teach this?" So now I publish Mark. I'm a coach inside the program, but I in this like I practice what I preach. I own the I own everything. So Mark's a face, but I own everything. So I publish my mentor on publishing. Super meta. It's like coaches selling coach on. But this is like legit. You're one of those one of those guys. That's one of that's me. Um but no, it is so. So anyways, I own it all. my mentor self, my banking, everything. I pay out to him. He's there. So, I can walk you through how we do this step by step. Yeah, we do teach it. Mark teaches it. I'm a coach because I do. Yeah. And this is again, and I didn't say this, but I mean, we'll attempt to not dox or do anything with anyone's like actual numbers, obviously. But like structurally speaking, I get this question all the time. So, how does the what's the deal structure usually look like? Yeah. So, I think the most or you and an expert, if you own everything, if I own everything, we'll do a 5050 profit split. profit. Profit interesting profit because we got ad spend, we've got tech and so depending now every deal is different, but what we start with when I go out to the market, I want somebody who's like, "Yeah, let's do 50/50." Now, with the situation with Mark, I actually own more than he does. Um, I would think that's normal. Yeah, it's different. Now, I I know some other people you do 7030, but if you're like a beginner coming into it, you don't have results like I do, you have to kind of make it seem fair to them. And sometimes you even have to like my first deal, my first deal was I got 30 and they got 70 cuz I was like a nobody. Yeah. So, the deal structures you're saying, hey, profit and people, it's so it's kind of crazy. It's kind of sad cuz I used to not know the difference like what profit was, but it's people sometimes get so confused. It's super easy. I mean, it's just you have the revenue that comes in minus expenses, profit. You split that. All right, guys. Let's just look in chat VT. That's what profit is. But you don't know how many times I have to answer that in the DM. So, that's a split. Now, um again, depending on where you're at in your journey will dictate how much you can demand and own. Now, I've kind of gotten to the level where I can say, "Hey, if you want to work with me, I'm owning everything." And they're like, "Yeah, I want to work with you." Um, and then there's some people where you're newer and you may have to say, "Hey, I'm going to own the tech stack, the list, the marketing assets, the ad accounts, everything. I'll let you handle the payment processing because you don't really know me and trust me yet, but I'm still going to control everything else." So, that's pretty standard. But we have students, dude, that go out and they're signing people with millions of followers and they're owning everything and they're nobody. They didn't have results before. So, it's it's not impossible. Yeah. When people ask me, I'm always like, "Oh, yeah." Like it's it's so when we were starting this Yeah. I was in consulting.com whatever group. I talk about this all the time. That's where I met Luke. And like I didn't have the wherewithal to do that, right? And he didn't teach that directly. It was about you becoming the consultant. It wasn't about like partner partnering doing anything like that. Finding an expert. And a lot of the time, let's be real, a lot of it was like consultant to consultant or like B2B, you know, if they even call it that. It's like B to whatever. It's like B2B sells B to I don't know. It's like a weird thing. Yeah. But I mean in I mean I buy a lot of that stuff because I think that there and there's totally space for that. Like the people in the room at the at that mastermind were like oh yeah we sell you know who's bought from each other in here and it's like someone else dominates podcast someone dominates YouTube ads. Someone do so like there's a place for it for sure. It's like the BTOC guys that teach like how to make money online and they only make money by making money online like that kind of thing where I'm not a super fan but like everyone's got their own thing and I'm not here to hate. So, like, but I bought that and then we bought Cosman's course and then we bought uh I bought Becker's course. So, Becker had like this low-key course at the time that was like a Trojan horse for Hyros because it was like up and running now in like a full software but still not like obviously anywhere it is today. And uh in there he talked about doing that and he was like how he did that was some guy in Shopify make money online and he did that and owned 70% I think and the other guy he just gave all the scripts gave all the stuff he shot he was in the ads and he did it and I was like oh that's an interesting idea and then literally at the same time I like meet you know Luke and doing that so it's it's nothing but that was a 7030 deal is where I was going with that. Sorry, my brain trouble. But like it's so like where the the 70 of the marketer, owner, operator, whatever you call it. Yep. Yeah. And so what's funny is this model or mechanism like we can make it sound shiny and new because no one's heard of it or it sounds new and shiny, but it's been around forever. I mean, I was just watching or reading a story of Weight Watchers and she got published by somebody. Mhm. And so if you guys look at the original story, she started doing stuff in her home. She started these little groups or like community groups. She'd help people lose weight and she's just doing it for free. Then a businessman comes along and he's like, "Why aren't you charging for this?" And she's like, "I don't know. I'm just an expert." I was like doing helping people. And he's like, "All right, well, let's partner together." And they built that up to a massive company. Um, and it was acquired by Hines in like the 70s when their private equity. Yeah. Hines bought it in the 70s. Ketchup. Uh yeah. Yeah, I think so. They were like doing private equity back then. Um and then Oprah bought a 10 percent stake and became the face of the brand that Oprah as well really did that. Yeah. So, but before that I was making millions of dollars and they're huge and so it just shows you like dude this has been around forever and I talked to these OGs in the game and the guys who are quietly making money behind the scenes like they're just low-key operators. This is the path they took too because they don't want to show their face. They don't want to be out in public. They like to just operate behind the scenes. And so, um, we're just now just introducing this model more publicly, but you know, it's not I'm not sitting here like, "Yeah, I'm first." Like, no, no, for sure. But this just goes to show that it works. Like, for realistic, should I do this? Will this last? It's like, yeah, it's just uh it's almost like Jay Abraham talks about finding ways to do strategic partnerships and getting creative. And I just think of it as assembly. Like, I'm just assembling things. I'm assembling an expert in marketing and making money. It's like arbitrage. It's like drop shipping. I'm drop shipping experts. Yeah, drop ship.com. What is the I don't want to say the biggest one like that, but what a lot of people who are and I probably should have started with this, but I'm new to this. Um, most of the people, not most, but there's a lot of people in the DMs that are mid6 figure already, high seven figure a month guys that are like in my world. So like yeah, zero to 10k guys a lot of time want to know how they get in the space, how they do that. For sure. Like I think that's a great model. I mean clearly we did it. I mean I didn't directly do it but I was part of it. But what do we like? How do we need to convince anybody else? Like people are what are you doing? Like you think you have to do client work. Oh, I got to do my freaking client work, dude. Client work on the side to fund your publishing deals. That's what I did. And now I don't have clients telling me to do anything. I own everything. I can fire my experts and put a new face on it, which I'd never do. But like, well, that's where I'm going to go with this right now. So these six, seven figure guys are like, "Okay, cool. That's that's fun." Uh, or like we already did this and now we're here. So question for you direct. And we literally went got in a Twitter funniness debate. Oh yeah. What was that about? Depth. It's like why are you doing 14 of these when you can have one with one face or three faces and do five or 10 million a month? What's you have to ask yourself what's the purpose of that deal? Um some products if you own 70 Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's here's the thing. Um there's Yeah. Yeah. So it's all about like where are you going towards? Like what's your mission? Like I I think of things differently where there's some markets I want to be in. Like I'm I'm a creative person. So you have to ask who you are as a person. Like you you can sit at your desk from 5:00 a.m. till now and grind for one person, not get bored. We're only 14 hours in for one person, right? You can do that because you're not like me on the wealth dynamics from a creator and I'm thinking a million different offer ideas all over the place. Like me and Mark, we are more so the creative people. We're see dude we want to be in everything. And we get bored if we're in for one thing. And so some people I envy it. I envy it. I think so. No, but here's the thing. I envy you cuz I wish I could just sit with one person. That's always greener, brother. Exactly. So here's the thing. Why don't I stick with one? Well, who are you as a person? I'm just not that person. So what do I do? What do I do? I broker deals now to people who are. So I can why like why say no to a deal when I can broker and keep 10% of the profits and hand it to a publisher who's going to be like you and be like Luke and scale it up. Now I have a farm, a portfolio of offers in every single market. And so I just did this the other day. Are those paying out? Yeah. Yeah. I mean Mark, that's what Mark did. That's how I learned it from him. Like all his offers he Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayor, he brokered the deals. And so you like So let's get let's get raw. Like so you won't say exact numbers, but like you'll have a five, a 10, a whatever just like hit the bank B like from these different ones like month over month. Yeah. Yeah, cuz I mean usually the first month month when you launch um that's the biggest payout comes because we only work with like like this initial off the bat you see these big spikes. We launch with organic people and then once they go right cuz we're not just doing cold right away. So big launch sometimes I just want the money from the launch. I'm like hey I'll take a bag right there. Then it'll go down and then they'll scale back up with that money. And so there's a big spike and then a dip but then it can pick up depending on how the operator is. And so I was going to say that cuz that's the next layer. It's again like I kind of want to go into that like is this depth thing and that's what we talked about. That's what we talked about in that. You didn't let me finish talking about why I don't why like we can talk more about like why I work on multiple. You talk you can talk about the the number one comment on the Eddie one is I talk too much and I said this isn't an interview and so I'm just going to shut up because it's not an interview. No no it's all good. It's good. People like this bro it's more engaging than just like a boring like well it's just like I don't I don't Yeah. We don't need to know. You can go anywhere to find stories and lists and that and whatever. We're just shop. We're just chat. We're just talking just how I talk to you in person, you know. Um, but yeah, who are you as a person? I'm just so you have to think, are you the creative type or you more the operator? Are you more of the entrepreneur or the integrator? It's like the E-Myth book. You can kind of figure out who you are. Um, but I started off as a person who's operator. I just dialed in on one. Like my first deal was with someone in the interior design niche. Um, so not like super random niche, this interior designer lady who had an interior design business. And um, she didn't do like it wasn't like bizop. it was more like helping with the actual design and the creative stuff and whatever. And so that was the first person I locked in with. I only focused on that one deal and I just scaled that up until she wanted to have a baby and wanted to move on something else and then I she had a baby and I jumped on the next one. So ideally all the deal like I tried to be the operator. I was like I'm going to stick in this one thing. But the way I had to like stay focused I had to do consulting calls on the side cuz I was just just itching to do other stuff. So, I had to create a way to be creative. And so, I that's where I did, you know, hundreds of calls on Zoom one-on-one. Uh, anywhere from $500,000, sit on a call with somebody, just build out their offers, their business. And so, I that's what allowed me to stay focused. But I finally was like, you know what? Why fight this? Why not just lean into my full creative side and then become friends with people like, you know, Craig, who's one of the fulfillment partners? I, you know, send him deals. I didn't realize that's how you guys were. Yeah. Our student, he's one of our fulfill So, our students broker deals to Craig. So Craig, I think someone broke a deal with like a million followers the other week. Uh it's a new student. Nobody's didn't have any results yet. Broker's a deal. Now Craig, who's a beast, is going to scale it up and the broker is just going to chill and take his cut. So um anyways, who are you? And then some offers too, like the creator, you don't know the longevity of the creator, like the lady who wanted to have the baby. I couldn't predict that she wanted to like retire from her business and do something else. And I had the ability where I could have taken the offers and the assets and put a new face on it. Actually had their competitor want that, but I was friends with this wife and husband and like they're sending me pictures of them when they have the baby and we're talking about vacation together. It's like dude, I'm not going to like do that to them. So I didn't do that enough. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of messed up. But like a lot of times you don't know longevity. So some offers I'm like okay um I know there's creators and experts willing to sprint for a year or two years I feel like and let's just you know launch um I'll scale as far as they want to and then I'll in back of my mind I'm like how can I put this money into uh something else or other investments like obviously the goal isn't to stay in info forever like you said the goal is to take that money maybe put into real estate or whatever so my mind isn't just like in info like my mentor Mark Lax taught me very well that the point is to build like for people like me build a business KPI it outsource sell it and then dump that money to something else. Like he did that with his info offer. He sold it for 5.2 uh 5.2 million, dumped most of it at Bitcoin at like 9K or 25K and now he's just chilling and now he's publishing deals for fun cuz he's bored and just vibing. And so obviously it's like he still is publishing, but who are you? What's the point of the deal? Like one of my offers, the point of that offer is to buy our house. It's like this offer, it's a lifestyle offer. It's going to pay for our house. Oh man, that is a page out of the book, bro. Literally, I mean Allan is so funny with that. He'll be like, "Oh, like I want to buy this launch an offer." It's so smart. I mean, he even told me he's like, "This is a mind game." In a good way. I mean, good way. Allan, shout out to Allan. He he told me he's like, "Josh, buy buy a house, pay off your debt, then go freick do whatever and go in other markets." Like he's like, you know, do other stuff, use info as cash flow to get other stuff. And so, you in the house? Are you in the house right now? We we could we have the we can get the like the down payment, but the market's like, frick. And also, do I want to take care of house? I want to go to events and travel. I'm like, frick, I'm 23 and my wife and I want to go to Disney all the time and just vibe. Married at 23. I love that. You're all you're ahead of the game in every aspect. Uh, all right. So, let's get tech. Let's get technical. So, or more so scale. Let's take that to the nth degree and understand why. Yeah. Why do you think they pump and then they stop or drip after? And why do you not go the next layer? Because, okay, everything is the funnel, right? Everything is a funnel. Everything has ascension tracks. Everything has deeper LTV depending how you look at it. I use the example all the time that's like the life insurance guys, right? For example, you pick that niche, you sell info, coaching, whatever on the front. That's amazing. You get your 3x rorowaz whatever and you're chilling. But what you really do is then you get them. So like a lot of the examples is they sell it, they teach you how to like, you know, retire taxree or do this or that or whatever. And then where they really make all the money is they teach you about this account you can get and it's life insurance. They get massive commissions and instead of getting a 3:1, they get a 30 to1 and they do it in all these other ways. Okay? I know these other guys that do it with an agency on the back. I know other guys that do two-sided marketplaces that teach info and then they sell the person basically because they're then trained that like in any of these offers that do this. Your next step in my brain and like well I don't understand the is you have it, it's built, the offer is there and then like you said, you pass it off to the po to like a fulfillment partner or whatever. But like that's almost where that growth operator arm comes into it where you can still own because I I seriously I don't understand like I mean I get what you're saying but at some level is like wouldn't you want to pull back instead of trying to do 10 of them do two or three of them or do one of them to start get your creative thing get all your whatever and don't move on to the next one until you implement you install an operator. There are there are there are literally info and coaching companies that teach people how to be operators and then sell them do the two-sided marketplace. You could literally be a partner on the back end of that info like this in thing. But like why would you not do that and then have them chill at a million a month instead of doing a million and then 100k and then 5 50k and then just dance around that and make like a one hundth. Um I mean first thing would be because I didn't know I didn't see what was possible. Like you can only go as far as you can see. Oh for sure. No that's not a that's not a No. Here's the thing. This is this is this Yeah. So people now know like the the benefit of the publishers we teach now and looking at my story is they're seeing like the next level to this. So let me the next offer. So like the main offer the main thing like that legacy offer I call it like my legacy offer that we're scaling. We're we're working on that. My other deals are just funding it. They're cash flowing it. So all these other smaller deals my portfolio anything else I do is funding this other offer. When before I launched this offer, I architected it different than just a domain. Instead of looking at the domain or whatever, I looked at it from an economic or financial model. I said, I want there to be info. I want there to be ecom. I want there to be software. And I want there to be lead genen. So, I want to be a lead genen company for someone else. Those are my four requirements. And then I looked around. I tried to figure out what market, what mechanism, what industry could I do those four things? And we found it. And we have it. And so now I have the person who's the expert building out the product as for one company you want it to do all it's four things. So it in this four four monetization methods for one niche. Yeah. Yeah. So so now our students what we say is here's the thing you can play the launch game or you can play this legacy game and sometimes people need to play the launch game to survive and pay the bills before they can focus on the legacy. So it's like you got to figure out your your situation. Like a lot of people coming into this copywriters freelancers that are kind of barely getting by. can't wait for an offer to scale from zero. And so we've created a path where you can work with someone as an organic audience, get that cash flow, then focus on other stuff. It's like a stepping stone. But for me, the focus now is the legacy offer. And these other deals, they're just funding it. And like I'm brokering deals get me cash flow because then all that those payouts that hit my account, I'm just going to put into this other company I'm bootstrapping. And I'm doing that because this one's going to need more lift and we're not launching to an organic audience. No, that makes sense. So four things you got to before you publish an offer, you want to like think deep. Info, ecom, software, and lead genen. So who could you sell your list of customers to refer people to? So it does it you're selling, you're using all four of those monetization methods. You're going to have a software baked in. You're going to sell products. That's a plan. So you go info to start is low uh low fulfillment costs, right? High profit margins. You do that. Then you add ecom on the back end so that you're not paying cost per acquisition to uh acquire an e-commerce product because you're it's the margins you can you're then selling them physical products. You bring them in info you sell a thousand people you make 90% margin or 99 organic you get the freaking you're selling physical products. What are you sell? And then you're selling them a physical product that's a consumable recurring consumable ideally recurring. Um, there's other ones too in this one. I I don't want to leak like this is but it's like consumable and then there's stuff like household item like a plug and then and then you're trying to plug a software and then software can tie usually can tie into uh info because uh like for you guys like apps, right? If you had an app they're pretty or like Yeah, it's like info through a software. Yeah. And so dude, making software now is so easy with AI. I have a friend who um he he has an offer coming out soon called automatic apps and he's doing it's like bisop but it's definitely the next wave where instead of selling like PDFs all all these stuff it's selling apps and these like GPTs to build apps. So anyways you can make software so easy now. Um and I can actually get people to build them for free for me because some of the names we're publishing are so big where I'm like hey you want to say you built an app for so and so but anyways um so then you do that and then lead genen. So then my customers, I'm like, who has a service that I not going to compete with that can sell it to? So for us, it'd be a home service industry. So there's a home service niche, high ticket where these people pay for leads. And so our goal, that's where the real big money is going to be. Um, we can either sell the leads or I mean, where you make more money is if I can get a cut of every deal they close from the leads I send. Exactly. Do a partnership deal because I have exclusive providers nationwide. And it's like, you know, Dave Ramsey um does this super well. Like he has Oh, yeah. like real estate bro like, "Hey, our trusted realtors, our trusted financial advisors." And he's playing both ends. That's what I'm saying. So, okay. So, you're going deep on this one. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You have to. This is the I'm buying the house with one of the offers. The other offers fund the freaking other this deal. This deal is one that that's the big boy game or the bigger and then that's where you mature. That's where you get all the money, bro. Yeah, I'm trying to be the best student as possible and like I can only go out to here, but like you can go hundreds of millions with that alone. Like that's what's here's the thing. I think the hardest lesson I'm going have to learn like this is going to be the hardest thing I ever do because I'm going to have to be okay with being bored and I have to be disciplined and like waiting for the long-term payout because I'm not going to be able to jump around. But the thing that keeps me excited is I know okay if we get the info to this then I can do the ecom and then we seal the ecom and it's like milestones. Yeah. It's creative inside it. So have to be across before I thought it was boring like oh frick I only can do this but I have to stay and what's nice is uh on this deal to give me built-in accountability I gave one of my publisher friends 10% to be like our CMO and consultant because he's stayed in an offer and scaled it to over 50k a day. no high ticket, strictly low ticket. Um, guy, yeah, Doug, I've interviewed on my channel. I can't say his last name. Um, and he stuck with one lady who was like a nobody. And so he he told me he's like, Josh, he's the one kind. He's like, you have to like, let's lock in. He's like, you want built one, if you want you want built accountability. Okay. Obviously, I'm like, dude, come on this offer. Because he's got so much experience. And so I got you can still be creative. You can still go off, you can bop around, you can scratch the edge. Like I call it like interest mapping or doing whatever. Like I'll go start a drop shipping store and run it and do 100 grand in a month and just like cuz I want to on a weekend. Like I do that stuff and like I broke even on that by the way. I did not make money. But like I just was like curious. I hadn't run ads in a long time. I hadn't built Shopify in a long time. I didn't know what themes were cool and like I just wanted to do it and like Can you say what product it was? What can I say? Yeah. What did you say? It was in the dog niche. It popped. It was dope. I just couldn't and I like didn't want to make I didn't want to make like I just didn't want to do the whole gambit. I didn't want to do advertorials and whatever. Mark would crush me in the chat if he heard that. But I just was like I was about 40% of the way bought in and I was doing that and I was like yeah it's just but okay so six six multi6fig and seven figure guys where you actually get value and like talk the economics of this. talk the low low ticket the acquisition the two different talk ascension versus talk liquidation because so I I talked to and let me just preface this I talked to two guys both that are let's call it two three million a month um in info and coaching one is high ticket like way not way high but like 25k call it and then another one is in the 10ishk range both bids high both of them uh both of them were not running low ticket at all. Both were doing BSL call funnels direct and one was doing like DTAish and then uh I was talking to one it was like right in the beginning of this like one of my first couple videos and he starts hitting me up on Instagram. Super cool guy, tons of similarities, all this stuff and he's like, "Oh, I'm about to test this webinar direct to cart thing." And we're talking about, you know, that one company we talked about that does that and then does it to a set and then a close and like does that model where it's direct to cart fixed auto and then they do the ascension, right, for like four times the price on high ticket. So he launched that and he is the other one I'm talking to right now is about to launch the low ticket and is like oh we're just going to do it because it definitely can work for mass market. The question is does something for 37 197 whatever what is the e what are your economics and what is your market match when you're trying to sell something for 25k or whatever because like you do this all the time and like we didn't even touch on that. Yeah. Yeah. So I think I understand your question. We're go with it. Um, are you like you're talking front-end price point? Like what I'm talking about like what are the economics and like what are examples? Yeah. Don't say names because I don't want to be those guys, but like like what have you seen or like what is the scale? Cuz like I kind of talk about ours and ours is whatever. We're in the sub 100 low ticket game for ascension focused. We do nothing around upsells, downells, anything to on purpose because we're trying to push to the call and focus on ascension and it's mapping very well. The biggest thing for us is making sure the net the net CPA stays down and that we can do enough volume to where ascension rate is let's say three or f whatever number you have to sell think about that you have to sell you know 100 a day on average to get five to pop out and when you're trying to do 50 on the back end it's like that math does math unless you have to do so much volume for it to back out. So what do you see? I mean you've done tons of these. You've done ascension ones. You've done fully liquidation. You've done so like what pops cuz talking to the six seven figure guys a month that don't have one of these. Yeah. So I think especi Okay. So let's talk about the book a call funnel right now. Um the best thing like if you're going to go strictly you're doing VSSL and you want to go to low ticket. The thing that has popped and continued to pop is pretty similar to the model you guys are doing where we will have uh front-end $27 product and then we will have two order bumps to try to get our AOV to 50 as close as possible and then we'll go right to book call radios like you're going to do like one option or the other or the other one's a bundle or what? No, they're two different products. So there's three products total in this funnel. Yeah. How do you anchor them? The pricing pricing I mean for the bumps. Yeah. So like one your core is 27. How do you The other ones were the other uh price points we did were usually $17 and $22. Um sometimes we've done higher and those can get a take rate of anywhere from 50 to 55%. Um what was the AOV on it? I can just see here I have a calculator. Yeah. What was the AOV on it? Is um 35. 40 bucks. That'd be crazy. I got a This one was in You can just riff. It's fine. Yeah. No, I I have my I have this financial plan I can share. I don't know if you guys want this, I can share at the end by I saw it. I saw your I literally was on your Facebook today and saw it. Yeah, I have this whole like tracker where I can like play the numbers and map out. What is it? What is it? Just give me rough numbers. So, it was 22 and then it was 22. So, like 5% taker on the front end. You'd be closer to like a 40 40 to 45 AOV just on like the $27 front end. $17 order bump one $22 order bump uh number two. And those all those are both around 50% take rates which is very easy to do like getting a take like order bumps are so easy to sell bro don't overthink them just slap in there pre-check bump uh you could do uncheck you could do pre-check yeah on go high level I think you can do that savage you just do pre-check uncheck it if you don't want it the refunds people see it they know you have to see you're not like doing anything gray hat like before they see the complete order it's checked um none of my funnels have pre-checked bumps just to be there. I just know people who do it. And for all the dark lords out here like that kind of stuff, there you go. Mine do not cuz I'm in ClickFunnels and you can't do it. So, exactly. I was like, um, so yeah, $27 front end 1722 $40ish AOV. Um, and then right to book a call. And so, usually, you know, you can and then right to book a call. That's your That's your dude. And guess what? You got someone who's even easier if you got a high a VSSL that's already cranking. I'm gonna take this what I did. All I did this for career consulting in the data like job placement industry. We took the freaking and I did this for uh accountants too. So two different industries just to give context. I took their VSSL I transcribed in dscript. I took that over to freaking AI and was like study this whatever. I said like remember this back when there's projects. Then I took my little low ticket funnel template for copy and I like came up with a product idea like ah we're going to call like the something master class because my thing I sell master classes on the front end which is like a webinar pretty much and I just made the funnel like I just took their existing all their stuff that's already hitting all their hooks is already in that VSSL they've already proven out and then we had the low ticket ready to go. So all you guys who have VSSL funnels don't overthink the messaging like don't seems you produce an actual low ticket product from it. No, I had the I just told the person to make a master class. I'm saying all the copy the angles were all validated because it's coming from their existing VSSL. Yeah. Anuk was talking about it at the event and he was saying how they'll bolt like similar to that. So they'll run like a low ticket funnel and then on the like post it's like oh you qualified for this bonus, you got this free master class and then just dropping them in the webinar or the whatever. Yeah. That's interesting on the email. I usually did a little later if you're doing book a call like with what he's doing. I think is he pitches a book a call at the end. No, he does mid ticket at the end of the webinar. But if you're doing high ticket um and you don't have a mid ticket, then I would just do book a call. Try to push for that on an upsell page and the thank you page in case like, hey, you didn't get to book your call, do it again. And then you run the 1 hour fast start, which we talked about in the last podcast we did. Um and I can share swipes on how I position that. I can send you the emails like how do you position a 1hour fast start ascension webinar to your list? Um, and that's you just just for context, that's you sending an email at post-purchase of a low ticket where you're pushing them to an automated webinar. Automated and then obviously automated webinar generally speaking, what you just said is CTAing to a book a call for high ticket generally or software. Yeah, I mean I've done both. Or software. Yeah, dude. We've never done mid I mean that's not true. Not never, but we've never I say it again. We've we have never done it truly. Uh we've never done any webinars. We've never done any mid ticket. For me, it just does like doesn't We did a mid ticket over the phone. It was like 1,000 bucks, 1,500 bucks. But it uh it's so hard to segment out the offer other than the whole like especially in our like in some of these niches, it's hard to do like done for you, done with you, done do it yourself for your industry. Well, it's just harder, right? Because it's like you give away everything, which is fine. And then like the other one is accountability and that stuff's a that's a done for you. So it's like that's why it's not done, you know, like the highest you can go is done with you. You can't ever get done. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can in your industry. You're thinking for Here's the thing. You know what's so stupid? Here, I'm going to you let's argue on Twitter on this. All right. Done with you and done for you are the same thing. I'm sick and tired of here. You know what I'm saying? Here's the thing. We're saying the same thing. Yes. You know, but let's just change for the audience. You guys are out here. Oh, how do I done for you? He's like, bro, shut the freak up. You're done with you is literally done for you. You know why people are paying you? Oh. Oh, here we go. We're going to talk about the difference. I'm going to tell you how to freaking sell the crap out of done with you offers like you're done. All right. So, they're the same thing. When someone pays for a done with you offer, what are they paying for? Well, they're paying for you to make decisions for them. All right? They want to save time and energy, right? For thinking. That's why I was sold hundreds of consulting calls because all these people wanted me to think for them. I wasn't building their funnel. I wasn't writing their copy, but I was thinking for them. Now, we have chatbt that can do a lot of thinking for us. So that's going to eliminate a lot of things. But so funny. This is a done with you offer. You can you can easily curate GPTs to have good stuff. So you can do that. But here's the thing. Whenever I think the biggest mistake people do with their backend done with you stuff is they sell it like it's done with you. They're like, "Oh, you get these coaching calls and you get 50 calls a week and then there's support blah blah blah." No. Your bullet should be listing out all the things and all the areas where you're going to be thinking for them. So one of the ways we make it so good is they hate reverse. Boom. I'm thinking for you here. We're going to do this for here. And then the way you do it is on calls. But so many times people butcher and they're like I'm like well I will say I will say there is the mechanism is sometimes relevant in how you can sell it because if you are selling it in a in a group setting versus a onetoone setting there is a large value difference. And then to go even further the who the onetoone is with is different. So imagine I I I explained this in some kid's tweet that did not ask for my opinion. Um but he was like talking about like tweets you reply to probably. Yes. I just got to chill. I gota I got to get off all this [ __ ] Yeah, bro. Got it's like you just found the internet for the first time. Like my replies from having so much dude I sat a cave for like 10 years. Leave me alone. Um but I literally responded. It was like how do you guys all have time to do that? Like I can make a couple hundred grand doing uh onetoone coaching or group or whatever doing coaching. Why don't I do it? or like how do you guys have time for it or something. And I was like, "Yeah, the value ladder is like essentially onetoone coaching with you." Yep. Group coaching with you, onetoone coaching with a coach, group coaching with a coach. And like, dude, you're talking like 1K, 5K, 10K, 40K dep, you know, whatever the math. And that's real. Like if someone, you know what I mean, like people are, you know, ask you, I'm sure, or whatever, or like me or these other people like, "Oh, let's do consulting." Think about the time like the difference in that. Oh, for sure. So big. And so is it for the person if they're going to sign up. So that's where I think the mechanism is important when you're saying done with you or done for you. And I also think it's very important to talk about which one it is unless you can sell it without because if you can sell it at the same price as what one onetoone with you is and have the same service delivery but the cost of a group doing it because like the model there is like one to one is all your time. One to group is your time with many, right? So like you get leverage. The next layer introduces real cost not time cost. So now it's like dollars because you're paying a team or breaking them off somehow. And then it's like onetoone with them is 20% of the service. Call it is like industry standard but can be less depending on how high ticket your thing is. And the next one is like like 5%. Or less 2%. It's like you start to get into like info margins with coaching because you have one coach for 30 in a cohort or whatever and they're all paying three grand or whatever the number is and like it it works out to you know a coach still making 70 90 whatever the math is. Like you can math it well. Yeah. Yeah. But and I mean that's what's beautiful is I mean on our freaking upsell book a call scripts we leave it pretty open. Like we just sell the outcomes of what we're thinking for them and then on the call it dictates where we put them call the sales call like it's up to the application cuz and you just anchor down group and one. Yeah. Because I mean ideally I mean I'm trying to get somebody like to my highest paid thing where I can make the most amount of money but not everyone can afford that. So I have other options where it's the like the group or with a coach or do you sell onetoone with you? I have that. I mean not as I did before like I was just doing Google doc and a calendar link and yeah and you just do you just walk through like it's just you for sitting there bro just sitting there one hour what do you want me to build and I tell you what here's your front end here's your order bump two. Boom. Boom. Done. Leave. Um, dude, I was doing like five something six calls a day. Six new businesses. I come upstairs, my wife can just tell. I'm just like dead. I'm like, you're upsell front end. It was so many. And making a couple like couple G's a day just like popping these off for fun. And like that's I said I had to scratch the itch, bro. And I think, dude, it's so tempting to go back to it because it's like it's such fun money, but again, like you said, you got to go deep in other things. I I close it down for now. But I mean people still they come they're like I'm like you keep raising your price. I don't know. I mean someone like you who has that like creative and can like in that way. I think it's cool. I have a business coach that I hired that it like does a ton of lead genen guys and it's like a whale in this thing and uh I meet with him. I did every other week. So I do I had it today but we were going through the stats of like I like come you know fully loaded to talk about all this stuff and I'm basically like he's like you know wins and I'm like boom boom boom boom boom like I just how I work. And I was like all this inflow though in my inbox like everyone's asking for consulting everyone's asking for this or that and I'm like what you know so we literally talked out exactly what we're saying like what are the monetization methods possible what is the and I just kept saying I was like I just want to build the moat deep I just want to keep going moat I don't want to like think about that I don't want to have my time there I don't want to do anything and the second I accept a dollar from somebody I am like oh my god like this is how I I'm going to do everything in my power I don't have the like oh do I mean like and it's not speaking bad on it but like if someone was like oh I want to pay for an hour for 10G or whatever the number is like and I sat there and I would do 10 hours I would do 500 never stop because I would be like until I know that someone made like true 100 grand in 10 like this it's just how I I don't know it's just I never done it probably like a limiting belief but I just don't and he was like what are the other monetization methods he was like is it partnership is it equity deals is it whatever I'm like yeah I mean the big play is like some hormosi level thing but he deploys teams so then you have leverage issues because it's not just your time. Iman told me about the guy that has uh he makes, you know, over eight figures a year doing getting equity as his monetization method and his fulfillment is group coaching with companies that he has equity in. Imagine that you have like two time slots a week Tuesday and Thursday for two hours and you're and you're equity owner, you know, I mean like companies does like crazy, dude. It's pretty much up here again. These guys have like teams they deploy and do all this stuff, but like you talk about leverage on leverage sometimes. Not really. They just say that to look cool, but most times you're just group coaching them. Like it's just a whole new like cuz we have in our program Yeah. We have we have people in our program who like sold their companies to people like Hermosy and it's so I was like oh that's all that's it you little group co. I'm like sick dude. So that's why like for me when I broker deals now like I'll say like I'll jump on a call with a company maybe every other week for 30 minutes an hour and I'll just say blah blah fix this blah and I'll leave. I'll be like a CMO kind of give some strategic stuff and make sure everything's good. But yeah, it's it's there's definitely a play there. So, um yeah, that's another sick model and that's a very cool model because that's where it's like you just keep going down this, you know, the depth thing I I talk about. It's like how do you go within this scope versus No, bro. That's one of the things like especially when I was doing the consulting stuff I my how far I could see I mean it was strategic for a play to publishing and getting deals like it was the lead genen for getting into companies and getting into offers and I have this whole intention with it but I know like going deeper with it there's so many ways it could have and still dude I seriously think and and you already said you actually said this to me and then I just validate I agreed with what you said so this is not my idea but you were like oh I need like a you know an operator partner I need something like that because if you could have you You almost have to leave them behind though if you're going to do it right. It's like you need a you need a pool of them because you need to go like deploy be side by side have this person like run it and then you go do the next one and then cuz they you know that person can't jump with you unless they're No, you have to you have to have a they replace themselves and like that's true. You see a lot of those guys where it's like two guys um I'm trying to remember who but there's this other guy that does like a private equity style play like holding co play and his partner is a very technical like integratory style guy but he's at such a high level that he can like go in understand it set up whatever and replace himself and then travel with you guys are both going offer to offer and he's replacing that's the dream I'm still looking for that dude that's but like I don't even think I need that dude with this next that gives me like anxiety like I have nowhere close to that you know what I mean like thinking of like leaving that behind new your email address, your Slack, your whatever, and it's like move to the next one. It's like, bro, I wouldn't do that with info, like online. I would do that like my buddy, he does that with home service businesses. Yeah. And he's a marketer. And so he like gutter business. He went so deep with that automate. And he comes to me, he's like, "All right, I'm done with that business is moving." He does his wife business and he's like, "What do I do now?" And I'm like, "I don't like the model." But it's like, it's not info. It's offers that you don't want to do it with. It's not that you don't want to do it with info. Oh, there are plenty of infoation or whatever businesses that have a lot of legs long but it's like the dynamic like I would if I'm going to do it like that I want a business that's more static I guess I'd say where I can it's very operator can keep doing the same thing over and over versus like info like yes they have a lot of legs but you're revising the angles and the scripts and the positioning it's like that's fine but you have to have a really creative operator inside somebody's doing that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like you got to have you have a home services business and you've got freaking payroll and trucks breaking down and this and that. I mean, I get it. Everything has everything, dude. There's always problems on both sides. It's what are you willing to problem? So, if you have to have a you have to have a fractional CMO that goes across all your companies and has to do new angles. I think it's a little maybe a little better than your mass inventory. But here's the thing. I mean, with AI, I guess I guess with AI, you can the creative thinking is going to be replaced very fast. So, I guess there's ways you could do that, too. How are you using that? I don't use it at all. That's not I don't I don't use it at the like I got so whenever I see all these guys talk about it and like I use it for these guys here. Let me tell I see behind these things. All right, let me tell you something. What? just you know the guys on X talking about AI and they're talking about oh how deep and oh look at my they send you a screenshot their n and this system does this and it does this and that they aren't even using them like okay if they have a really crazy one they don't have a business that they're normally really using in right now I mean dude it's a best engagement bro it's just because and then guess what you look at you're like oh my gosh I'm so far behind in AI I need to pay them they know how to do all this with AI I got to pay them it's just the same as prompts. My buddy ran the biggest AI prompt offer back in the day and he had a whole notion thing of prompts. Everyone's like, "He's so far ahead." And then we're like, "Wait, you can just have AI make those prompts." You realize the moat's not that big. And so like most of these guys like, so don't I think the biggest thing I tell people is you don't if you start getting a place like I'm too I'm far behind. Look at all these guys. Like nah, you're not that they're not even that far ahead of you. Well, I think the biggest thing for me is and you can use it in simple ways. Yeah. I had two three calls today. I did like I still do like the vendor research side of our tech for uh so like I I just like to pick that still and it's I probably should get out of it but like I like to know it's like come to it with it's like it's a little bit higher level right and uh I'm essentially trying to solve for source of truth with all of our data and then a AI roll out of basically uh replace and enhance all of our automations first because we have whatever three millions apps and then the next layer is to replace and enhance roles and like responsibilities and stuff, right? start with all the tech and start by doing that and then do it on roles and like efficiencies and systems and the general like consensus of today was my understanding of what AI can do that automation can't is very limited like I can't right like I understand that it can do that and it can do it like a little better or whatever it can have like and how somebody explained it to me was essentially like you have triggers then you have actions and automations more or less right obvious but with AI you have triggers infer is what they kept saying. It infers and then it has actions. So, it's basically like it can do like its own contextual things. And again, like that makes sense when you hear it like that, but like how do you put that into practice? I still I'm that's where I mean I'm uneducated. I don't necessarily need to know how to like click the button and run it. I need to know it's possible so I can then do it because that's where I'm trying to reach is like the point of leverage now where I can like have these conversations and we're like, "Oh, that sounds amazing." and then someone goes and builds it and because like I'm trying to reduce the right now like production ends at the end of my fingertips and like I want it to end like through other people and like through team that's trying to like stack the scale and I'm not there yet in close but like I think I mean one I because I dream up ideas like that where it's like man if what if AI could do this or whatever and then I just go to chatbt and I ask it what tools could do it and I just like come up with it and I find a lot of like stuff that way so there's always a tool for it I'm like oh wait I could build this and it used to be seem super hard and now I just ask chatbt tell me the exact stack I need or AI stack to build a thing that does this and then I say step by step how do I set it up step by step yeah what is the walk through literally bro and I'm like boom we're like coded like we're coding a job board right now for our like talk about going deep with offer publisher um that's a whole another we had a whole another side so like we're doing stuff like that I'm like I don't want to I was like can AI can you make this and it's like oh use lovable and then do this and then use this for the datab Easy. I'm I don't I'm not a tech person. That's why I do like X though. I mean, you're right. Like, there's obviously the farms or the crypto farm guys who like, oh, you know, Chad GBT taught me how to make a trading bot that did this and like they just do it for followers and all that stuff. Now they do it with NAN, now they do it with whatever. There is one there's a couple like I follow some of the uh what's his name? Like the EP guy like he's a G. Yeah, he's a G. Yeah, I mean there's like those guys. So, it's like you got just like anything, you know, there's people I asked that N question. It's the my number one. It got like I don't even know 300,000 or something like impressions. And he hit me up like instantly. thing. He's like, "What are you trying to build?" And I was like, "My guy, thank you." And we went back and forth and he was like, "Yeah, don't buy my stuff cuz if you want it." Mine is like his was more on like true prompting and like whatever. All this stuff in this direction and mine was more about automations, enhancement stuff. And he was like, "Go this direction." Gave me three people. Like that's the kind of like not even try. I mean, again, he's only going to make whatever he's going to make. If I was to buy his thing and like instantly points me in the other direction. I'm like, that's another legit. That's a real Yeah. So that's legit. Yeah. What's uh Let me go through these comments on this. So, the what do you what do you think most people get dead wrong about launching a low ticket offer? Oh, frick. There's so many. Um I already have like three in my brain. Okay. You sell obviously the biggest one is you're selling a product on the front and that attracts the wrong person on the back end. Example, super easy. But it's like that's so real, right? Because Okay, I made this mistake. Let me give you a story. one of my one of my offers um that I published the second offer I ever published. So like meaning I'm a publisher get a cut expert second one so I'm you know I'm still newish I was really thinking about this but his backend offer was coaching group coaching style thing and so it's coaching information whatever on the front end I decide to sell a tool a process plug-andplay that's it and then we somehow are trying to make the connection on the back end where it's like oh if the process breaks then we're here to coach for you and it's like what the freak we're literally devaluating like what they just bought. Yeah. And you did the done for you upfront for $12. Yeah. What the freak? And so you sell the wrong thing or you sell tools like if you sell tools on the front end that's funny. Yeah. So you do that that's wrong. Um an explainer behind that. That's because you flip the model, right? And yeah, flipped it backwards. It should have been selling a model on the front end, tools to do the model faster, and then the coaching helps you faster. Yeah. So here's how I fixed it, though. I just sold even more done for you stuff on the back end. So tool, you can sell tools on the front end, but your upsells have to be more tools or done for you setting up that tool. It's additional tools. So that's a big uh I like Allen's explainer of that, which is like you're basically just selling the same exact information, right? Is like the easy way to say it. Yeah, you can do that information and it's up. Yeah. Well, no, like no, just like the different layers of implementation and the easy way to say it. Yep. Yep. And so like that's the biggest one I see people do. Um oh low ticket thinking that I mean today's world I made I made a post on this but people who complain when it's not liquidating on the front end and they're like oh it just broke what's up. What do you target? Sorry your video's it might be mine but your video. What do you What do you target on the on liquidation on the front end? I mean the biggest like our biggest ones they're at like 3 point4. your biggest ones in what were your biggest at scale profitable like like money being made profit on the back end because to at scale it's like you can deep try to make your front end convert right and write really good ads and you're trying to squeeze these little percentage increases to get a few more dollars on the front end when you should spend all like majority of your time on the back end right making the profit up on a high ticket other offers recurring mid ticket whatever like the big that's I made a post on this and I consult a lot of offers So, you know, some of these aren't ones that I'm running actively, but you know, they're doing they're like they're happy when they have like a.3 and as long as they're getting 100, you know, 150 200 on the front end because they're like, "We don't give a crap. We're going to sell all this in the back." What I will say is very interesting. We I I had Eddie on before the uh as my last one and talking to him and he in the thing was in the video was talking about how low ticket is the like model that they are least experienced in and they're like big boys, right? Like, you know, everyone's like, "Oh, whatever." They don't do Okay, they do 1.5 billion in client and generated revenue. They do whales that he won't even say their name like at dinner because they're so big. So, everyone can offer their Oh, he does, you know. Yeah, he does over 10 a week in client generated. Okay. So, um Yeah, I was going to say something jokingly mean, but I'll hold it back. Yeah, exactly. We're all just being nice here. And, uh it's like he was talking about how a majority of what they do are DTA style and that they're trying to get into it. We were talking about our low ticket after actually and we've never we've never done it up until recently and for us it's exact model what you're saying. I literally I still to this moment I said this to you the other day. I couldn't tell you right now what my liquidation percentage is. I could tell you my net CPA like that. But I couldn't tell you like what percentage it is because I don't know that like off the top and like my math but it doesn't matter because if I know my net CPA and I know my ascension rate like literally to the 0.00% I can tell you it right now for last month. I can tell you for last quarter. I can tell you it for last month isolated to last month and back end. I can tell you last month isolated to overall. I can tell you all of them. And like that's the those are the two numbers that matter, right? Because if you have a $100 net CPA and you have a $100 net CPA and a 5% uh ascension, you have a $2,000 CPA, your backend product net. Yeah. And if you're selling a $10,000 thing now, it's just about volume. Yep. And like but the issue is a lot of the time the volume and what are the other issues when you sell the wrong thing and it doesn't get the 5% ascension. If you sell the to the wrong person who is not the person who's going to send to the back end. What else? Um and then I would say I mean those are two big ones. And then I think too many upsells they kill the high ticket sales process. Uh if you're doing high ticket on the back end um that's oh frick here's another one. big one. Front-end product. Um, this is a big one. You people just throw random stuff together and they don't realize that their front-end product is probably one of the biggest me like mechanisms in the ascension process like to get people ascending. Um, how so? Some people focus too much on teaching stepby-step stuff or super educational like long courses or even like books when I found it was better to yes give them fast things to implement if we're teaching a model but increasing belief through the product and so uh obviously I mean low ticket I think the consumption rate is pretty low. I think 10% of the people will actually complete or consumer load to get offer is what we've seen. It depends on what it is. If it's a tool, it can be higher. So, you're not not a ton of people, but those 10% are great on a phone process. And so, I think a lot of times people throw ramps together. They uh they like miss that real estate there of attention because you know how important consumption is, right? And how it's so hard to get people to consume. That's I think our number one thing I would I would argue that that probably is our like like why it's helping our like moat almost. Yeah, bro. I see your emails and it's like more videos and you got your website. I'm like frick like all it is and none of it is cold. None of it which is dumb also by the way. Like we still have not put enough focus, energy, whatever to master using that content for cold acquisition or for like first click and like us on the back end. But it's huge in because I look at I even look at your stuff. I'm like, "Hm, no." Okay. No crazy claims now. I'm like, "What?" But I'm like, "Fick, there's so many like videos and blogs and Yeah. It's like we're direct response, but not right." Yeah. You don't don't look like it. You don't look I've seen direct. It's like, dude, and like I So funny. We're talking about doing a more cold focused low ticket and it's like, "Oh, let's use this time frame and this, this, this." And it's like, okay, the only way you're using a time frame is if you're talking about like you're not talking about you're not getting a result in a time frame. Like no way. you'll finish this course in seven days. I don't know what you'll get. Seriously, like no joke. I literally was like, "Yeah, you can have it implemented in a week. You can do this." And like we actually found one and I think we're going to go that way and I'll send it over once we frame. There's a but it's not a result at all at all because I'm like we're not doing that. The entire like one whole portion of this I think honestly for every thing I do into the future and this is a bold claim so like maybe not but whoa I I think that I think it gets better customers. I think it gets higher value. Like I think it all the things that you want out of a customer. Y it's harder to sell, but if you have the results, you have like the conviction, you have all these different things that you can still get people into your thing, they are just so much better if you're not quick fixing them and like finance selling that and like doing all these things and you know there's time and place for finance for agreed but the you know there's just so many reasons I think that is a better customer. Y and all our entire thing is like that's why we don't crack on New Year's and like we should. There's still a way to do it in a good way. That's not like new year, new me, complete brand new cuz like we don't subscribe to that. Yeah. Subscribe. Subscribe. We don't do either. I you know what I mean? Like we just don't. Yeah. You don't. And you can Here's the thing. It's so funny because just today I was thinking about this. I walked into the basement of our apartment. I see this guy I know who's our neighbor and he's like, "Oh, what's up?" He's like, "What do you do for work?" And I'm like, I always tell people I run a a marketing agency cuz that's the easiest thing to explain, right? Same. He's like, "Do you sell those like PDFs, those like faceless PDF stuff where it's like make money passive income crap?" And I'm like, "No, bro. I know Ch." He's like, "Yeah, I don't trust that." Like he's going off and I'm like, "Okay, there's a huge segment of every market where the claims do not resonate with them." Like he will never purchase anything with a claim. And all a lot of marketers think that's the only way because yes, there is a market that will respond to it. No, you can one of the most underserved. I think this is there's there's actually real we got we got three underserved markets big. All right. Number one is just markets that don't respond to claims because we've been serving claims forever. There's a whole segment you think about, you know, only 20% of the people on the sales call close and I get 5% conversion rate my low ticket front end product. like a majority of those people who are aren't converting might be in the market like if it's a claim offer then they're not responding to that so we're missing out on them so someone else can go capitalize on it like you guys are the other underserved one is female market and especially in things that relate to bisop of course one of the biggest really underserved but other segments do what's up you know our friends that do that which one female bizop is the closer one no oh female bizop no we'll talk about there's a few I mean there's like no doxing no doxing but Dock. I'll do stuff. All right. We've got No, we know I know two different ones. I know one that does a physical product and one that does a I'm going to get I'm going to I'm going to get interrupt. I'm going to get yelled at for interrupting you, but this is No, I like it. There are two that I know that took exact models. They literally imagine buying like a whatever MMO course and then literally just layering it with like female language in that way. They did that and they crush an MMO. And then we know another group of guys that are doing it with a physical product that did the same thing and branded all female and specific to them and like in all fairness like it does have results that are specific in different ways for like call it hormonal call it this whatever and both of them print and I mean we do it but ours is within but yeah yeah I mean and I think your market is pretty served um but yeah so there's that and then obviously there's different languages I made a post about this too um which we can talk about like how to license your offer um but Yeah, I think that's a big thing. That's why claims you don't need them to to survive. And then yeah, the female market, bro, that's why I'm telling publishers like, oh, for everyone in the comments, how do I find my expert? Go to someone who has a strictly male-dominated product. Say, hey, I'm going to add an additional whatever you're making a month right now. You know, obviously that's a claim. Don't say that, but I could potentially make you more money with your same product, right? I'll get you more customers. Same product. You don't have to record anyone because I'm gonna bring a spokesperson in. So, uh, we have a student. I'm actually against that model. Let's make it clear for everybody. I'm against that model because Which model? That I don't like the idea. I think of bring it to the female market. Yeah. Why? Like you really I like I like the idea uh for that. It's like same reason that I'm not I'm saying that we weren't like it's the depth game. It's like how dude you can take. Isn't that going deeper? like same product, broadening the market, but you're noting it because you're niching it. You're just double niching. But if you're if you're But if your first product is never going to get that market, you're not going deep there then. But the question is, can you So like use us as an example. It's like where I was coming from was use us as an example. Someone came to us and was like, "Oh yeah, and you guys could be doing, you know, another half a million or a million bucks a month like doing it for men." And it's like it's like oh yeah let me just change everything about the entire or like you're basically yeah let me just dupe everything for what for another million bucks a month. You think I couldn't push this another million a month? All right the TAM again and I understand the TAM champion like we're TAM male and female bro like you're there is a large TAM within that. So that's where I say that but I agree with you if you were to spin something up that is like that which both these guys did. Yeah, it's crushes. Someone was talking about it at uh uh in Vegas. They were like, "Make these for women." Yeah. What the f I mean here, think about Make these women specific like Exactly. Remember the torches of freedom campaign? The what? Torches of freedom. Torches. Torches of freedom. The the like a torch torch, but it was about cigarettes. So, let me tell you, let's tell a little story time. Little story time with Josh. Little OG marketing. All right. Little Oglev Oglev Josh. Oglev Josh coming in. So, there was this man. Let me look up his name here because he's got a he's got a name that I'm like I don't even know how to say it. But there's a man who was hired by the government to get America. This is so fun. My shout out my like it's 7 p.m. Normally I'm done working at 5. My wife is recording music. So I'm I'm just get to geek out. This is she's come home and be like what? See the mic on the counter. She's like who are you talking to? Nothing is different in my life. I swear he's a boy. Um okay. So there's a man who did and he was hired by the government, okay, to make America to get Americans bought in on the idea of World War I to in wars like get us sold like American people bought in. We need to go to war even if we don't really need to, right? Cuz they wanted to recruit people. He was the first person to get into psychoanalysis of people and essentially figure out how to hijack people's desires to make them want things that they don't need. This is be the original direct response marketing and there's this group of people where really they thought like every human has these core desires and you can tap into them to make them buy stuff they don't need and you can get them to want it. So desire aka make them lack it. And so these OG the first person ever before this consumers in America we only bought things that we needed. You you didn't buy extra stuff. Your house was not overcluttered. It was just you got what you needed. You go to the store you need something. You didn't ever leave with extra stuff. That wasn't a thing. But what happened is after the war, we had all these factories. We had all this distribution and people they're like, "Fick, we all these supplies, no war going on anymore. We need to sell this stuff." And so they got one of them was cigarettes. Like cigarettes was a big thing. And they were like unable to push it further cuz only, you know, they were only selling to men. And so this guy comes along and he was like, "Look at you connecting." He's like, "Here we go. Here we go. Let's do a campaign called Torches of Freedom." uh Edward uh Bern Bernese. Yeah, Edward Bernese uh he came up with this campaign and he had there's a parade going on in New York or something. I might be it might not be New York. It was a big city and he hired a bunch of socialites from the city to walk hijack the parade with cigarettes and smoke them and he got reporters and camerafield to take it and so they had this whole publicity stunt and on the ads they called it torches of freedom like women are independent we don't like we can smoke as a sign of freedom and oh women are strong we don't need to do men said right they tapped into this desire this lack and got all these women to buy it and cigarette companies boom exploded sales tapping into female market and so um some products will never hit with males but you can tap into it by a whole different language if you men aren't going to be like yeah torches of freedom like I think I mean I think it's a great like you said at your level you aren't going to do that but for some freelance copyriters watching this right now who's like I want to get in the offer game but I don't know what to sell I don't think freelance copyriters watch this they might get you you're on it n I hate to break it to you man shout out if you're a freelance copyrighter agency owner. You're watching this. I know you are. You freaking swipers trying to get all the campaigns going to hijack. They're trying to dox us, bro. They're going to copy our campaigns. Um, but this is like one of the things they do. And so you can you can go to someone like I don't know to sell. Okay. Go to someone who's already selling something. And then uh one of our publishers, he's uh speaks English and Spanish and he lives in the States. Oh, that's a major play too. And he he did the same thing. He did the same thing. Now, other ones, Germany, uh, France, and then Australia. Dude, Australia is so far behind us. The amount of offers I'm on where it's the most b like would not work in our market because it's just saturated that are crushing in Australia and the CPMs and the CPA is low. Yeah. Yeah. I had a uh female influencer reach out that that is selling like a physical product and info products and has a massive following and she they're doing like super small numbers and it's like sending me some of the stats and I'm like god this is just untapped and it's that Australian whatever and she's like oh yeah I don't pitch it I just have link in bio and I was like you do no CTAs she's like no I do no CTA she has like long form YouTube she has like all the stuff and I was like dude people want to buy stuff from you you know like sorry little side tangent But like people like it's it's interesting. Um but yeah, I know a lot of people interesting. You don't have to make claims and trick people and use grey hat. No, and it's not even that. Like it's literally she has a like legitimate like they made their own physical product that's like this crazy high quality. It's like this beautiful Shopify page. It's not CRO. Like there's no conversion. But cheeks. Yeah. But yeah, but like the actual like product itself looks very high quality. And I'm like you could be slanging six figures of this a month and it's like low five figures. And I'm like what's going on? Like, so I'm going to pop on a call and like help with that. That's what I've been doing. I've just been like popping on calls and like having people send me looms and Google Docs and just respond to it. Like seriously, like I'm going to publish you. Hey, how about No, let me just This is like Let me get this to like a couple hundred first. I'm going to get to No, I'm going to publish Blake next. I'm working on him. I got to send the contract. Stop. I need No, he's going to come on here, too. He asked me if he'd come on here. I'm like, "Of course you can, but like just don't go." I actually almost texted him to interview. I was like, "Don't leave and go do other stuff, please." because No, he won't. He's too locked in. Dude, we just while we're on here, we just passed last month past what 1.2 1.5 more. But yeah, we just passed what our last month is, which is good for us because we've been stuck in that little trap for like two three months. What changed mindset wise? Not tactically. Yeah. Oh jeez, that's a Wait, now you're mentality shifted throughout the team to push those units and numbers. Obviously, my guess is you had new mindsets enter the team that out pushed that, meaning like new hires, correct? Which is also tactics, but you know, mindset leads the tactic, how they frame. So, Ross, I I said this, I think it was yesterday's video or the other one. It it was like, what's the bottleneck is my thing I'm always like, and I do want to ask you that where you think yours is both personally and professionally, which is kind of one and the same for how we operate. But the initial bottleneck, the theory, and that's why I literally say bottleneck theory, is cuz it's like you might think it's something and then solve it and realize you're completely wrong. And like that's why you almost need to try and solve them quickly. Um, but we were, it was marketing, how marketing was set up, how it was structured, how the campaigns were structured, how we were using one ass, you know, one funnel that had already done 70 million, like all that stuff. It was time to change up marketing and how it was led and the mindset and then also the tactics then, right? over or you know downstream and then we changed that we fixed it and we were filling calendars and it was just like not backing out like it was backing out like the volume was the how do I explain that so it was like you know if you were doing 50 calls a day now you're doing 200 calls a day but you're closing at the same rate so like they went up but your cost per stayed I'm listening so like you're listening so like the cost per went up so we did four times more calls and we did four times more units but the cost per acquisition was like not good right like the conversion rate from one to the other was not and we're like oh it's still a marketing issue. I got some NA beers. Um and uh I'm like going through this whole thing and I'm like something is like it just doesn't make sense. And we're like oh it must still be marketing because the quality because the quality because we're testing new acquisition methods. So we're like oh we don't know if the quality is there. And then everything was kind of transitioning and transpiring with sales team and our sales leader that had got us from 1 to 3 million like did crush it for us and helped us in that and then was there when we broke acquisition kind of had to like fend and deal through that which is crazy right you have we had just moved everyone W2 we had done all this stuff and like now the calendars for these reps are half filled we're paying base salaries because everyone's W2 and we're like it'll be fixed in a week and like four months later. So like the morale like you're saying mindset changed. Yeah. And then when and then he went and started his own offer and like we're supporting him fully in that and then we had a new guy come in that XYZ has done you know nine figures in our exact industry in our exact niche in our exact whatever and comes in and then week one just sets the tone like just sets the tone. I love those people and is like here you're going to chat like what are your numbers? Nobody knows their numbers. It's like here are the numbers. No one knows they're this no like whatever. here's how you're going to do this one to ones with everybody on the team. The pass off was like executed amazing by both parties by the sales manager that was leaving that was amazing and then also this guy who came in and like like just crushed it and um we passed through this and literally same lead flow. We actually had I think two reps that like transitioned out or were already kind of on their way out. It wasn't like necessarily due to him um but had them leave and we you know it's let me not fake say this number. Yeah, 140 today. same lead flow. So it's like that's crazy. What I love those bro. Now the question is now the question is is marketing. So what's going to happen is 95 more changes to happen within that department. Marketing can it continue to fill and do it at a cheaper cost per as we go through or maintain cost per basically and do that. Can they then scale into these metrics and the next thing that's going to break is like marketing and all that. So, like that the mindset shift is like I'm telling you doing these videos and stuff and talking this stuff through. I I was talking to Luke about this this morning. I was like I uh I get some comments and some things sometimes that are like and I read everything. I I do I consume it all which maybe is bad but like people are like oh you know just like I don't know ego or like knows everything and all this and let me tell you I do not. But what it does come up when I'm doing one of these a day, like potentially trying trying to teach, it's like I understand it so much more. But I am definitely just like outputting 98% of the day and only consuming like two, which is on its head for what I did for the last 10 years. For the last 10 years, I did not say a word. I did not post a thing. I did not do anything. All I did was consume. That's awesome. Like to a bad point. So it's kind of like I'm just so extreme and I'm doing it this way. Like Luke was like, you need to literally just just like vomit it all for as long as you can. Yes. And then all of a sudden you'll just be like tank is empty other than like what we're doing now almost where I'm at. And then it's like and then the cadence begins. And I'm already there. I'm like I actively say I do not know a lot. I know this much about our industry that's this big. True. And then you go to online business and it's this big and then you go to like general business and then you go to life. It makes you feel so small though. That's why I said at the start of this like I'm still a student. Yeah. I you hear one thing and then you're like you kind of have there's this moment you have to learn how to take it well because I think some people hear it and they can feel so defeated but I I had to learn to take it and be like excited like oh wait I can learn more like I you mean I don't know it all. Yeah it's like I seriously like in business there's one thing and then I I model everything off of other people like almost to a fault. No, seriously. Like a life hack, like a funnel life hacker. Like I will say, and that has actually hurt me in the past when I didn't realize that you had to like Yeah. Well, uh more parts of them than only the part that you were initially trying to. So, for example, I have I have people I know or whatever that absolutely crush it. Crush it. And I'm like, "Oh, I want to be like this person." And it's like I do these things and then it's like, "Oh, you try to do their lifestyle and you try to do this other stuff." And it's like, "Wait, that goes against some other things that I have or maybe not at the time, but it wasn't serving me." And it's like, "Okay." Okay. So, it's like I look at you and no joke, I can be like, "Wow, you're, you know, posted up in this apartment. You have, you know, a wife. You're doing this. You're, you know, your goals are in alignment with that for you guys. You have No, but seriously, like you have that stuff. I look at me and it's like that part is not uh thriving for me, right? Like I spend all this time working. It's where my passion is currently." But like I would look to or who do I look to for that? It's like I look at a Dan Martell and I only know him from the internet, but like I feel like he's somebody who maybe checks a couple boxes in terms of how like his personal is and his business. I look at like a hormone Z and it's like how his life and business he and he clear as day says say says this is not for everyone and it's like I'm kind of operating in that mode right now but like it only works in the relationship dynamic from an outside perspective because they both are like in it doing it. True. Right. So it's like I don't know we're kind of going on a tangent here but like the the personal side of I am it's I'm definitely struggling to find because that's how I learn everything. It's like I want to find somebody who has what I want, who was where I'm at, who works like I do, who is similar to how I am, but then thrives in their in like personal life and that's everything. That's like a partner, sure, but that's also like friends, that's family, that's like where you live, that's how you that how do you give back? How do you do all those things? And like I am on that level right now because I'm doing this over here in work. I I love that you bring this up because I think a lot of people need to hear it because I remember I would get scioped or romanticized certain gurus or experts coming into the game very young. You know, being a 14-year-old kid being raised by bizop gurus of all sorts. Like I followed a lot of interesting people that led paths I'd never wanted. And I think the biggest thing that helped me was yeah learning and hacking the people that I wanted to be like like Mark Lack. He is married young has a kid. Yeah. also has a Urus, has millions of dollars and his big vision, but he's not sacrificing his marriage or his kids. So, I'm like, okay, let me how do you do it, Mark? And let me build like you. But I used to study guys who Miami bros who are which is nothing wrong with it. It's just not exactly. And there's nothing wrong with but you're spoiled the wrong person. And so I think for what you want though because guess what? There's a 14-year-old kid who wants to live in the penthouse in Miami and do it and whether that's life. I had to learn a lesson. I had a kid. Shout out Logan. Um, I'm gonna Can I name drop him because I give him some hype? Last hand. Yeah. Or do we not dox Seful? I mean, I mean, it's up to you, but I want to hype him up because he's been working hard. All right. Logan Jerome. Shout out Logan Jerome. He's next up. He's up. Uh, this kid in Minnesota who's been just locked in. Oh, is that the kid I met? No, that was Isaac. He's also locked in. He's one of another locked in. We got some locked in kids in Minnesota. Um, he's so cool. Shout out Isaac, too. Um, Logan Jerome, he's a kid who goes to my church. He came up, he started loving the agency game. He saw I was on Iman Gazi's channel and he's like, "Yo, like let's talk." And he's the one who actually did what I suggested. But what I found, the lesson I had to learn is I started suggesting my beliefs into his lifestyle that didn't align with what he wanted. And so he was cha going a different path that I just didn't go. But I was hurting I like I realized I was hurting his growth because I didn't agree with that. So I'd knock it. I'd be like, "Oh, blah blah blah blah." And I had to learn to like know he that's what he's doing. Push him towards that. And so as I think for people on here, if you're mentoring, if you're coaching, you also need to learn what do your customers, your students, your clients want and make sure that you're not in like putting your propaganda into their lives because he didn't want to be married at 21. You know, it's like so easy for that to happen. I have I have two I have one friend that I'm pretty like that crushes it that's older that is like kind of like still in just exploration party crushes it does whatever and like nicest but like great all this thing and it's just like there's certain pieces of lifestyle or whatever that it's like okay like not you know my but like it's so like such a good person such a nice person but like just how they live life and like how they built their business model and stuff it's just not in alignment necessarily with like how I'm currently in and it's just like it's difficult sometimes to like peace and part what what piece or you know what what you want to model it off of. Um that's no that's a super I I still am struggling very hard with trying to find someone that I want to and they come like here's the thing you put out the intention and they come. I remember I used to tell my wife I was like I really want to focus on my health but here's what I need. I told her the exact person. I said I want somebody who is entrepreneurial. They're growing their personal training fitness business so we could talk business while we're working out. I want them have similar beliefs being a Christian because I'm I'm religious and so I I want that and I want them to work out with me like one day a week, but I don't really want anything more than that. So I said this for two years and then this last year some dude comes up to me at my Bible study and he's like, "Are you reading your Bible?" I'm like, "Yeah." He's like, "Oh, I'm not religious, but I want to be." Cool. So I meet with him. We read the Bible together for weeks and finally he's a personal trainer. uh he becomes a Christian and then I pay him to be my personal trainer and he works out with me once a week and he's growing his business and he's similar beliefs now. It's like what the freak you have but it's like you have to put out these intentions of that type of person and I believe God brings them into your life at the right time and for different seasons and there's like different mentors for different seasons. Like I had a certain mentor while I was completely just all his stuff that's all I live by and I realized it was time to move on and no I mean I've done it I've done it with all the I mean I say I bought all the Google courses we did all the oven stuff exactly to a te all the people that followed Becker and then we're like info and I'm going to go create a SAS like everyone's tried you know that's what ovens did too and like people try to model it and it's like you know execution is a different thing but a lot of people tried to like run that gambit because they wanted to run the whole playbook not just like a piece of it a piece yeah like And sometimes you just need a piece of it that's your that fits with you. And then you grab a piece from over here and a piece from over there and it's like you architect. It's like assembly kind of like offer publishing. Speaking of offering so what's your everything comes back to where you stuck at where you stuck at like so right now it's what May 2025. So like do you guys do or you know I don't know what your team stack's like but if you're like quarterly annual like what are you trying offer publisher? I don't know. No, that's what I'm saying. Like you like what is your Okay. Okay. Well, here's the thing. When you have multiple offers in a report, like there's different pro everyone's had a different problem, which is back to going, you know, these are the problems with it. Yeah. Um I'd say for one, what are you trying to hit? What are you trying to hit? You're trying to take that one that has four monetization methods and that's going to be your golden goose. You trying to like where are you? You need operators. You need like ask you need operators. You need what? Like dude, I don't I don't know who this reaches. You have no idea. I do want I want Okay, let's put out some intent for who I want. Seriously. And someone's definitely watching this. I want a combination of a Blake. Okay, people don't know who that is. Or like, so you want a marketer? Sorry. Yes. See, dude. Blake's so cool. You need to interview him. I need a Blake. Yo, Blake, you're watching this. I need a Blake. You need a marketer? He's No, no, no. Um, well, he's a marketer, but he can stay in the weeds. You know what I'm saying? Like Oh, no. For sure can stay in the weeds. I need a I think it's 15 things, but like if I you know cuz for us you that's why I'm saying that I need a I need you. I need half you and I need half Blake. All right. I need you before the company you're in right now got really big where you found your role in just like tech and stuff like that, but you still dabbled in the other things. You know what I'm saying? Like you play multiple hats. I need someone like that right now with our current level who can be more in the weeds of some of these offers until we can replace them one role. Um, I'm more of the creative financial model builder, products, angles, messaging. When it comes to living inside of an ad account, making optimization, split tests, and changes. Don't put me there. I'll give you the ideas. You want like an integrator. You want like a marketing test run system. I want someone who can make sure our pixel's not muddy. All that freaking crap. I want to make someone our Okay, you're split testing this crap. You're doing this. you're I will do like the creative all the vision planning the products the ascension by integrator test products you can run I mean test offers not products test like cuz I'm going to tell you right now I have people in my DMs that specifically asked this who are like trying to be because again that's like kind of growth operator E and a lot of them like don't have necessarily full-on chops or experience but like they have but I don't care you can work your way up like you grit that experience that's what I mean so do you have ones that you could like if you had three of them come to you right now could you like deploy them in offers that you own and like test them and like find your person. Not three, but yeah, you one. I got one offer I can put them in and they can come in and test run it up and get because nice our deals are percentage and so I can give people like these fulfillment partners upside as well deals. So that's what you call them fulfillment partners. What's up? That you're calling them like that person to you would be like a a fulfillment partner. Yeah, they like kind of like a because I like um Yeah, they'd be a fulfillment partner. They have I'm just asking. I'm not I'm not judging. I'm asking. Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm just I want to clarify like there's some people like Craig who's running a full service agency where he's got a lot of accounts. I don't need a like I have Craig where he can handle things like that. I need someone who can be an integrator and focus on like be like you where you're on one offer and you're committed to it like you've been in yours. uh so that you can focus on that one and I could run to the next one and you know what I'm saying like yeah you need and the true thing you need is you need like a in my opinion is having that one that can go with you because that's like it's your Charlie Mer it's your it's your you know Andrew Wilkinson and his but here's the thing I don't I'm not trying to go to too many more like I'm the ne the legacy off of the four monetization maps that's like the f like that one because our products will be done for that the do you have um I have 45 we did well we did a we had a 45 4510 okay and so is it 10 the expert no that's the one dude who's scaled the offer like in the similar niche got it got so he's already has an offer doing he is already your marketing arm of that you're saying but he's more of he's not going to be like in the account yeah but again he can oversight the integrator be like Hey, correct. Correct. Well, it's like how I've been, and this is newer to me, but like we're breaking it down. Like today, I spent two hours with our bookkeeper, whatever, and rechanging our chart of accounts to make it sales, marketing, and ops more focused, not like fully, but like making it so we can have P&Ls that are specific. But that is for us how we're going to run like at scale. And again, you don't necessarily need to do that early, but like what you're talking about is like an operator, a marketer, and this in like one, which d you could have a lean like a lean team of a couple of you. The kid that uh kid the the adult male uh that was across from you at at our round table thing, he has a holding co that has a handful of people that he deploys. He has a CFO, he has like HR style, he has like all these other things. He just doesn't have the marketing arm right now or he kind of does but not like super. He wants to have someone basically is like that who like oversees it and can have you know people in those companies and see it. But like if you're doing that I mean it's essentially what it is. You just don't have a team to deploy and it's just you which is me which is me too. I literally talked to that the business coach today and I was like I have opportunities flooding to me. I want something with them but I cannot be in them. I refuse to leave this like golden goose. That's the hardest thing I had to learn like was say no. We we had someone come to us who their off last offered at 100 million. Um and they last deal they did with somebody was like a third they got 30 and they publisher got 70%. They were still coming to us like yeah we want you me and Mark to come on the deal but I was like I said no cuz I'm like I'm focusing on these other offers and like I had to say no it's just so much power in that though. So, but I knew like and it that's something I used to not and so I think yeah so that's I would say that's one thing integrator. Um another thing that I'm maturing in is financial models and understanding the best payment like structures to either pay people or for me to take in deals for it to make sense. Yeah. Um long term because there's a lot of early deals I do like that first deal where I got 30%. And they got 70. It's like at scale I'm like wait the goals I want to hit and this TAM how much I want to pay take home profit I was like I don't think I could ever get here with just that offer and I was like I would have if I would have set up the deal better. every deal you learn. What do you target nowadays? What is your if you don't mind? No, what do you target like for you for you? Because I mean, if you really think it's scale, it's going to be you and it's going to be your lean team, right? So, it's like what is right now it's just you. So, what is the number that like Tam backed out plus this and your margin you want to make percentage? Yeah. Like you you're not going to take something. You can't make more than or less than 20 grand a month or what's like what's your Oh, like take home from it. Yeah. Like if you're doing this model, you're doing it back. You're you're doing it in reverse, right? You're like, I won't do it unless I can take home like what's your number right now? Me 30 if it's not like if I can't 30ish. Okay. It's like cuz in my mind I'm like I could do one funnel build for 30. So like Yeah. Yeah. But here's the thing. There's what's tricky is some of these offers like the legacy one I'm scaling we're take we're starting with cold. We have some organic we start with but I understand that there's going to be a ramp up to that 30 and I'm going to have to be okay like in the trenches till we get there. And so that's why what's nice having these other offers that fund it because it's not as much like oh we're losing it's like so that's why I have these other offers funding this legacy offer. Uh and what do you what do you need funding for? No it's just capital like cash flow for I understand but like what do you for what? So you can pay software and ad bills. Yeah. Just so we can dump in ads and not be like, "Oh, we're los like just put it in." Boom. Boom. And I'm b testing budgets and stuff of 10 or 20 G's that you just allocate to the front end of it so you can like test because of Yeah. Usually go in a month, I'm like, "Hey, we're testing like we're willing to lose this much gambling. Hey, this is our budget. We're spending all of it." Yeah. So, every day it's like we set up like what are we willing to I don't say what am I willing to like cuz some people get caught up in making it and then they have to lose and they get mad. So, I'm like I'm going to a casino. It's like going to a casino. I'm going to my ad account. Here's our budget. We have to This is P&L. It's like having an accountant on retainer. The the we have to spend this much. We're going to spend this much. Yeah. And spend as fast as possible. Like some people, do I spend how much do I start with a day, Josh? Should I do $50 a day? 100? I'm like, okay, here. Like, okay, lifetime lifetime budget, five grand. Go. Cuz think, okay, $100 a day, 30 days in a month, $3,000, right? Like, okay. instead be like, "I'm gonna spend $3,000 on ads this month and I'm gonna do as fast as possible to get data as fast as possible and I'm gonna be okay losing that." Because you already are okay with it. You're just trying to make yourself feel safer being like, "Yeah, this much a day and then you never get true data and then you're like it didn't work. You didn't have put it in week try to spend in a week." I mean, obviously turn the ads off of there's indicators and there's all that, but I that's one thing that helped my mind. There's is there ever any team that you guys have to fund up front? Because like No. What do you do for high ticket for sales team? Yeah. Like how do you do that? Well, they just they do their commission. What do you mean? I know. But you just So like you're going to build one of these out and you want to build a high ticket on the back end. Yeah. What's the timeline of this? And then you what? Bring in a sales agency or a sales rep? Yeah. Boy, my boy Zack Rosson. Little docs him. God, you're just doxing everybody. You got to give the flowers. You got to give flowers to people who are single person's name. I don't think so. I I I said Eddie, but Eddie was on here. Yeah, but you got to give flowers, you know. You got to give flowers. Sure. Sure. Like to people who are Yeah. Actually good people. Zack Rosson, he's got his sales teams on are off. So, you get to a point where you're like, "Oh, this offer either off the get or at some point is going to need high ticket." It depends on the financial model. So, the the one the legacy one does not have high ticket involved. We're not going to have high ticket in that for the foreseeable future. Um that's part what it's data you're monetizing through volume and through like yeah tam right so subscription recurring um so we don't need buzzard two buzzard four now if I if I was going to do high ticket then I would have not I wouldn't have just taken 45% because then I got to give 20% of the high ticket to the doesn't make sense give the numbers what do you pay sales out you 20% 20%. Yeah. See, they place, they place closers, they place I don't take I don't review a single sales call. I do nothing. I send them leads. Tell you this. This either did not exist or I don't know why someone they're really quiet. It It's all the freaking dudes who sold now it's everywhere. Now it is everybody and their or I guess maybe we're just more Yeah, cuz every closer saw the model and they're like, "Oh, wait. Yeah, like that works." And they like people. Do you hear their economics? Do you know theirs? Who's the guy who makes 20 and how they it breaks out for how they make money? No. Oh, that guy you talked to at the event. Well, yeah. No, he's he's a badass, but like he gave a rough model and like we kind of talked about it. Um, and but that's an interesting business model because they'll make 20 points and it's like I look at our P&L and it's like what or what is our percentage of net new revenue that gets paid to a sales team and then also to setters and then also to a setter manager and a closer manager or a CS like the entire sales department. what is the percentage and if you mismanage that thing or like have it in whatever which way and then you add W2 and which kind of doesn't count but like you know I count it because I'm talking like true cash out right which is like% on top it's like you can get there or above there like on accident if you start stacking comp models and stacking stuff and who gets percents of what financial models are it's crazy what I mean though is like if the these guys who do 20% like that's a good deal sometimes that's a good deal sometimes if you can If you don't want to focus on it and like you just want to worry about marketing and you want to worry about fulfillment for x amount of time, you likely cannot sell with that, but no one's going to sell their business. So, I mean, yeah, like this new offer, that domain I bought and that dude, we're going right to high ticket. And I it's so it's like dude, what's up? What's the funnel type? Direct application or VSSL like just let's talk DTA. Okay. I don't I'm not an expert. Like I just do basic like what like do you do you delay? Yeah. Yeah, you got to gate it. You have a timer. When you where do you gate it? Do you gate it on like Vidalytics through there or do you gate it in time? On page time on page. Time on page or does this, you know, like elements or reveals in this many seconds? How long? Um, three, four minutes. Three, four minutes. Yeah, we just tested ours. I launched eight's really good on upsell, too. But what is eight minutes? If it's an ups if I'm doing an upsell and a low ticket funnel, then it's uh anywhere from five to eight minutes. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, we're running one right now that is uh that same one, but it's a five five minute minute delay. Okay, we're running one that's direct and not and it has right now 40% higher with the delay. 40%. Yeah, dude. Oh, you have to delay. Which is interesting because like initially we're running it and it wasn't and then we just so 40% on on just like what you when you with your delay I'm curious you you use any language like can they see the timer? Do you say your next steps it's just they're on the page just literally like running a clickbank offer where it's just like headline VSSL and then they just sit there and then like eventually it pops with the like with the CTA of you know get your bundle. I've always wondered I haven't really tested always uses language. I've always used language and a timer. So I can't really speak the other way because it's always worked well. But it is depending on the specification of the market. You have to change the wording and the verbiage of it. So how would you do a So like right now we have headline, sub headline, VSSL. We have mobile and desktop VSSL and then we have a section under that I have the entire block hidden that is Yeah. Yeah. So the timer to apply a button and then the two testimonial images. Yeah. So it' go video element then there'd be words and then timer. So it' be like words like for example your account like if it's an upsell we do basic like your login details will reveal in and then timer or your this gift will appear in this this bonus whatever your next steps will appear and then timer. So it's like word like a little column and then the timer so they see the time like okay I'll wait. Um, and so that helped, but I've never tested without. I know a lot of ClickBank offers do without. So they obviously they test way bigger volume then. Yeah. Yeah. No, they do they do numbers. Um, what would you do on a cold? What would you do on a cold though? So like you know ours, so like if it's an application, would you be like your uh you can apply in and then just I thought if your VSSL they finish the VSSL or book call, don't they get something a bonus a gift? Mhm. I just lead with I'd say is like I'd test that. Like I don't know if it it depends if it makes sense. That's an interesting idea. You already get it. You're already lucky. You already have it. So it's like Oh my I didn't even think about that. It literally says it in the beginning of the VSSL. Your bonuses. It says at the start of the VSSL, too. Oh. Yeah. It's like if you stay to the end, you get your All right, Blake, if you're watching this as your head CMO, Blake, I'm going to tell you to split. Just kidding. Watch it. Well, no, cuz they were I mean, we're running it direct and honestly, we're focused on the other ones. We just said we had two brand faces, new brand faces fly out and could do a toz full VSSLs, multiple leads, multiple whatever for a VSSL optin funnel. So, we're going to have three core that we're going to test with different faces, different ads, different whatever. We're going full dude. We're going we're going full boore. And then idea is then low ticket around each one. So, you're going to have two to three funnels around each one. Each one going deep. He's going deep. Going wide and deep within the Why would you duplicate the whole thing though, Ryan? It's a lot of work. Yeah, because No, you want here. Actually, I want to talk about this because I had this conversation with uh with Luke and he was like and he still does at some level have this vision of like oh you know nine of these right and it's like all the whatever and my whole thing has always been nine inside one which is exactly what you were kind of saying earlier which is inside one inside of main co you have nine faces they can have different angles they can have different low ticket products they can have different like entry points but they all go into the same thing. the second that I have to dupe out a HubSpot instance and have two different branded domains, two different senders, two different ever like of everything versus why I mean why versus you can do it all within one. I mean think think you know Agora think all these big boys right it's like yes they use different brand name one so like that's the that's the nth degree version of that am I not allowed to say that no no no I had you're reminding me of something a little nugget talk about depth all right so you know why I have multiple offers too like our portfolio all our offers can JV each other and promote each other that's real that's real that was Mark acting he taught me he's like every offer we sign it has to be compatible to be an affiliate. So, we're running traffic. Then we cross all offers to each other. Do you do that? Yeah. Yeah. All our offers email list to send to the other one. Yeah. You say, "Hey, so and so is doing this." You promote I have an when we went to uh Copy Accelerator event with Stephan. You say it's Stephan where Allan spoke. No, I was at the one in Scottsdale. Okay. And that's where we actually met Eddie for the first time. Um we like kind of knew of him a little bit, but we met him in person and then he hosts the best dinners and we went to that stuff and he um there was a guy there that was talking. He was like, "Oh yeah, you guys could make an extra, you know, 200 a month or whatever the number was on our on our math of how big our list size was." He was like, "How many people buy your stuff?" And it's 1% of our leads for the high ticket. Let's say all those other people. And he was like, "What would you you know, and we still are like I'm I don't know. I'm like against it." It's it is here's the thing because you like get rid of you have the potential to get rid of potential buyers like you have but one if you don't have any other offers. It's like the Hormosi thing is like his uh if if you're doing a JV if you're doing a JV deal you're doing a partnership or whatever and they're making more money than you are like you're doing the like your model's wrong kind of thing which is real. It's like, you know, and that could be postpurchase, that can be a lead, that can be a buyer, that can be, you know, a client, that can be a lead. And I don't know, I just never and he and they were like, oh, the way you risk mitigation. And I think this is great, but they're like, oh, dupe the list. Like have it go into two and then have like, you know, your Aweber, your omnisend as a separate thing, sending from the same like Yep. niche, but like a different name and then like a whole different thing and it's just monetize it on affiliate. It's like, you know, there's people who do that and then they they charge, you know, 10 or 20% of it and it's your list. You're just feeding the list, but then it's like, are they link I've heard of people that link split then to their own stuff. I've heard that people, yeah, you get pretty what are they promoting? I'm like I just don't tr I I don't know. I just don't trust them, nor do I know anyone. I It usually happens in Bisop. Great. Like what's so funny is people will sell bisop and if they can't convert like in a webinar promo cycle if you click a link or like right after the webinar is done if you don't buy they immediately start promoting a new business opportunity because you might not have resonated with the other one and they keep every and if you keep saying no until finally you buy into a business opportunity it's a I mean the model works it's just not really my but I want to be able to be like oh hey this is building an exit and like you're building a brand like you're not building a gray hat like a and guess what even they can't exit and like again like which statistics would say we have like a 01% chance or whatever if you you know I name name four people that have sold their info coaching thing properly at like a re like at a real size right like you just said your guy did that one I know like I mean I know one who did it and actually turn but like when you sell it usually I mean most of the acquisitions the deals fail but okay yeah I mean I mean like did it and he even says in his like licensing it was all the back and money. It was the grouping thing I think with supplement like he talks about it. I haven't depth into it but like you know it's hard if it's a guru centric one. Yeah. It gets a little Yeah. Well, you Oh my god. The list of things you need to do if you're running a like a normal info coaching guru business is like founder risk is like team structure. It's like making it a machine. I was a part of one that tried to exit bad of what? I was I forgot. I was a part of a company that exited and it backfired really bad on him. I was like the CMO on Yeah. the buyer and then I mean the buy the guy who sold it eventually got something legal happened because it was like there's Yeah. It was bad and I was like don't sell I'm the CMO. I'm like like it was cooked like or it was just a bad deal. Like he sold the education company to somebody who had no experience in this space. Kind of sold him a dream. And I'm like no you can't just hand off the face. The face is going to leave. I was like, "Don't, no, don't do it." And he sold it. And then it backfired because we're Oh, this guy left and the customers got mad. They all started refunding, disputing, and then this Oh, it was so bad. So, yeah, I've seen it go really bad. Yeah. I mean, I It's seen it go good, too. Yeah. There's a lot of buy, sell, biz stuff around this. That's like what are the core pillars of what you need in order to actually be able to sell one of like something in general, let alone an info coaching. It just needs Yeah. It needs to get to the level of exactly consistent future. You know that what is theood? Yeah. Cash. It's like how much of a machine is it? What are the risk pieces of it? And how do you mitigate those? Like that's everything from a traffic source to a funnel type to a face to whatever. And then on the back it's the same thing. It's like what are they buying? Is the fulfillment you know commoditized? Is it recurring? andor what is the you know what is the recurring that you know is going to happen into the future every number to a t financials booked and then the whole company running without the people that are going to leave when they sell it right it's like that's the generic version and there's 19 other things I don't know or that you know aren't on that list and damn yeah and then to get to size too like that um there's a couple guys one guy just sold one for I think five or another guy for like two and like that's cool but like if you get this thing up to scale like you can do two to five Yeah, some people are okay with that's one year. Yeah, that's less than I mean like depending on your size that's some people just but if you're just pumping an offer like it is. So yeah, you pump it which I feel like that's where I fall into. Like if I think about my thing, dude, if you're playing a cash flow game, I mean that's what a lot of these guys do and why not. But like this next one I'm building I'm like nah like I feel like this has to be with where it's going. I mean, yeah. Like knowing the TAM and the problem it solves, it'll always be here. Like I'm like, you don't, it's not gonna be a, oh, exit at a, you know, you do a million profit for three years, you exit at 3x multiple only three million. It's like, no, it's got, I feel like it's got to be more. Like the one the one dude, uh, that I was telling you about who does only low ticket. Um, like he was talking about their valuation for their company and like what they're going to exit. It's crazy. Like he opened my eyes like what's possible and they're like looking for Yeah, I won't say numbers, but it's like multiple. It's not just a $3 million exit. you know, and so I was like, "Wait, really? You could do that?" Yeah. What do you think of uh uh info plus plus physical? I have a guy that I talked to that does I mean like what's an example which again you don't have to say like the name of the company or the whatever health offers. So like what like info coaching and then supplements. Yeah. Protocols, lifestyle stuff on the front end and then supplements. What's another one? Because that's like which is great because everyone's consuming it's recurring. It's whatever. But like what's something that's like cuz I feel like a lot of the stuff you do which I like you know give you credits for is you know you said piano thing you said like in this in you know whatever like you do it outside of like MMO but like where do let's be clear I have done but never zero to one. I've never done zero to one bisop but yeah a lot of it like my it's so funny because the biggest offers that I've done are not like they're because they have beer tam outside of bisop like the piano that was what that is what our tweet exchange our tweet exchange was about was all about the oh sorry go you were breaking up I didn't hear you what marriage no yeah I was just saying like marriage hu relationship bro like I would love to publish an offer again in the marriage industry one because I believe in it I believe in marriage I believe like the problem like pain point. I'm married. Um like there's someday I' like that's the next one I feel like I'd get into. Um homeschooling that market's big. Like I because I was a homeschool I taught a homeschool class like a co-op and so I have this domain for another legacy offer I'm going to launch when I'm like 30 maybe 40. Um yeah it's it's sick. I love the name. It's the domain carries everything, bro. But yeah, these other markets like you think make money online is I thought that's where all the money is made. It's like oh it's easy to sell money at a discount. But it's getting like I don't know the people that make big bucks. Yeah. They're not. Yeah. There. And then here's the thing. The people who are doing big bucks with make money, it's gray hat. There's gray hat. White hat. Okay. Well, there's one guy um one guy who I'd say is very white hat business opportunity, but it's not make money online. It's clean bisop, which is like traditional businesses like career. So tech is a big one. want to know I I helped offer on that. That's what I that's actually that's funny you say that that was what I was going to do for a second when I was kind of like navigating and we were having conversations around this about like next steps and like what the plan was for this company and like we were going to keep it as a cash flow business for like like a year ago we all sat down and we're like that's the goal is to get this to a margin where it is sit there like we all have other interests and stuff and it was like this can only get so big like that's where our frame was at which is so silly but yeah that dude I used to think that way and I'm like seriously and like again our TAM is obviously massive but we were just kind of like that's where this sits. and that's how this lives and like we just weren't educated or like what are your thoughts like and even sorry I'm cutting you off that mindset of this is how big it can really get like let's say you even have a small smaller TAM I'm realizing why even have that mindset why not be like I'm going to get everybody in this TAM then like or when we talked to I mean when I did that call with Adam Young he the Ringba guy he literally was like they own so much market share of their TAM that all he does now, not all, but that was an over over like easy, but all they do is create content and books and whatever to grow the TAM, not get more market share of the TAM. True. He's like, we already own whatever it is, 30%, 80%, whatever number of the TAM of paper call in both sides. And they're they're essentially a connector tool, right? They're software. They are like a marketplace. There's buyers and sellers. there's companies that need leads and then there's companies and people that provide leads simply put and through paper call right and he's like the industry is only this big and it's going to be this big and I'm going to continue my market share size if not grow it but I'm going to grow the whole TAM so that I could maintain like crazy I do 50 million a week instead and I was like what and he was like yeah how would you just get to 50 million a week and it's that idea of like huh you know you have a list of 10 things you're going to do if you want to double this year and it's like if you want to 50x this here you have like one thing you can do and it's that mentality. What are your thoughts on the mentality like the people are like I feel like it's pretty limiting or what made me have that was people being like oh it's okay to have a lifestyle business and they're like they kind of make me cop out like take the way out. Um it is okay to have a lifestyle business. You know how nice it is probably to make three to five million bucks and like actually want to have a life and like go do all that stuff. But you're saying lifestyle they would cast a vision way too low. Like I'm talking the people I've been around they're like if you have make like 10k a month like 20k like but I'm like but here's the thing I think about inflation how the dollar decreasing businesses it's lifestyle okay it's goal and lifestyle there I know I know people right now that if they were making 10 or 20 online would literally drop everything would be making three times what they make in their job and could like bounce around and do minimum travel thing like that's not my interest so I I agree with you but like there are people like I could call five people I know that would literally pick that up in an instant and that would be their dream life. Yeah. I feel like the issue is like for if people watching this or even um I don't think anyone's still watching this. We're an hour and 50. No, they definitely are, bro. The consumption on like it'll be crazy. They're should I do mid roll ads every every minute and a half? No, we're they're going to transcribe it then put it into chatbt and what are the takeaways? So, AI is the takeway. I'd say if you if someone's ever hit you with a lifestyle like you can have a smaller like I would say just challenge that thought for a second because you may be built for more and you maybe could do more maybe you want that and I realized for me I bought into idea of like oh lifestyle keep it small and then there was always something in me where it's like no more you could do more you can and then I was like I had to accept that new identity because I put this one on that just didn't fit. So all I'm saying is like I think you should challenge it just like challenging going deeper like how you challenge that thought in me and I'm like yeah 100%. like dang you can go deeper. Yeah, I think I do actually I still do want to go back to the depth thing and do like a thought exercise. But the uh the my my thought around that or like my how do I say this? The for me what I've currently identified as the goal is just progression is like the one word. It is progression. That is in personal, that is in business, that is in physical, that is I love that you're not putting a dollar on it then and then you there's no dollar. It's a scoreboard. Yeah. and it's like fun and like stack it and do this, but like my how I feel. So, which is also a progression, right? Is like my my level of peace or whatever. It's like if you put, you know, there's a game to be played where it's the next thing and the next thing and there's trophies and whatever. And like I love it. Like I I still do it at some level or like set them, but I set them for the thing. It's like I could have gotten this laptop as a simplest example, you know, a very long time ago and instead I literally set it at like 25 I set it at 2500 subscribers just as like my number and then so I could get it and I love this laptop and it's great and my videos don't do this now and I did it and I'm happy because I did videos for 40 days in a row or something to get it. And it's like that's kind of fun for me is like the progression, the growth and like seeing the channel and stuff is like cool. And it's like my goal of this was three to 5k on all platforms and then just like have a network and it's like I hit that and it's like I haven't redefined what the goal is but the progression of work in the business and like my skill set stacking and the leverage and the growth and like what I feel in that the gym what I like my goal you know there's as much around progression that that exists within maintenance and maintaining something any like I don't want to say anyone but like anyone can hit a goal you know how hard it is to like stay. It's like anyone can get ripped once, right? It's like stay there and exist ripped. And it's like there's these different examples of that that I've kind of is what I'm trying to define it as. And this is also me saying that I was the guy who like like I you know I don't have the personal thing at all figured out. I don't have so much figured out. And it's just like what I'm focused on right now is what I'm trying to easily say is just like just progress. Just get like better. Just the 1% that unlocks something for me. I that that that word I like that I know and it's just simple and it's just real because it's not uh the business a certain size it's not a certain fitness thing it's not a whatever it's like these grouping of goals that are simple that are one to three things a quarter in each domain like in you know in your personal in your business in your partner or like relationships friends family partner your whatever and just like kind of set some um and again I'll be the first to say like if I'm not good at this like there are times where I'm very bad at this and I can't do it or I or I fail at Not that I can't do it, but yeah. I don't know. Just stuff around that for me. But I will say the I don't even know how I got on this, but the other thing that I was talking about this morning with the or the biz coach brought up to me was like having the day of the week or the day of the month or something where you zoom out and like re like relook at your plan like pull out of it. Oh yeah. Be introspective. Yeah. zoom out and be like, "All right, so you're a machine 12 hours or 18 hours a day doing all these things that you set an intention of a month ago or a week ago or whatever and like do you still want to operate in this? Is this still serving those progression goals? Are you actually progressing or do you need to change the strategy?" And like I need to do that with this. I'm on day 67 or eight in a row of this and like I'm just living within I'm a cog within the machine that I created. And it's like do I want to zoom out and change my approach? And that's kind of what I'm doing with these videos, these like conversational ones instead of me just spewing like, you know, more or less updates. Like there's so much value in the beginning and there still is, but it's like a different type where I can only, you know, I can go deep dive in these buckets, but yeah. So blah blah blah. I like I think that's important. Progression. Progression. I like that. No, I'm holding on to that. That's good. Like if I get one thing from this like that I'm taking, that's my thing cuz I I need that one. Mine is your bonuses unlock in five minutes. Mine's very tactical. I hope it works. I was going to say you doing that we could crack like numbers. Am I doing that? I don't know. I said just that one thing. That's that's I try and say that all the time. I'm like for the six six figure a month the seven figure a month guys. There is literally one thing you pick up in something I said or I hear from somebody that is like oh and that adds one or three or five or 10% to one of your KPIs in the middle and that can be millions a month. True. Whereas like if you're just starting up it's like it doesn't matter. No, anything works. GHL works, Click Funnels works, this works, that works. A low ticket works. Like like everything works, dude. Let's talk W. Go ahead. I love W. Yeah, they're cool guys. Well, here's the thing. I just like being wind and dine. Let's be real. I like when the credit card companies wind me. Travel company. I told I told Hunter that today. I said he's like, "How are you liking the product?" I'm like, "Bro, this product could suck, but if you keep I don't give a crap. I'm going to run." They're good dudes. They're good dudes. We still haven't moved any of our stuff over. We're talking about using Split. We're talking about using split it, but the biggest thing is split it. Let's talk gamecher numbers for people. All right, let's talk six figure, seven figure people. You want to make some more money? I would do that. I would do that if I wasn't in our current setup. Split it and um the refund the customers are a lot better. I found actually because what happens you split it? Split it. Yeah. The people who use split it, you're saying the customers are better. Yeah. Here's why. Let's say you have a customer. Let's just do mid ticket. All right. So, mid ticket, $1,000 offer, $997, classic webinar offer. What back in the day, what we'd have to do is you would offer two time payments of 597 or like three time payments of 397 or four of whatever, right? Bro, if you look at who's refunding before the like in that 30-day window where you're offering it, who's cancelling? Bro, it's all those people because that if they didn't have $1,000, 200 is still pushing it for them. But now with a $1,000 offer, you they can pay $83 a month with no fees, interest on their end, and they will stay past that 30-day window more. They're not as like, I want out, and then they'll give it more time. So for you, your refunds will go down. The customers I found, they respect the product more. They're not this anxious person who is like, I have this much time to make this much money back or to get this result, lose this much weight, find my girlfriend. So um do you price in the fees? Um, obviously I I have other ways to get fees. Um, but I do know people that do price and fees. Um, I think that's gray area with financing. I know people who do both, but like I don't know if you're sometimes like, but you could justify. I mean, think about it. If you do a payment plan, normally they you'd say, "Hey, if you don't do painful, you're going to pay more of our time." So, I don't think it's that big of a problem. Yeah. Yeah. No, I It's I would do it. It's like for me right now how the the flow of our data, the flow of our pay size, we would have to like do so many different things, different order forms or we have to move everything. And if I moved everything, it's like now subscription management lives in there and like all this stuff and like I I love those guys. I love the product. I think it it's great. Like I would never have our customer base in the pro like actually in there like our we would never put our community or our products in there just because of how the vibe and the look and it's kind of more young money like onlineyum which is amazing. Again it's great. It's just like not really our demo style. But I love their options. I love what they're doing. I think it makes a ton of sense. And like if I was to offer something or like I would in two seconds sign up and use that. Yeah. Um I almost bought something the other day. I think we actually we're looking at something right now that's like, you know, 30 grand and I and they have a split option on there and I'm like, "Okay, cool." Like, "Why wouldn't we for agencies now?" I was telling my agency friends, it's only onetime pay, obviously, though. What do you mean? They're one-time payments that you can split it. They're not You can't rec Okay. Yeah. Where you going with this? Oh, no. I was just telling like my agency buddies, they like lose a lot of clients and their cash flow is a big issue because, you know, return and whatever. and signing a year contract. It's tricky because it might just cancel anyways. And so I was like, "Bro, why aren't you just using like split it and get them like a long How is this not going to backfire? It's going to Well, how is this not going to backfire? It's like you're like churn does not exist because of the payment method they use. Churn does not exist because of the payment meth. What do you mean? If those people were going to turn on you, they're gonna churn on like there is a still a percentage that is going to churn and there is going to be default risk on the other end of that that is like not your problem. I understand but like but it's somebody that's why I'm saying you that's where the offer owners people watching this you have to just like you use CLA like you have to be okay with offering someone Clar or Afterpay knowing that they're going to maybe miss their payment or credit card fees like what are you what's the responsibility you're willing to take and make one is if you're going to get kicked off platform because you have too high of one which is real and that's with you have a direct relationship with any of them and I don't know how the risk mitigation occurs across the entire you you know, it's going to get I mean, at some point I feel like it gets No, those guys crushed and like clearly they have done it and they've done it with high-risisk stuff across, you know, white label on multiple things and like they have done their job with it. So, I'm not saying I'm not saying them specifically, but you look at some of these other finance partners and like I had one that a lot of I a lot of coaching companies use and I have done many a demo and vendor research on this and had math models broken out and they will go, "Okay, cool. Your customer is going to pay, you know, 18% basically, but it's baked in. It's this flat number. Everyone gets it. you're going to pay X percent or what hits your bank account. And then we also have on the back end, you know, a 3% collection thing. If it gets over this threshold, we start to pull from the funds from future this or out of a bank. I'm like, I want to own your business. I'm like, you make money here, you make money here, and you never lose money. Take someone to collections, which is like that's when it happens is we have to like someone ramps an offer, sells $3 million worth of stuff, and then ghosts and like we have to collect. So like they have risk but like in their their actual model they're just churning. Yeah. Those guys take money too as like you know you because they need Is it kind of like credit card companies where they kind of want you to miss your payment? Well yeah because they want the Yeah. I mean they want the it's kind of like I could never you have to have the you have to have the bank for that. The literal bank for that in order to finance it because you you Okay. Have you heard of private credit? How big that is? Yes. Yeah. So it's like I do anything in that world at all and I think it's that you want to talk about someone with an LTV to CAC ratio is anything that have that on the back end anything that has money management anything that has like financial instruments in terms of insurance private lending uh um through some of the different financing partner like there are guys that have you know multiples of these because they did did it through financing. There was a guy at that dinner which I that was actually we talked after that dinner but there was a guy at the dinner that we were with that knew how much people get based on XYZ criteria. They run it through the application and they get like 90% of the people up to a 26 they they price their product based on how much the loan approvals are for that exact criteria with a with a partner they have. So they'll just rack 26 and then they know on the back cell they have somebody else that'll take the same loan and add 15 G's to it and like play this game. And like again, shout out to them and they have people who have great success and I'm sure they have a lot of people who don't, but like that's not my game. Yeah, that's how I mean that's how a lot of these guys do size. I mean it can justify especially if you have ROI justification if you're selling something that someone can make like an ROI but like ROI and like we don't we I mean I've I've never sold something that has ROI justification although like it's transformation it's it's you know it's you know without guarantees without anything guarantees bro. Okay. All right. All right. Want to share a little gray a little gray gray hat? Okay, this might be No, I was going to say I got I got nothing for you. So, go ahead. Shoot. All right, people. Actually, I don't know if this you got Okay, tell me if this is bad or not. People are watching this at 2 hours and 1 minute in. Yes, there's die hard. Hey, shout. If you're watching at two hours, comment below. And you can't do comment. Comment two. Two. Let's see how many real ones are. And yeah, maybe we'll give you something. We'll give I don't want this to become a podcast. Is this considered a podcast? No, podcasts. Podcasts are different top Well, shoot. We did hit a bunch of topics. There's not se interview and like whatever. And it's like I almost I posted that one of Eddie the other day and then I almost posted the meme right after and it's like guys just need therapy but instead they start a podcast or whatever and I was like damn like that hits like it just and I don't that's not the intent of this. The intent is to build a audience of six and seven people. It's I mean my whole why I interview people is like to find the operators behind the scenes. Like that's like why I started I was like who's behind the people and like I wanted to I'm not an operator so I need to hang out with people like you because then it so like yeah we like for me I'm like selfishly but I also want to highlight the people who don't get highlighted a lot anyways. Yeah, that's fair. But yeah, it's not a podcast. Not a podcast. No. Okay. Tell me if this is this is gray or not. I heard this from a lady. She's made a lot of money selling courses and her whole thing is creating courses that people consume and finish and get results from. So, I love that. Like she does it from a good heart, but what people say, this is like a non it's like a compliant way to talk about outcomes, but instead of saying guarantee, you say goals. So, you say the goal of this program is make $10,000 a month. Like the goal at the end of the program, the goal is you hit this. If now we're not promising you're going to hit this goal, but we've set up the product in a way so that we can get you to that goal as fast as possible. And like you So you're you because it's a goal. It's like oh you hit the goal. So yeah. Yeah. So you're asking if that's gray. Do you think that's gray? So there's white or black. That's white. And you can't guarantee that they're gonna hit the gold, but you say, "Hey, the go." So is Yeah. So it can tell you this. I know that people have had sales recordings uh looked at by, you know, government agencies that have looked at it. And if you use the sales classic style, the here's your current state here. What's your dream state? And bridge them to that because you're saying, "Okay, I make Yeah, I make zero." And they're like, "What's your goal?" And my goal is to make 25. And you're like, "I'm the one that gets you to the 25." and saying that you are gonna get them to that is like an implied a shoot. So, it's not compliant then. Yeah. Supposedly, and again, this is I don't I don't know. We've never had to deal with stuff like this. We don't use guarantees like that. We don't use anything that's like that. We don't use, you know, time frame like anything. So, um but I have definitely heard that that that if framed the wrong way can be used like that. That's what I feel like could be I don't know. I feel like that's not terrible. It's like what our target is and like this is not you know typical results which is Yeah, true. You probably have to have crazy decision. Very hard. How are you going to say that in the same sentence? You're like, "Oh, yeah. Our goal is, you know, we get everyone to 10K." And it's like, "But it's not typical." Like, how are you going to say that? Well, no, you don't say we the goal like I feel like the pitch would be like, so you'd reframe it. So people like, is there a guarantee? Like if you're in a webinar, for example, I'd be like, now I see a lot of questions people ask me, is there a guarantee? How much can I make from it? It's like, well, legally, I cannot or what you can say is this, like I have specific numbers in my head that I know are realistically possible for people to hit that I've seen people hit. I have in my head. can see those numbers, but legally I cannot say that because it'd be misleading. And you guys all know the people who are scammy who have told you stuff before. And so I'm not going to tell you that. But what I can say is we have a goal. We set goals just like how you know you're trying to lose weight. You set a goal for how much you're trying to lose blah blah blah blah. Like there's a goal to win the game. You know, you want to score a touchdown. Like these are the touchdowns in our program. Number one is to get you your first 1K a month. The second goal is D. And so you'd reframe it that way maybe. I don't know. And then you say now these results are not typical. I don't know enough about this because exactly because I know that when you do results a lot of times I'm just saying you personally your personal morals gray, white or black. That's pretty white. Okay. I don't think that's that bad. I mean depend again it really comes down to the language. So I don't know. I mean that's Yeah. Yeah. I mean and the lady made her justification. Go ahead. She said that her consumption went up so high in her courses because throughout the whole program it's like here's the goal like step hey guys it's like great. So I think it's good for the customer and then people actually got the goal because whereas most people now they don't actually engineer their courses to get results. So it's that's honestly more great. Exactly. And that's a huge thing you want to talk about we had a whole conversation about that today around how because we just launched our that retention program today that backend program you did it and yeah but then the idea being you know everything's a funnel. The framing of how they're getting on the call to renew is not ideal because of how the the fulfillment is of the initial year because we've basically been servicing a contract not framing it for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, continued access, all that stuff like that hasn't existed. So because of that, yes, we get the result, yes, we fill in the contract, yes, it's amazing and we have all that stuff happen, but they're not in an activation way built that year one is your this, year two is where you, you know, what's a good one? You know, year one is where you build, year two is when you multiply, year three is when you, you know, exponential like and but only talking about year one and servicing on year one makes it so your year two is like not good. like you don't like people don't know what's coming next. They don't have something out there. They don't have a road map. They don't complete the first year and get a medal shipped to them in the mail that's like you're you know you completed this and now you're in your multiply phase and like that stuff is real. Yeah. When it comes to LTV and it comes to that kind of stuff, right? True. So if you can do both, if you can make the model so that your backend has higher margin, which it already out of the gate will because you won't have acquisition and sales, you might have retention, but if you can make it so the fulfillment is also low because it's like a one to many, it's your software, it's your whatever and it is truly like sticky in like a in a good good way as in like people get pissed because their subscription cancels like you know their payment fails, they get pissed or because whatever like that is what I am starting to lean lean towards over the last 30 60 days of understanding that is something that we've never focused on. It's total leaky bucket, right? It's like we're making we're making money more or less on the front end, not as much on the back end like at all. And we flip that on and like your entire economics two, three, 10x. Yeah. Yeah. Like hard. And that's what's exitable, you know? It builds the enterprise like all all of that. Not just one part of it, but the whole whole machine. So that's fire. What else you got? Or should we wrap? I've always got stuff, bro. I'm sure you do. You always chilling. All I know is it's 9:22 p.m. here and I Are you Where do you live? Don't worry about it. What does your daily routine look like? Ryan Clark, day in the life. Ryan, would you ever do a vlog, dude? You got to do vlogs next. That would go viral, bro. Because you're so mystical. Like, I literally think like, what does he do during the day? Like, does he just take Zins and nicotine and work? like why is he so he's like I just had a cup of coffee. Um like what's your daily routine right now in this mode when I was cranking when I was doing these initially it was up at you know 5 and then if I wake up before that I have to stay up because if not I fall asleep and it's like 7 or 8 and then I hate my life for the entire day and I think I ruined it. So it's like just get up when you get up and stay up and then I just hit the desk and then in the morning it's like that's the only time that people aren't on Slack and like messaging. So it's like my deep work zone is then. So it's like deeper work early in the morning if I want to build something project tech like all that I do in the morning. I build management list ops stuff. I go through chat like all that stuff. Then I used to then also do my video right off the rip. That was the best because I could build the technical stuff and when I was doing all like the funnel maps and the percents and all that, I would do it then and then I would either film it then or then it runs into time when people start like waking up and being in communication channels. So then I talk on that and now it's like it's a mix. I do like stuff like this and then I also do stuff that's in the main co and do that. middle of the day, go to the gym, come back to this, do more of this, and then this is a lot of time when I have like meetings or conversations or stuff is after that. And then I eat somewhere in between there and then I'm done at 9 or 10 and then I do it again six, seven days a week. Crazy. Um, people have got some questions on Twitter.
