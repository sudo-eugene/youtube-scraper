In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we're using setters to double our sales. I'm going to walk you through the different sources we are using and show you where they are visually on a funnel map and then talk about the different categories of how we are marking them in the CRM from the different sources and what their outcomes are for show and live call close. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. 70 million in that business in total. That 30 mil was last year. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Now, apologies, I'm on mobile and I'm in Texas in a hotel room. If the loom glitches out, I'm sorry. So, sources to start, we have app no book. I'm going to break these down and show you, but app no book financially qualified booking confirms DQed, so disqualified booking confirms, low ticket op, low ticket buy, no auto, low ticket auto call, no show cancel, Mandy fall off, and custom time requests. Now, let's walk through these. So, app no book, what that basically means is actually twofold. So, app no book is basically meaning that somebody applies but does not book. Okay, so they all of these go into a Slack channel that are named setter whatever and then they are hitting these channels. So we have like different pods within the setters. And for quick reference point, we did 70ish of this with no setters. We've only had setters for a month now and we have like a sicko setter manager that came on the team that is crushing this for us and it is like an absolute production department. Like they are hitting crazy numbers for us. It was hundreds of sets last week. Like we had one day we were like 42 sets which is crazy for us because we were booking 150 calls all through marketing with zero setters at all. only closers, only volume, which we learned. We probably left like I don't even know 30, 50, some crazy number on the table. So, right here, you're gonna have app, no books. Now, these are people who applied but didn't book, and that is the first time we get the phone number. So, we do have this Mandy portion here, which is like a Mandy fall off. And what that means is that an AI is going an AI bot is going to text them if they apply, but don't book within 5 minutes. Okay. Now, this happens 24/7. So, we're basically trying to get them to call. As soon as someone calls or contacts them, the AI turns off. But if they're not online, we have like 14 of them now already. So they have pretty much good coverage. But if they're not over the weekend, stuff like that, it auto texts. Now that the what the AI could not do was handle the voice portion because it's still like we've tested a bunch of them. It's just not good enough. So now that they're dialing, it has like a massive uptick. Now the Mandy falloff portion is basically saying that when the AI gets alerted that there's something where the person needs like human interaction, it fires into a channel and then they do it. Okay, that's that one. This is the FQ and the DQ. So FQ is right here inside the process. So VSSL funnel across here, direct application funnel here, low ticket funnel here. Now when someone applies but then doesn't book, we hit them. When someone books and then is sitting here, we're now just rolled out a call confirmation team. Okay, so these people, we've had this for a really long time through a call center. It was like 20 hours a day, seven days a week. Uh they would dial, but they had a dialect and they had like a script where we kind of try to keep them clean. So because they didn't know too much about the company and it was just difficult. So we just now replaced them a week ago on both the DQ and the main Q uh or the main financial qualified with the actual setting team to do this. Now I'm going to get to the stats on these on confirmed sets of what these are. Um but it is like night and day in comparison to what we had when we were using that team and that team was already like 70% higher than when we didn't have any confirmations. But this is working very very well. Now, next portion, everything is in this low t low ticket bucket. So, in here, low ticket, somebody uh basically begins the process to check out. So, it's a two-step. So, they'll put in their name and email, and they'll go to here. Now, this one's a little more difficult because it's all via email because we don't have the phone number. So, we're talking about adding the phone number, but we don't want to break the stats. If the loom is glitching, I'm sorry. I'm on mobile and it's not great. So, um this one is all email, but we're talking about adding a phone number for here, but this is a big one. So when we we're optimizing the funnel in the low ticket for ascension. So someone's going to come in here and they're going to book here with a setter directly. If they do not, which is like 40% of them, so we already have like a 60% take 60 to 70% take rate, which is great. But for those 40% that do not, we then are setting it up a channel to live call them to try and get them on the phone or more so just do the live set there and then push them over here to a sales call. Okay. So all of these are pushing to a sales call, a set with a closer. And then the other ones is a completely dedicated team that we're calling like auto sets or imp calls or whatever you want to call them. Um, and this is where someone buys low ticket and they book in a call directly with a setter. Those are 15-minute Zoom calls. They do the call and then they get set with a closer if they're qualified. And those have insane stats. Okay. Now, the ones that I did not cover that are not easy to map out on here are going to be no shows and cancels. So, anything that falls off of this where they book, but then they uh no show or cancel even after they're confirmed or whatever, those also fire into a channel based on the HubSpot uh outcome of the deal or the deal stage more so and they're fired into there. So, that's kind of the gist of these no-shows, cancels. Went through all of these on the low ticket and the uh main VSSL funnel. Now, custom time request. This one I I'm trying to remember who stole it from, but on the booking page under the booking widget, you're going to have text that's going to say no times available that work for you. And it's going to be a link. And that link is going to either take them to another booking widget, which some people do, but I don't like that really that much because it the reason they didn't book in the first one is because they didn't find a time within the 48 hours, which is what we optimize for on the booking widget because that is the highest show rate that is just statistically shown. It's like, you know, 48 or 72 for some people. Some go out further. it feels like a crazy good product and offer and you're not doing as much volume like you can go out further because someone wants it so bad they're willing to book out and show later but for us with the volume we're doing it's always been 48 hours um as the booking window. So the link under there instead of being another calendar widget which we're talking about doing as a setter calendar widget but right now it's a form that they'll just say it'll basically just ask them when an exact time works for them and that as soon as that form is submitted it'll fire off to the setters. the setters try and reach them by phone or by text to make sure that this is a good time for them. Try and connect with them as early as possible and then set them with a closer. Okay, so these are big. Um you'll get I mean on our volume we'll get 10 of these a day depending on people who can't find a time or that time is either not available or it's further than the 48 hours. So they hit these and they get some good on that. Now how we are categorizing these in the CRM. So, inside the deal level, you are going to have the SDR owner or setter, whatever owner as a contact uh I'm sorry, as a uh as an owner property. So, you're going to have the contact owner or the deal owner in there as the sales rep. And then you're going to have another one that's going to be the SCR owner. Inside the STR owner, they're going to mark themselves only when they have claimed that person. Okay? So, important they mark themselves that. And then right under that, they're going to have a set source. This is going to allow you to be able to track depending on the source that they came from what the outcomes were. So you can pull reports, you can do all that kind of stuff on like if they came from this, this or this, what were the different ones? And that's what I'm about to show you. So for us, an auto set we are categorizing as these. So we auto set them a booking for 15 minutes and then they did a set. Now stats on that for auto booked to set is a 76% show rate and it was already over 76. Uh, and this is actually like a longer stretch of data when they were training, too. So, it's it's actually higher. Um, but 76 and an over a 20% live call close. Now, before everyone torches me for our live call close and all that, it is obviously something we are working on. If you've seen any of the other videos, I'm actively hiring a sales manager and we are like overhauling that whole team. I keep hearing that like 30% is the standard, but we had 25 20 25 as live call close the entire time we were doing like $3 million months, which just means it could have been four or five million, which is just crazy. We're stupid. I get it. We're here now. So 76% and 20%. Now self-set. We're going to define self-set as basically any of these that they're digging the CRM and finding these deals themselves to dial. So any of your app no books, any of your app no buys, any anything that is not auto set is basically only these auto calls. Selfs set is anything else, the custom time request, the whatever those dig CRM and set 61%. So obviously not as good. Now, what is also skewing this data right now is we're running DTA and testing it and this has a much much lower show rate. So, if we were just running our main VSSL funnel and our main low ticket funnel, we know the stats on that well enough. This is like brand new to be running. So, and having setters that are also ramping. So, this is kind of just like not fair data, but it is what it is. This is real. So for us right now we have 61% of them are showing and 12% live call close which still is like okay you know I mean it makes money but it's not like way in the green. So 61 and 12% on these breaks that out to what's the quick math on that 7% sales for booking. Can't do math live but that's okay. Confirm sets. Now, these ones are going to be your booking confirmation and your DQ booking confirmation, and they are going to be a 69 and a 14%. So, these stats right here, we've run triage is what we called them, the call center for a long time. And they were at peak 70ish%. And but their live call wasn't as good. And this is within four days of data or five days of data, I think, because we started on Thursday. Today's Tuesday. So, yeah, that's how we break them out. That's how we do it. And then if one is not uh set and then here's some ninja sauce for you. So the it's very common in the high ticket or like callfunnel space for if you don't confirm a call you mark it as free on the calendar which we've also never done which apparently is stupid but that's us. Um you mark it as free so that it can get double booked and then it makes it so the calendars can be tighter because the people who aren't confirming you're not like canceling their bookings for them because you paid for that marketing lead and all that but instead you're making this spot available so it can get double booked. If two people both show, the setter takes the one that didn't confirm, the closer takes that one, and then they handle it. Um, but with that being said, the we put in the CRM a mark as free and you can toggle it and it'll do all the API stuff on the background and like and push it in. So, it'll find the deal, it'll find it will take the deal, it'll find the contact, it'll run the contact, it'll find the deal uh I'm sorry, the event on the Google calendar and it'll mark it as free through that because it'll know who it's booked with. It'll know the customer, it'll know the sales rep from that section, be able to find that uh calendar event inside the admin of all the of our Google calendars and it'll be able to mark it as free. Why that's also nice is once something is marked as free, you know that it is not confirmed. So you can run your reports in inverse and being and you can say how many of these that were not confirmed, which is marked as free and don't have any of these categories set, what was their outcome? Did 10% show up or did 80% show up? Like we we don't know. I mean you're going to assume it's going to be low. So you have auto set, self set, confirm set, and non-confirmed all by owner. So then you can run it by person across each one of these and then have different commission rates for different things that are either more difficult or less difficult. Okay, combine them all. Someone gets a good commission depending on what bucket and how well they're doing in their role. Okay, little bit of sauce. We've never used them. I don't know why we didn't use them. We tried to use him and then we had our SDR manager working at another gig that he was exiting from and we paid him like a lump sum to bridge his income threshold because he was making call it 20 grand over here and he was going to start at 10 plus percentage or something let's just say and so we paid him like the bridge amount so he would make the amount on the way out and then like two or three months in after all this stuff we found out he never quit the other one and we just got railed so that's why we didn't do SCRs it's just we had a bad taste in our mouth but that was our bad so now we're Daily update. Made this doc www. needed that part. Ryan clog at/docck. I have all the videos I've made. Today's day 48. I'm sorry that this is rushed and cornered and whatever. I'm sitting wish I could show you my desk setup right now. Find it on X, but I have a magazine under the table and it's all shaking and whatever, but we're here and we're doing it. All right. We're at a marketing event and meeting some of the people for the first time in person that we've only ever digitally worked with or talked to. So, company update. Yesterday we did, let me look real quick so I don't lie for it. Yesterday was I believe not a good day. What was yesterday? Yesterday was Monday. Yesterday we did 81,000 uh which again in the right direction but like today is down not good. So we are have a very much so with the same lead volume and the same call volume. We very much so have a sales problem. Um so we have multiple sales managers we have now interviewed and I have another hundred in my DMs. Um, which is great. Like, it worked fantastic. I wanted to make these videos in order to be able to acquire talent and it worked. So, I got top dogs that I'm talking to that are specific to the industry, specific to the space, all the things. Um, and we have a good company that they want to work at that they've heard of before, which is really, really cool to hear and have like built together. So, we're excited. Um, but it's definitely the next domino to fall because as soon as we can increase these right here, these live calls, show rates are solid, right? But these live calls, when we get that up, it's game over. Um, well, it's just not game over. It's the beginning. But it'll be, you know, double the rate. If everyone's saying that 30% live call is the base, we're doing 14 right there is roughly double the units, right? Depending on how you want to look at it. Um, double the units, roughly double the cash. Um, and that'll put us in a really good place because then we'll be steady state over record months steadily. um with that piece in place and then everything will get marketing feedback because marketing can't scale right now without knowing the dollars that are coming back in the machine and we think that they're ineffectively coming back in as feedback. So we don't have signals. We can't scale into pockets because we don't know what they are because we only have half the units that we should be having coming through on qualified leads. So that's where we're at. Appreciate you guys as always. You've been giving me so much good learning things and support and all that in um the DMs uh on Instagram and on X. So, keep that up. I appreciate it. And I will talk soon. Comment on this one. Like on this one if you liked it. Sorry if I was late. Sorry if I am scattered.
