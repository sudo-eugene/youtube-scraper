In today's video, we're going to be talking about living life in phases to maximize momentum. We're going to go through balance and what that means to me at this age and stage. My phases that I've gone through in the last 10 years, knowing when to switch between phases, failure to replace, and I'll go pretty deep into this because it's a huge one. And then my current plan, where I'm at in what phase, and kind of where we're transitioning. All right, this is going to be very helpful for anyone who is in the weeds or kind of wondering what to do next. All right, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 78 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people. All right, so let's get into it. This is a bit of a different one, but I figure some of these are good to dance into here. So, balance. I kind of view it as like an 8020 situation. Um, I'm going to get into kind of like what my current plan is and where I'm at, but going to bounce all over the place on this, but 8020 truly and I I really think of things as like work or personal is kind of as simply put like I work it's probably like 955 honestly. Um, but what has happened was I what had happened was uh what happened on this for me was too much work and not enough personal uh has caused a lot of issues at times actually. And then same thing in the other way around. Like I'm I'm very extreme. Very extreme. Um so I've lived in this bucket and then completely given this part away. And then I've also looked at it as the other way around where it's just all personal, very little work. And we're going to get into that with like failure to replace and the downsides of when you decide to shift in that way. Um but what I think are really important is and just the more I talk to people who are in similar in the space or you know work online or just aggressive workers in general. um mixing in the trips, the locations, switching up the locations. Um so even continuing to live your life, work personal mix uh in different locations is a really good way to continue kind of getting momentum through the phase but not getting the burnout. Uh and then another one that I just want to throw on here that I found really good is events. Um sometimes they're actually like even more draining, but it's kind of a mix between the location and continuing to do the the work part. Balance is so tough because it's like it's really all what's your goal, right? And like what's your objective for you? Um, and I talk about that also a bit later in here, but it's like this all comes down to what you actually want as your goal. Because someone who is 22 and has XYZ, you know, targets is going to be a lot different than someone who's 42 and has XYZ targets or maybe the same depending. But like balance comes down to that and then what's important to you and what kind of like life you're trying to foster. Who already is included in your life? People have different situations that you start at. You I mean different people come from different worlds. Uh, so it's really important to understand like your goal of this. So, my phases that we'll walk through, like I said, very extreme. Um, so I did the college thing kind of and I was actually gonna make a whole video on this today, but I don't really want to talk about me that much on it. Um, but college really quickly dropped out and got into like a private equity style thing. So, we're essentially building a multi-unit franchiseor like rollup or franchisee rollup within a franchiseor. Um, got all this approval. I had I was like way in over my head. Um, I had two business partners in this, dropped out, moved and really started leaning into this. Spent nine months uh, putting everything together and then in the end deal fell through because of trailing Ibida just tanked and blah blah blah. But all to say this was like I didn't even know this existed. So like you see all these guys that are 18 in any of this stuff. You see all of them that are like 14 on X who are like doing all this stuff. I didn't know what any of that was until I was like 18 to 20. Um, and then all that exploded in my face. Went home with tail between my legs and started to learn this online. And so the service based thing here is where I started to learn online. So it was when I was buying courses when I was I literally I mean I remember my first online course I bought I had like $32 in my checking account on the end like I have a screenshot somewhere. I'll have to find it but it's just like so bad. Um and so I started doing service based stuff. So that was building websites. That was trying to find like basically be agency style stuff. I actually got into some hardware and was building like physical dashboarding units and stuff that I would put behind TVs like just some of that. Um and that's where I stumbled into the info. Uh I have another video talking about this, but essentially found uh the business partners I have now inside the paid community of an info product uh that I purchased and yeah um learned that then started running stuff for them, stopped doing any random web builds and all that kind of stuff kind of and leaned into this and this was just like you know 2K every six weeks or something random whenever cash was left over. We then scaled this pretty aggressively and got into info, really mainly info, coaching cash flow, but like really info. Um, and this was spitting out good cash. Like we're doing 10 million a year with solid margins because we were just selling info, so there's no fulfillment costs. And when I was in this kind of like dance dancing back and forth on this, like where I was at on these, this was like very personal, very little work. This was like kind of a 50-50 game. This was like all work, very little personal. this was very heavy personal and like partying and doing whatever. This was very very heavy personal um because at that point it was a lot of tech uh tech and systems and pieces of that and then now that I'm kind of like in this phase of info coaching like equity build and like massive so both cash flow and equity but like really it's this um it's now 95 work to personal. So the whole balance thing like I'm lighting things on fire right now that aren't Yeah. that are that are important to me um at some level and it's kind of like I I play that game in dance. So, knowing when to switch, um, you hear people talk about this, but like I'm saying phases. Other people say seasons, like you've heard these vid like videos. It's like skill stacking. It's uh seasons of life. It's all these other pieces, but like I'm just calling it phases. When you're burnt out, I don't really even know what this means or like directly feels like other than when my head is going to explode because I have 42 things going on. And really what that's kind of come back to for me is like the structure of it. And it's actually like the delegation and being able to kind of continue to grow up into the right. And burnout is more so I feel like when you're just stuck in the same place, which we kind of felt here at this, like in between these ranges, like where we've been at, we really haven't gotten a point. We haven't gotten to the point where it's like spitting out insane amounts of cash like it maybe kind of closer to was at this point. So like a lot of burnout um happens for a lot of people. Important things in life, this is a huge one. So shifting between this work and personal game of you don't want to miss out on important things. And there this die with zero concept. Um this is Bill Perkins book. It's a really good book that basically talks about there's things in life that were this is my paraphrasing but like there are things in life that you can only do at certain ages and stages. So like I didn't do the whole college thing when that was available and like you can't go back and do that. Like it's just not the same. Um you can't go back and like the example he uses is he's like I wakeboard a bunch right now or like I wish I would have younger because when I'm 65 and I have all the money in the world, my knees are probably blown out and I won't be able to do that. So like making time for important things in life. Same thing with like if you have family or your own children or whatever, like they're only that age. They only, you know, you have the impressions you have on them at that age. So like I don't have kids, but I have like nieces and nephews and like making it to their stuff and being available for that. Um and showing up in that way, I think is important. So I try and balance that. Um same thing with just, you know, relationships at certain times. Um, I don't want to get too much into that, but like, yeah, I've done a terrible job at times where it's like 99% work and I completely am like disregarding this and then when I think long term, it's like what am I doing versus having 10% that I allocate out and it sounds stupid to think of it like this, just how my brain works, but like to allocate that time out because I do enjoy it and I do want to spend time there, but it's like you're so hectic and you're like wrapped in all your stuff that you forget these things and that burns what could potentially be literally lifelong um or you know, 5 years, 10 years, 50 years of your life that you made a short-term decision to work an XYZ way or didn't have XYZ around it. So, um, another one's kind of like interest. So, when you quit doing something is that's a dangerous like kind of game because it's like not knowing. There's always there is a time to quit things, but it's not because you have shiny object syndrome and you're just trying to get over here and be interested in this thing over here or go over here. Like, you can follow interest. there are bigger opportunities, but do not shoot yourself in the foot by thinking that every shiny object is better than the current thing you're working on and you're jumping ship and quitting what you're working on. And like I was kind of in that phase like right here, I had all the courses I was on with uh Jeremy Haynes and I talked about it in here like I bought his course easily like just following frameworks, not easily. Uh there's a very simple model to get to hundreds of thousands of dollars a month as an agency um and multiple business models that I had bought around this time like uh courses and stuff around it. And only when I hit here did I actually like start implementing them and taking them serious and just stay in my lane that then we got the results we got. So it's like because I was interest hopping because I was going over here because I wasn't leaning into one thing. I never got the results. So like I switched up the phase in what I was doing way too early like way too early. Um so I never got to hit that momentum thing. But around here and then the last one on here is just like listening to yourself. there are people that are going to there there's a lot of loud opinions around you especially like in your life um in more personal side of life uh life and then obviously sometimes in business but like back to the original thing is like what is your goal of this who are you modeling off of and what are you basing your decisions on because if you're doing that in alignment with yourself and like what you actually believe to be true at this time you like can't go wrong right like you are going yes you're going to make mistakes yes you're going to be wrong about things that's okay but like As long as you make the decision and then follow through with it self-confidence wise, like it just feeds that self-confidence. It's like, I said I was going to do this, I did it. Even if it was a wrong decision, like looking back like, okay, now like why did I make the decision that way? Did I not have the right information? Did I do this? And like truly making that loop, I think is like very very important. Um the failure to replace on here I have been specifically right hereish. uh we were scaling into this and I was building all these crazy automations and it my life shifted like way heavy personal, way heavy party and travel and do all this stuff and very little work. Like I've never not been on Slack on a day, but like it's different than when you're like plugged behind a computer building and growing. Uh we kind of didn't have like a vision for what we wanted. It was just a cash flow business. So it kind of like in my mind and frame at that time didn't really matter as much. Um so yes, there were automations that were working. Um, but I was, you know, when I'm logged off, I come back and there's 42 things or I dropped the ball on something and the momentum started to die when it was going up because we were not all leaning in. Me specifically, I'm just going to speak for myself on this. Um, and that was huge. So, because yes, there were some automations, it like kept running, but the momentum died and there was not proper delegation. And that's something like to this day I'm working on where we don't have delegate. I I don't have as much delegation. I totally do now, like more so, um, in comparison to then. Um, but I'm just kind of to the point now where it's like the whole if you leave your business in a healthy way uh for 2 weeks and come back and it's operating and growing like up and to the right like that's where you want to get to. And I think that more so comes from culture and systems right so it's yes it's automations yes it's delegation but like having a proper culture having the right people and then having the right systems in place both completely automated in tech and also like people systems that it can thrive while you're gone. Um, so you can really be owner, not necessarily operator, I think is key. And that's kind of like where I'm trying to go in the direction I am. But like the amount of times in between these little buckets that I've pro I've had like momentum like this and then stepped away for X and then come back like this. Like I'm trying to remember who I think it was Becker had a video that was talking about like when people drink booze like as an individual, it's like you go like this and then it's like and you tank down and then it's like you go like this and then you tank down. It's like week over week and your momentum is never able to stack because of that. Now imagine that just like zoomed out and yes there's like partying involved but like just zoomed out in your focus and your direction like that happens so frequent where it's like and like you almost never give a get above that peak unless you give it time to stack on itself and get that momentum and I've seen that time and time again. So right now my current plan on this is I'm just full boore like I'm just fully in this like 8020 is probably not a fair uh you know if you did it by hours it's definitely not. Um but I need more delegation. I likely need an EA on the personal side. I'm doing so much better inside the business and other things I'm working on that I haven't yet said really. Um, but this is going really well. Like I'm having a really good time building this and with people and you're sacrificing some cash flow for some future value for sure because you're biting it now. But like the free time that allows it that then I pour back in that ideally is you know Dan Martell stolen quote but like to buy back your time that I'm hopefully using now in a higher leverage way uh I think is good. There's some EA stuff, but the more I do this, the more I just like handle all this personally. I've never hired anyone for anything personally, so like I think that's in the cards. Having structured personal trips is something I have never done and I've literally talked about for upwards of probably 10 years. So like quarterly used to be a big thing uh in online info whatever world that like people would take quarterly trips no matter what and just go, "Hey, I'm off for five days and just think and just think about what's going on here." Yes, you can check in. Yes, you can whatever. But you're not just behind the desk building. Um because I'm coming up on like pro um it's over a year now that this is all I've done. Um and then whatever it's been four months since I started publicly talking about it and posting it and like these charts are going to show that and you feel it 3 months, six months after because that momentum builds and builds and builds. Um so sometimes it's not as like you know immediate feedback loop like it is if you're maybe like media buying or something but uh yeah it's like it's happening now. So the events uh same thing is kind of up here. I have agreed to do a bunch of like go to events like I'm going to Jeremy's event uh in Miami next week. Um I went to Iman's event over in London. I think those are good little resets but still dance that like 8020 because the majority of the conversations work. But like you're making personal friends through work. I have a big rule that I usually follow that's like that actually have always followed and the only time it's burned me is when I've gone the opposite. But like business partners then friends, not friends then business partners. And I've followed that for a while. Um and the only times I haven't it's burned me. So, like I like these events cuz that's what it is. It's like you make friends through business, not the other way around. Um, and then yeah, aiming for this cash flow equity thing. We've been building this up. We've not been taking a lot of cash, like if any out of the setup because again, I've talked about the numbers and they haven't been fantastic uh because of the scale we got to in terms of like overhead and structure. So now we I might just be stupid and I might just be publicly being stupid, but like it's going to flip a switch. So it's going to go in this crazy direction and it's like right there. So I'm playing this cash flow equity game. I have multiple things I am in conversation with all within the same bucket. So, I'm not jumping interest. I'm not jumping pools of opportunities. Um, I'm staying in one lane and I think it's going to pay off really, really well. So, lean into this is kind of my plan right now. Get some more delegation so it's more ownership and decision- making and less operations and clicking keys. Um, but still obviously having a pulse within there. Um, structuring kind of the personal side of life to achieve the things I want to achieve personally at the same time as the businesses one. I'm definitely dancing the line of like you can you can have anything but not everything. And I'm kind of dancing that everything line. So trying to make sure where that I'm strategically sacrificing things that make sense to me and that I'm trying to think of them long term is like does this make sense to sacrifice right now for the future. Um but that's a constant kind of trade-off. Same thing with moving. Same thing with all these others. Like I'm just in it right now. Just like full in it. Uh and I need to reduce the videos. I need to reduce the videos down to two or three a week because I am definitely not burnout necessarily, but like it just takes so much time that I don't have time to it's like the it's the chaos of it. Like if I had them fully schedule scheduled out properly or I had like dayto-day if they were like podcast interviews or whatever every single day that would be amazing because then I would just be like boom cool I could pop on for this takes 20 minutes after to just like click the edit button do the thing export import done. uh or if I had someone on team to do that. But right now, because I don't have these in place, like someone to schedule them, someone to whatever, it takes too many hours for the back and forth, the communication, the social side of it, like the social media portion of it. It's just like too much. So, I think I likely am going to go down here soon. Um I don't even know what day I'm on. Probably 112, 13, something like that. Um but yeah, so that's the game plan. Um these kind of just turn into like vlogs at this point. Uh but I appreciate you guys. That's really what I got. If you watch these, you understand what the links are. Doc has all the videos on it. Info coaching is a survey that I'm just trying to collect for info coaching people. You don't have to fill out your contact info at the end. I'm just kind of curious at where people are at. And then Rolodex, you literally don't have to use any of these. I don't care. Um, but these are all things that may pay me or may not. I don't even know. I've never been paid from any of this. FYI, uh, still to this day, July 3rd, never been paid. FYI. Um, but yeah, I know some really good guys that do sales uh, agency. I'm a big believer in that info coaching businesses should outsource sales agency. Some marketing vendor guys, offer guys, uh credit card reward point things that are crazy that are 5 to 10% cash back uh when you spend on ads, data system stuff, all this stuff. So yeah, I have a bunch of connections for that. So just generally speaking, DM me on Instagram. You have to give me a bunch of contacts because I refuse to just like send these people's information um just because I know them as an individual. So yeah, that's what I got. Uh so hopefully this was helpful. All just to say kind of like my whole thing is trying to maximize this momentum. It sucks. I feel like I'm, you know, 28 right now and I feel like I could have done this at 21 and it's like you look back and you're like, "All right, it is what it is." And like comparison of, you know, these young guns doing it and I love it. Like I think it's so cool that these guys are doing it. I just like didn't even have the wherewithal to like understand that kind of stuff then. So shout out to them because I think that's very cool. Um, and we're just trying to, you know, hit these new levels within info coaching. Um, and you know, essentially hit exit velocity, but can't go back. Can't change things. can't stop being a freaking dumbass when I did, you know, 90% personal and was partying my face off and spending money left and right. Like, I can't go back and change it. I can only change what happened now. So, I have changed that up in my life over the last year or two um completely. So, now we're just leaning in and seeing what a couple years of uh direct essentially 955 work to uh personal pays off as. So, we shall see. I appreciate you guys. And drop some comments. I love the comments if you made it this far. This was kind of a drag one, but appreciate you. Toxin.
