In today's video, we're going to be talking ascensionbased info products. I had a few people reach out on Twitter talking about ideiation on low ticket offers into high ticket, the structuring of those offers. So, we are going to talk ascension models, the economics versus throughput of those models, cannibalization, not the bad kind, framing our plan, and some examples down here. I promise is simple. It just looks confusing. And then bonus, if you stick around to the end, we're going to go through churn and burn, how we look at this, and how we mitigate this. All right. Then, if you stay to the end, we're going to talk yesterday's stats. I do these videos every single day. So, we'll go through buyers, cash collected, Stripe, general company update. Last year, our women's fitness coaching business did 30 million in cash collected. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. All I ask is that you subscribe, comment some value that you got out of this, topic ideas, all that, and like the videos you like. All right, so let's get into it. Now, ascension models. This is super super common in internet marketing space, but you can you can use internet marketing in any industry. And I think that's important to highlight here because a lot of people just use this for the make money online niche or internet marketing for internet marketing. And I kind of want to show, you know, obviously we're a health example or a fitness example. Um, but there are a lot of different industries you can do this in. So, a lot of the core ones are going to be low ticket info into high ticket coaching. So that's the example of what we're doing. I have full videos on the channel where I break this down and I'll kind of go into it down below in the funnels. U but low ticket info into high ticket coaching, free community into paid community, right? So like that's a big thing in hormosi style with school and what they're going for there is a lot of people join have free school groups and then push them into paid communities from there. Mid-t info into high ticket info. So these are other there's a lot of different variations of this but example being a 2K auto webinar where someone is selling direct to a 2K webinar that someone purchases and then on the back end is either info or coaching and I'll break this down too but info or coaching on the back end. So you're selling something that's midt 1k 2k uh directly without having to talk to a sales rep and then selling high ticket info or coaching on the back end. And then the triedand-true consulting.com OG that launched a ton of these from whatever that was probably six, seven years ago was mid-t info either direct or through sales call. So a 1K to a 5k product call it then a high ticket ascension from there and then on the back end a mastermind. So like his example was um I think it was accelerator uplevel and quantum. It was like the OG version of this or probably not even the OG but the new age OG. Um, and he was, I believe it was 2K, then 5K, and then like 20 or 30K a year recurring, right? So, that's the old model. Then they obviously went and built school and have crushed it since then. Like, huge respect to those guys. Um, but yeah, so these are some of the core ascension models. Now, what I said earlier with ascension or internet marketing specific, a lot of people are just going to do this in this, but like I my mom's a vegan blogger, for example, and like she has a free community and we didn't launch a paid, but like there are so many people in the space that do that. They have a free community versus paid and it's all about like the differentiation and I'll go through that, but there are so many industries you can do this in and offer creation. Um there's a ton of good groups on this where they talk about it where everyone's doing this in in healthcare in landscape in like just the craziest industries you've ever thought about and applying this there is more so blue ocean than not okay because everyone else is competing over the make money online and like the new angle versus just taking one of these models that exists and putting it into an industry that doesn't have as much uh internet marketing competition. So economics versus throughput. When looking at ascension for low ticket specifically like this AOV versus Ascension or both, what I mean by this is you listen to Russell Brunson crushes it, Clickfunnels guys, right? All that like their whole a lot of their stuff, not all their only, but a lot of their stuff is all about having, you know, multiple Otto's inside of your funnel. So you're going to have your main thing you sell for 37. This works in ecom. This works in uh this works in every industry, but like direct to cart, for example. Um so you're going to run something to a $37 product. Then you're going to have an order bump. Then the next product is going to be 97. The next product is going to be $1.97. All as one-click upsells, onetime upsells, uh onetime offers, OTO, um throughout this process. And you're all you're trying to do is get that AOV up from the $37 it could be if you sold the main unit versus blend it out 30% take this one 20% take this one 20 10% take this one and it goes from 37 to 72 let's just say okay and sometimes a lot higher because people have like $500 and thousand courses on there payment plans recurring stuff like you can really play with this in economics Sultanic he has a group on uh Facebook called Nothing Held Back and they're like pros at this um so a lot of of the content is going to be you you can get a lot of the content out of there. But so AOV versus ascension and is basically me saying if ascension is your focus like it is for us in the model and if you watch our other videos where we are trying to take people from doing one action to the backend offer without with as little friction as possible. So in our example of this we're going to run them to a sales page. They're going to check out and purchase and then they're going to land on a booking page as the Otto instead of offering more things for them to sell because we are optimizing for ascension, not AOV. Okay? And what I mean by that is we are trying to get them in the back end, the highest percentage into the backend product from the front-end product. And we are trying to reduce the time to ascension by putting a call in right there. we're doing with the setter and then going to a closer from there instead of having them just buy the product, get into the community, and then eventually set them onto a call because we're trying to get the highest percentage of them onto a call and have that time zoomed in. Now, that is not to say that we cannot optimize our AOV as well, just not in the traditional way of just having like Otto after Otto where it's 97, 197 from there. So, what we're doing is stuff like order bumps, okay? And that'll be like they're already checking out. Then there's a checkbox below that's this in addition or that's basically in addition. So either like community recurring sometimes people do it. Those are a lot harder I think to frame them. Um, but just like a a recipe book or an added this, okay, cannibalization and how to look at this kind of goes with framing, but a lot of the again back to the anal sultanic thing like the it will be like a done do-it-yourself, a done with you, a done for you in these and that's kind of like this model right here or except mastermind in the back is implementation. So do it yourself just info product. someone logs in, they got to do the whole thing theirel. Done with you, generally speaking, like a group coaching. There is more support in it. And then done for you is like top dollar implementation. We build your entire funnel. We do this whole thing. And if these are too similar, like this one's easy because it's like the style of complete. It's like how someone is completing the service, right? It's like they're doing it themselves with or for. But a big issue with these in general is when they are too similar. They solve the back-end problem in some way and it creates cannibalization. So an example of this is we had that for a long time we sold an info product that was kind of mid-t. It was like a thousand bucks at the time and then we had high ticket on the back end. It was so much information and offered so much personalization both through the content and then through the group coaching that it was cannibalizing the backend product because the back end is onetoone coaching with personalization and all these things and community and whatever but there was so much overlap that it cannibalizes the other one. So you want to have different you like you want to differentiate between those two so that it makes sense for someone to go from here to here or they see the value is probably a better way to say it in the next stage uh of the business or of the of your offers. So some framing on this. My CMO opened my mind to this. There are tons of people who talk way more about this and better like we're just now running this. We have run it in the past but like we're just now running this again. So we're we're iterating on this real time. So this is raw but framing for the continuation of the offer stack and you know they call it like offer stacking they call it um ascension like your ascension stack but more quicker easier than the next natural steps. So more of the same and this works in ecom. You see a lot of guys talk about this. It's like oh cool someone just bought your duck product. It's like next upsell is do you want three of them? Do you want another one for 50% off? Like more of the same. Quicker. How do they get the result quicker? So, um, an example of that is like they buy a info product or a course on how to do this and then there's an o there's either an Otto or an order bump as the next thing that's a quicker way to do it and it's like or do you want just like this three-step way to do it instead of like this big info product that you just bought that yeah, you're going to learn it but it's going to take longer. It's like this is the shortcut. So, it's like people buy those and then easier similar to quicker but like an easier way to do it um is is also very common. So next natural is the main thing that people think about but like this is more of the same or staying within the same messaging alignment. So an example of that is like if you're doing nutrition and exercise as like your core thing right within fitness it's like if you're selling something that's nutritionbased okay they want something more they want quicker they want easier. Yes. The next natural inclination from there in this example would be fitness. Okay. So it's like juice as much you can around the nutrition. Then you're going to the next which is is exercise. It's like the next step. So an example of that like in landscape is someone gets a uh you know backyard renovation or whatever they get a pool. It's like the next thing they want is the landscaping around the pool, right? They like come with it. It's cross cells. It's upsells. And there are so many videos about this. So I'm just sharing like our our frame of this. But so much stuff on YouTube, so many good groups where people only do this specifically. Um, and there are people in those groups that'll do it for like not that crazy expensive. Five grand, 10 grand plus a percentage of it. A lot of them are built around percentage of the upside, but it's like who cares if that's a percentage of the upside as long as your math maths like keep on doing it. Um, we had somebody offer like 10 20k without a percentage I believe and then a percentage plus this for like five or 10k. Um, so yeah, you can get these built for you where these people will go through this entire thought process and just like handle it. Um, so if you already have something going like that's a good play or you can just learn it in those groups. So our plan and examples, we base ours off of like buyer personas slash like interests. So messaging. So the pockets of messaging, an example for us is something like um menopause, macronutrients, uh, mindset, muscle, right? So like those are just four examples. But like again, I'm not the messaging guy. I have an understanding of this and I wanted to launch this and because I understand the economics and the business but to be the person writing the messaging is not to me okay or running the ads. So, pockets of messaging for that example, you're gonna have messaging, you're gonna have an offer, and you're gonna have continuity across those. And then you're gonna have pods. And what I mean by that is this funnel right here, for example, is going to be all macronutrient-based or in a bigger health thing. It's like this is going to be thyroid based or this is going to be um, you know, cleanse or something. You know what I mean? Like you have different messaging pockets that can land and each one of them can individually be scaled up. Now, caution. You don't need three of these to get to a million a month. You need one of these to get to a million a month. You may need multiple of them depending on market size, messaging, all those things. You may be able to get one to three million a month and then need another one to do that. And we pushed ours so hard on our current or our main one that we were just like, keep going, keep going instead of doing multiple. And I think that was a critical mistake. And as you'll see, our acquisition has broken. And we are that's what we're actively still trying to fix. And the future is this. Okay, so pockets of messaging offer continuity pods. Say this is macronutrients. Okay, you're going to have a VSSL funnel. It's going to go through. Our CMO said this the other day. Guy's a genius. Sparks my brain every day. But he was basically saying that you're going to run the VSSL funnel, but you're also going to run the low ticket because the VSSL funnel is people who are already framed. And as long as you have or I'm sorry, not already framed, but there is a portion of them and call it 3% of them I think was his number he used that are already like ready to buy or like in the position to buy both where they are like mentally and like where like their understanding of the problem where they are with themselves. They're already ready to book a call and buy. And then the other ones and where a majority of them would want to come we should want them to come from is going to be through low ticket. And that is both for the economics as well as the framing because the economics get way better. I have other videos about this, but assuming you get it cost you a h 100red bucks to get a $50 purchase uh of your low ticket $50 net AOV or I'm sorry net CPA on that. So cost you 100 bucks, you already made back 50. Now it only you so you burn 50 bucks but that 50 4% of those buy the back end and you flip that on its head and you are in a good CPA range for high ticket um and it's just mass volume and this is like again a time to ascension thing but whatever. So pockets of messaging ascension greater than AOV for us that is our goal. We are going to do things that will increase the AOV but not distract from this funnel. So, right now we're talking only about adding things like order bumps onto here because we don't want to have, oh, and buy this for 97 and this for 297 and whatever at this time because our goal is to get a lot of people on the phone with a setter and then have the setter set with a closer. Okay. Now, what I mean by continuity with pods over time, we've heard about this, we have not done this yet because we haven't had to because we're only running basically one of these right now. Um, you would have a setter call. you'd have setter pods that are dedicated to the different ones because they would be coming in under this detox offer or they would be coming in under this messaging pocket. So having continuity of VSSL they're seeing let's say around this messaging the low ticket they're seeing around this messaging and offer then getting on with a setter that is you know either titled whatever the call name is whatever and they know that the person bought this product which is easy enough to do but like just framing that way so you have dedicated people that are really good at this and then those set with the same sales team that's all one backend and this is where it all comes and connects back is with one sales team we've heard this is okay to do we may have to have multiple sales pods I don't believe so. Um I mean you'll have sales pods because you have so many sales reps but I don't know if they'll be dedicated to different uh inflows. Then from there they buy and then it's the same backend purchase. They're buying the same backend because it is what solves their problem and it is the, you know, the creme de creme on the back. And know your numbers because it's huge because if you don't know your ascension rates on these, you don't know your CPA on these, you don't know your time to ascension, like you could it could flip and you could be in a bad situation. uh if the time two is too long and you have this massive tra uh trough of ad costs, if you're scaling into it so heavy that you don't know your time two or your ascension rate accurately. Um this is stuff we're actively dealing with by the way. So like we're running this and we are getting good stats but it's like how hard can we scale it? Um but we also need to scale it because we want to generate the bookings but we know that only 25% pop out this range. Like these are things you need to know and track. And then quick bonus turn and burn. Someone asked here like how do you sell high ticket coaching without the churn and burn? I have a sticky note on my desk that says everyone is someone because I'm so technical sometimes that I forget that when I'm looking at split tests and purchases and all the stuff that come through is that's literally a person. Um and you need to think about it that way especially when it comes to this stuff. So natural inclination in education and info meaning talks about this in a video recently but basically the natural inclination in educ education info is for someone to leave once they learn the thing right so it's like someone pays whatever for four years of college to get the education to take the classes after they're done they don't continue to pay for college so why would they continue to pay you right for your high ticket coaching so another example of this is within fitness it's very common that if someone gets the results or they don't get the results, they leave, right? So, if they don't get the results, they just are like, "Oh, this didn't work." Even very, very likely that means they didn't do the thing. So, they'll leave. And the people who do get results a lot of the time have learned how to do it throughout a year of coaching or at least learned the the fundamentals on how to get the results on their own. Okay? So, they'll leave. Now, why would they stay? That's the biggest thing. We forever have just offered on the back end of our product just the same thing. And like we do have retention like for sure and we do these internal blasts that are uh disc we do twice a year like 1k off blast to the current team uh I'm sorry to the current current client base um and incentivize the coaches to that where they basically if their people do it they get like a percentage commission on the back end. Um so that's a big one to get people to stay but again they have to want to stay already. So currently our offering has always just been more of the same right this whole thing is just more of the same. it's just another year and currently we're building out a backend that is based around this why would they stay. So a slight price decrease and then really focused around the reasons they would stay and what they value the most after a year after they get to this next phase which is the community which is yes personalization but they don't need it as much one-on-one. Um it is the education and like continuous stuff because we'll do like guest speakers that come in. will do um just like groupled things. Um so yeah, there's a bunch of things within this but this is the question I ask. Why would they stay? So there's a lot of like info marketing ones and it's like that people are in masterminds and a lot of the time it's like why would they stay is like finger on the pulse new things coming out and community for example. So like new thing in marketing, oh someone did this and then also the people in it you're just like you become friends with and you want to stay in. Um, there's a really big one guy who crushes it, Ezra, who does it in uh, ecom, blue ribbon mastermind, and he has like just such a tight-knit community and also runs these big e-commerce businesses that then shares real time like what we're doing now. And it's a perfect example of that. So, it's like what's working now, how we're scaling, what we're looking at this at. Oh, here's this crazy new tool we found for email or using AI. And also like he has like banded brotherhood of people who are in that group that are all like just really solid good people that all hang out and then they have events that are throughout. So tactical part of that um activation points so that's both on the front and the back and then having dedicated retention team. Uh we are testing that right now. We've seen a big uptick in at least like the soft metrics of it. Um and then like I said changing out offers too and having just really getting clear on why they would stay. So, I hope this answered the ideation of creating low ticket into high ticket turn and burn structuring. I didn't really super go into this, so maybe I count on another one. Um, I'm more of a funnel percent math structure type of person, so uh, this one was a little bit easier for me. But yesterday stats, terrible. I I like again I always say this, but like I love and hate that I'm making these videos right now. We had three low ticket buyers yesterday. This is crazy for us. So like we are so struggling on this part. This is a time two part but this is just like breaking for us and honestly what's actually breaking is like this sales process because like we'll fill calendars and then it won't close and then we'll half fill calendars and they'll close eight units and it's like what is going on? So it's this it's this connection between marketing and sales and the consistency around it that we are struggling with because it's not good. This is what 1.2 1.5 something a month like we can't do that. That is not good for us. Um, so yeah, 47 GS yesterday, which is basically the same as the day before, which is not good. But today on Cal, we have whatund and something calls, which is a big uptick. So, we will see where it shakes out. As always, Twitter's popping off right now. I didn't even realize. Might be my second favorite behind YouTube now. Um, but yeah, subscribe, comment some topic ideas where you got value out of this, like it if you like it, leave it alone if you don't. Those dislikes hurt my soul. Uh and yeah, talk soon.
