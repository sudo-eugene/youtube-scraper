what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to show you the exact steps on how to set up a sales team open spot reader All right so why that's important is so you can see 30 days in advance how much availability is on your sales team's calendar is the exact setup we used when we had five sales reps all the way up to 30 sales reps and did 30 million in cash collected last year and this is how marketing can adjust spends depending for a call funnel right so depending if they have 50 or 150 open spots marketing needs to be able to generate those bookings so they need to know how many and how many in advance all right so I'm go through this this is ours I finally figured out a way so I hid our personal info up here so first things first you're going to have a spreadsheet uh a Google sheet that is going to log the date it's going to go 30 days in advance every day and then the First Column is going to be the summary or the sum more so of all of the sales team members so I hid that up here because I just don't want to give away their personal emails and all that um but essentially it will log their emails along here and how many open spots they have across these date ranges okay so this is the actual one that we have used and are actively using so today being March 21st we have 12 open spots and this is not going to show you how many bookings they have just how many open spots we have all right and it kind of does these weird bug things but this always works out to be correct if you actually go and count them all right so first things first you're going to have Google sheet next you're going to have a Google Calendar that is specifically dedicated to managing the sales team right so for us let's call it sales comp.com and what you're going to do and I don't want to open up the calendar because I don't want to give away customer info but on your Google calendar you are going to go in the bottom left and you're going to subscribe to all of your sales reps and this is dedicated just for this if you have subscriptions to anything else it'll count and it'll be wrong okay so you're going to have a sales at whatever company name you're going to go into your Google calendar and you're going to subscribe to all of these different ones okay next what it's going to be able to do is based on so if you click on day view you can see two reps or 20 reps or however many and you'll you with your like just visualizing it will be able to see okay cool there's 30 minute blocks here hours and like rough estimate or you have to count them all issue with that is it's live changing there's availability changes there's people who block all day there is weekend uh volatility in terms of availability all these pieces so what you need to be able to do is forecast that because the marketing team needs to know x amount of days in advance not uh just tomorrow is 70 in the day after is 180 and like you can't have that so you need to try and keep uh consistency there so your spends can stay consistent so what you're going to do is start up a new spreadsheet once you have subscribe to all of them okay and then you're going to go into extensions and you're going to create an app script all right so I'm going to grab the current one that we use and it'll create this little cool calendar automation so I'm going to drop this to you guys and have it somewhere you can just comment if you want it and I'll send it to you because I don't know if I want to publicly post it but but this is essentially the script okay so what it's doing it's creating calendar automation for us the start times this is all an Eastern for us and it's where the account is so for us it's 6:00 a.m. and uh midnight so 6 a.m. to midnight is when we take calls 30 days in advance and then intervals for us we had to do some custom thing so you could actually like just drop this in GPT and get it Rewritten so it doesn't have this like before May after but it doesn't matter um and then you're just going to change these to the block so 30 meaning 30 minutes so for us the sales calls are 30 minutes long if they're 60 minutes if they're 45 you just change them and just change both these it's a little bit of a duct tape solution but it'll work and it doesn't matter um so yeah so right here you can see like we we custom built this a little bit but you can just pass this into GPT and have to do what you want all right and then you're going to go here all right you are going to save that project and you are going to run it right so all we just did is connect this sheet to this script it's going to ask you to review permissions I'm going to pause this and review and just accept you are going to click select all and then just approve it which is what I just did and then the next piece is you're going to want to come in here and create a trigger and you're going to add a trigger that is head that is time driven and then however often an hour fine you can do minutes uh yeah yeah wait minutes and then every 15 is generally best just cuz if you have like sales teams if you're onboarding or offboarding all that CES going to save that it is going to ask you to review configurations again and then you're just going to approve it same exact way we're going to go back to this you can run it all right so now what is happening um so I'm just going to pause on and off because I don't want to give away again customer info or uh team info so what is now happening once you begin running this you set the automation you set the trigger um and it is processing in your spreadsheet so if you go back to your spreadsheet you'll see in the bottom right corner it's going to be like C calendar automation running for sales rep email calendar automation running for sales rep email and what it's doing is it's pulling from your goo calendar in order of the people that you subscribe to excuse me um and showing it's reading their calendar from those time ranges and finding anywhere that they're in this case a 30-minute block and it's counting that as an open spot okay so it's logging all of those and it's doing that 30 days in ADV uh out 30 days okay so I'm going to pause this and then go back to that sheet once it's complete all righty so now I just came back to our sheet and what you're going to see is if you do a hard refresh you're going to have this calendar automation here and you can create that trigger as well here instead of custom making it I forgot about that so you can just click create trigger it'll go through the same process of uh asking you to review the permissions and create it so I would do it right there as well so if you go create trigger running script you sure you want to create this yes and then the script has been finished the trigger's been created all right so now that's going to happen so it's going to look like this and then I just deleted all the sales teams info out of here so I could show you so it'll be total which is the real number you want and then it'll be Buy sales rep so this is a quick way to audit to see if that's correct because like a lot of times sales rep will put things as busy or free or have a full day block somewhere on accident or stuff like that and here you'll see uh you'll see zero you'll see like not available and they should have it available so this is also like a nice little double checker for sales manager sales Ops to be able to check but here you'll be able to see it just pulled 30 days out and now every 15 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever that said uh it is going to pull and update this information for you all right so now live updating here across by sales rep and what you have is you have the date and you have the open spots okay and that's it now it's done now how do you make this functional even more so is you give this to Marketing in a clean way that's easy for them to use all right so what I'm going to do let pop back to our call tracker that I have in another video super super simple call funnel tracker um but this piece this open spots piece is what we're going to have live updating connecting to the other live updating sheet all right so what you're going to do is you're going to go into your spot section and you are going to essentially do an import range function I don't want to give the so you're to do an import range where you're going to put the spreadsheet URL of the uh new call Tracker so you're going to grab this spreadsheet URL all right and then so it's called calendar summary on here because this is like what it autogenerated and created so you're going to come into here you are going to go whatever xyz.com whatever or you know whatever Google spreadsheet link and I'm going to put ours in and then pause it but and then you're going to go the uh range string which is going to be calendar summar and then it's going to be you want in this example you want want this is where you want to start so you'd want A2 to B so you'd want A2 to B just like that and you close this out all right so I'm going to pause this and put our actual one in there all righty so there you go so now it what it's going to have is inside A2 you just put that import range function and it's going to be pulling from this and it's just going to be grabbing this section right here okay so you technically do it from A1 just do this whole block because here we already had the header on here that said date in open spot so I'm just leaving it um but essentially you could just pull either so all you want is the date that's live updating as well and then the amounts which are really live updating now when you pop back into your summary and what are we on right now 321 you pull these out for how many spots oops I don't even have it plugged in there and it will live update on this sheet so now marketing can actively see this you can send this into the dashboard or as a dashboard into your marketing channel you can just have this they always have it open more or less and every 15 minutes is going to adjust and show and why is like super important is because okay if you look across this range we have you know 116 112 so like ours are pretty consistent right now as you go across but what happens when you have four sales reps that get fired or whatever are terminated and then you have 17 new ones starting and like you know I mean like you have all these constant changes and they need to know or if you have a 3-day thing where a bunch of people are at conference together and like there's this low you don't want to change Facebook spends obviously like that aggressively but it's always good to know what the target is so like with this target if your goal is 80% booked right here I just like quick by eye I see you know 115 so you want 115 times 08 so you want 92 call it and then just whatever round up you want 100 bookings and right now if you look at your cost per booking across ranges and you know that it's 200 and I said whatever I said let's call it 110 so you want 110 I think I said yeah I said 100 and then if you know it's cost per of on average of 200 like your team should be targeting 200 or I'm sorry 20,000 in spend if your numbers are consistent you know it's around 200 per booking you want to fill 80% you want to like hit these numbers because you have cancels and no shows and reschedules so this just gives you eyes is the most important thing here on where this is and actively changing 30 30 days in advance so this is a little hack we used when we had I think five reps we kind of started to run into this and we're like oh this could be an issue and then we use this exact same system still in a sheet actually um we like put it into looker and all these other view like places but this is still the way that we actively manage uh for marketing to be able to see this up to 30 something sales reps so little more tactical um if you guys have any questions uh if you want this exact script and all this kind of stuff just DM me on Instagram I'll have the link below in this but yeah I just don't want to publicly post it so just DM me and I'll send it over so talk soon
