In today's video, I'm going to go through how we compensate our team of over 100 employees all the way from the sea level down to the boots on the ground doing the role. All right, so last year we did 30 million in cash collected in 2024. And all this entire channel is just me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All right, and I do this so I can attract top talent, opportunities, and build a network. So let's get into it. So first thing, uh, all these purple boxes right here are essentially people who are KPI performance driven. Okay, so everyone's going to have a base of what KPIs they need to be doing like are they doing a good job but the purple ones are where it is connected to their comp. Okay, and even when building this I was like I need to do this in more places and I'll go into that. Um but just starting over here in marketing division. So we have our CMO who is a new role for us. Um so far we've actually always run that internal to us. So CEO uh and co-founder was always running marketing. Um, but for almost all of these and this one included, it's going to be a base that's like a pretty healthy base and then directly KPI to for us it's the net CPA of our main product. So like our main backend offering. So I have other videos about this, but um, basically we're now testing low ticket and ascension models. So there's going to be blended CPAs and all that. And what we really really care about is what is the net CPA of that back-end product. So call it um 3,2500 2,000 and 1500 CPA. And at those different levels, they get a higher percentage as a bonus. So, say they make 100 grand a year. And I don't want to use exact numbers because that's not really fair to these people to do. Um, but I'm more than happy to kind of go into exacts of the actual model, but not the actual numbers. So, let's say it's 100K as a salary. Then when they hit the first threshold, they'll get 20% as a bonus. And we do that out in a monthly basis. So, we do that across all these for our KPI driven uh for the bonuses or for the uh additional compensation. So, let's say it's 10K a month. So they're going to get that no matter what. Then we're going to say 20% additional will come if they hit this threshold. They'll get 40% additional. They'll get 60% additional 80 all the way up until they can make almost like double their salary. Um and for us this model works out well because the company is then still uh making more money per unit. And really structuring these like the biggest thing here is structuring it so that the bonuses are truly bonuses. So the company is making more no matter what. And it's like a win-win situation. The person makes more and we make more as a company. Never in a situation where the KPI could drive it. So, we actually make less profit. All right. Um, graphic designer. This is like a per unit basis. So, oops, I didn't even throw a little arrow in here. Um, so this one is going to be for uh like a perunit base. This is a base that actually climbs. So, it's really variable on how much you spend. It's not fixed for this uh specific one. We've had media buyers in the past or agencies more so that were like 10 to 13% of actual spend. So, like we've paid a million in ads in a month and paid out like 130k in agency fees and now we're completely internal. But like these can get wonky if they're tied to ad spend and they really should be uh CPA driven because in that example our CPA got whack and it didn't even uh we were losing money and paying out more which is not cool. So Google media buyer is a fixed fee that does climb as we go. um not too aggressively, but just knowing that like when we spend let's say 50% of our spend, this will increase from call it 4K or 8K to 10K. Like it's a 20 to 30% lift. Um this is a twoerson team. Um and theirs has climbed too as the spend has climbed because right now we're spending like 30-ishk a day. Um copywriter, this is an OG for our company and has been there when we were just doing like random needed one-off stuff to now he writes two a day emails, all of our copy, all of our stuff. This is again just a flat one that has climbed over time and kind of stays. So all these ones that are just like this are essentially like projectbased work and normal salaried roles that will climb with continued uh proper stuff. So they all do have KPIs. It's just their comp isn't directly tied to it. So like this one for example, creative director fully leads all of our organic and it does make sense to figure out a way to tie them to that. we just haven't yet and like that's on me and that is something we've identified and like me making this chart even is extremely helpful to me to be like yeah this one definitely can be this one kind of can be these definitely can be um so stuff like that where there's huge opportunity and none of this is me saying this is the right way to do it this is just how we currently have it set up and have um so over to here CTO COO I don't know this is me I don't know you want to call it but I hate titles I really hate titles so I don't even know why we have all these but people like them so um mine here is variable directed on profit as owner equity, right? Um same with the CEO up here, senior tech lead. This is an interesting one and I need to figure out a good way because this is like my department um in some way, shape or form. right now it's a healthy salary and then when there's like cool big projects that we can directly identify that made a lift whether that's in efficiency and so savings or a lift in things like uh more revenue like the app not book sequence um increase more bookings that we have given random bonuses and one-offs which I believe is very helpful but it's like inconsistent and I don't like that I don't think it's fair for the person fully um but there's a rockstar on our team and it's continuing to take more role and as that role climbs I think that this needs to be in a pocket of a way to earn like a profit share pool. So, we'll see how this evolves over time. This flat fee, that's monthly. All right. Now, into sales. So, currently our closer manager is really our sales director, but only manages the closer. So, this is kind of like a little future state of a model, but this is the same person. And then this is a brand new person for us, set of manager, and I'm kind of like leading at some level right now just because a lot of it's technical and operational to get it all off the ground. And then from there, they're a super strong leader, so they'll be able to run their whole own thing. Um that's why the arrows are here. So these two are both going to be flat and this is what market is right now of March of 2025. So market is a healthy base again. So call it 8 to 12k depending on your person who knows. Um and then heavily on performance. So performance for this being their department new revenue. So like a setter manager would make a percentage of revenue on the new revenue generated which for us is we consider in the first 30 days of so call it 1% 2% like people do different numbers but it could be 1% of uh all new revenue generated. So if there's a million dollars that's collected then they'll get a 10k a million across the month in cash collected that's new that comes from setters they would get 10k right? So you have to bake this in your whole overall models but this seems to be pretty on par. A big thing to think about and something that we ran into is when we get too big or not too big, but like as you scale, some of these can get like crazy uh crazy high. And I've heard people talk about this before and other big owners when we're at like masterminds and stuff that talk about how their C level doesn't really get above like the 3400 range. Um which is interesting. So we have our team got paid really well last year when we did um 30 million like really well. So some of this has tweaked a little but a majority has stayed in place just because these are the team that we had. So that's their setup. Setters. Same thing. It's going to be a low base. Um, this one, these for us are W2. These are 1099 just because they're completely different roles and they have different churn and they have different responsibilities. So, you're allowed to segment those out. Um, but for us, this is a low base and then a percentage of set. So, we have these split out into two. So, we have auto set versus self-s set. So, auto set is something that we're going to direct book with them through marketing. So, after someone buys low ticket, they autobook into a call for an implementation call. That's an auto booking. And we can do 30 of those a day right now while testing or 15 to 20 of those a day is more accurate. But um those are a lower percentage than the higher percentage which is if they mine the CRM, they make a 100 dials, they get someone on the calendar with a closer and then they close. That's more effort, more work. Uh and for us, that's how we're currently structuring it. I'll see if this sticks. We might just go to one flat fee that's kind of blended, but uh in current state, that's how it is. And then closers, I made a whole another video on this on how we pay closers. So it's different um percentages based on kind of like their uh performance seniority. So like where they at over where they're at over a trending amount of range. Uh basically like if you're in the top tier you make 10% 9% 8% and then all of them are W2. So they make 44 45K a year and benefits and uh and all the stuff. So sales ops manager is essentially someone who's like in here doing a lot of the admin level detail managing in that way. Um and this one is same thing. So like a salary that will that climbs based on performance and company growth. Um, but right now we're stagnant slash down. And because of that, like a lot of these roles aren't growing because they don't have direct KPIs that drive revenue that don't that drive efficiency that you can track. And like that's on me to figure out. And a reason I put this together was because I want to figure out how to compensate everyone based on KPIs that are only upside for the company and only upside for them. So where can they control a KPI that they can get bonused on that isn't going to hurt that is part of the growth. If they make the company another million bucks, they get 50K of it or whatever the numbers are. Um but we need to figure that out at a better way to compensate the team because we got fat and happy no doubt. So chief of people this is another um equitable profit uh profit share position. Um so this one is overarching to the entire company and their department CS manager salaried role. Um these all across basically bases bases oops didn't mean to put that arrow. bases, bases. Um, these right here have uh a communication like bonus pool where if there's refund rates, if there's refunds that come in or escalation is what we call them, and they save them. So, if they keep the refund rate down, they have a bonus pool. So, it's based on a percentage of refund rate because we do like pretty liberally refund if it's within that first like 7-day batch of people who signed and they get buyer remorse or get rebuild on accident. Like, there's all this kind of stuff that happens. So, to keep that refund rate down, we do have a bonus pool for these guys, but it could be better. Um, and then quick jump real quick, but this person, this person, and then this entire layer right here are all on the operations team for us. And in my opinion, we need to come up with a better way to kind of like group comp them or come up with like a profit share that's specific to their department. And I haven't done that yet. So, that's something that I want to work on and put in place, but we haven't done. Um, coaches, these are the premieres. They're basically lead coaches. because they have clients, but they also are like pod leaders is what a lot of the time you call it in sales. So, we're doing the same thing in fulfillment. Um, they make their coach amount and then they also just make an x amount flat fee that's an additional to manage um or in addition to manage, I'm sorry. Um, coaches, this one is one a lot of people ask about, but for us it is based on volume of clients. So, everyone comes in, these are all W2 positions, by the way, almost everyone. Marketing is the couple that are 1099, but everyone else is uh a W2 employee. Um the coach for us the levels are rough numbers but call it like 55 65 75 in those ranges. You hit different salary tiers as you increase your client load. Right? So this is kind of like more or less putting them at a not a cap but like a high end of where we've seen in the past the fulfillment starts to slip and they start to get like less high quality reviews, clients feel like they're too spread out, all that. So we kind of have a a cap in place. Um, but yeah, it incentivizes them to climb and have more clients, which is then easier for us. I mean, same thing as a sales rep or a marketing channel or whatever. It's like if you already have someone on the team that can take more volume, it's better than having to get another coach, go through that process, weed out, one's good, one's not, or whatever, 10% of them stay, whatever the math is, um, it's way better to keep one and have them have more volume and be part of the team. So, we have a ton of super like rockstar coaches. You can see them on the website. Um, but they get paid well across here for us bringing all the clients to them, hosting the platform, doing all those things and they get to work just one-on-one with the client and it's obviously like a heavy workload. Um, but they get to work and just do the part that they like and we do the stuff around them. So, HR manager, same thing, salaried style. Talent experience manager. I didn't have this on the last org chart, but um, this is somebody who handles all the onboarding pieces there. also a rockstar and gets paid um basically that same structure. Oops, I don't know how that happened. And then retention management. This is another new one. And then I'll stop yapping, but retention management is somebody who is in charge of keeping people into the second and third year. So essentially when someone is 60 days out, um they get notified, they book a call with them, um they see where they're at in their journey, how's the first year been, and then basically positions them into a sale for the second year. So, these are all um sales reps that were I'm sorry, they were sales reps and there's two of them right now that uh then were sales managers and then came over into retention management. It's a new division. We don't have any math yet on it on like what works or what doesn't, but we're going to come up with a secondary offer they can do for almost like a downell continuity for the second year. And they get paid commission as well. So, it's commission of what they renew, which for us in the past has been in the coach's hands and they just kind of want to coach, they don't want to sell. And so, we're trying to change the frame of that. But these ones are all making a variable performancedriven piece. Okay. Sales director there, there. And all these other ones are currently making relatively flat amounts. Let me know in comments if you want like breakdowns of actual specifics of these. I don't again I don't want to give out like direct people's incomes, but ranges are pretty obvious across these. Um, and yeah, I think it's way more important to move in the direction of having more and more purple boxes, and that's what I'm going start to work on as we get into like Q3. Right now, it's not important to us to necessarily change these. There's some in here that I can change that would could potentially change behavior, and as long as they're mapped correctly, it wouldn't be an increase in whatever, but right now, it's the goal is to avoid confusion. Not not incentivize people, but not confuse people with harder ones. So unless we can come up with clean metrics on a way to have sales ops manager make more money in that way because they do this or tech to do it in a way that isn't just more confusing and driving the wrong behavior. And I want to make sure that these are clear cut before we roll them out to teams. So little bit of an exhaustive one but I hear that's what you guys like. So let me know if you have any comments.
