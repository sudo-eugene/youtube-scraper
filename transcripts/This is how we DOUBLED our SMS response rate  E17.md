in today's video I'm going to go through why we are moving over to send blue bubbles instead of green bubbles I'll show you quick stats on some tests we just ran that are insane results uh pockets of traffic that we're looking to apply this in and some limitations I see we last year we did 30 million cash collected and this entire channel is me just sharing what we did do what did work what did not work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all with the goal of attracting top talent opportunities and building a solid Network all right so let's get into it so first thing the test we just ran was a 10-day period so it's Mar 2025 right now so the last 10 days of the month basically um and the pocket I'm calling it pocket but like the lane that we applied it to was app notebook so for us when people come in they uh opt in so first name email we don't get the phone number and then application after they watch the vssl which is like 16 questions one of which is phone number then they book then they talk to a sales rep then they buy okay so for us the app no book is about 50% of the applications so you'll get 200 applications in a day 100 of them will book a call with the sales rep and those other 100 go into a lull of where they don't so we have email and SMS and all these things and in current state we send them as green bubbles right so we use SMS that is I don't want to use the service provider we use but just one of the normal ones that direct connects to HubSpot and it sends green bubbles uh and this is an AI bot and I actually have another video on the channel where I talk about this but essentially ingests their application information and then asks them questions and sends them resources based on what their application said so for us we've run this for like a year and we have on average a 2 4% response rate so all we did was swap out like the conduit so we changed it to Blue to Blue sending uh which right looks like IM message and it'll send uh as blue messages versus green messages left everything the same so the AI is the same the questions are the same the context is the same all it is is just a different sending mechanism and for us we went from 24 to 50% response rate so like not even tweaking the prompting or the messaging or the trying to get anything the CTA rate went from 6.5 to 14 so how we track that is basically when it asks them to book a call when it sends them the link so this means that more people are responding to the initial message this means more people are having more conversations that get to a point of uh getting the CTA right because like response is one thing but then continuing the messaging because the CTA goes off depending on the conversation the AI will send it different is it two messages in is it 10 messages in um so this is crazy and our booking rate again it's only a 10-day window so I want more data on this but so far is up from 11 to 16% so whatever that is 50- is% jump so that's huge so for us on as an example th000 bookings happen in a week so that's usually 110 of them come from there so what this actually is is not booked it's of bookings right is the is the metric how we track it so of our total bookings that we had in a given week we used to get 110 as of last week we have 160 so solid jump right 50 bookings increased let's say you have a a 10 to 15% close rate uh or sales per booking rate not close rate cuz close plus sh show or Times show um so yeah I mean right there alone is three units right on five maybe more or I'm sorry on five is five to 7 so that could be like 40K just right there on a onee range which is cool so getting into the pockets uh on here oops in the pockets on here so the simple answer is where can you apply this is like everywhere so you would based on these stats wouldn't you just say like yeah I want to apply it everywhere uh that you send an SMS and yes but no so like for us it is anywhere that how we're looking at it at least is anywhere that it's conversational looking for response so things like notifications like fulfillment reminders that we're not going to change one there's a cost two there's some limitations that I'll get into where it just like doesn't make sense to toggle that over but anywhere that's conversational looking for response because you're going to get in increased response rate and somewhere you have Baseline data so anywhere that you want to have communication have it look like a real person not just be a notification or a reminder uh it makes sense to use for us is how we're looking at it and somewhere you have Baseline data this is crazy important to me because I like like we here it'll just tell you it works right on some of these websites I'll show you it shows that they have like a 90% increase across the board on their clients for me I want to know what our Baseline data is before I do this so for an example like low ticket buyers not booked I don't have data on this yet right so I don't know how many on a normal SMS sending from Green will then uh after they become a low ticket buyer we try and push them to do a call with the setter so like how many of those book in is it 10% or 20% % we don't know that number yet so for me to just apply this like yes it'll work but how much better um so I need to do an accurate test so I did one only on this so this is important to us and for me just because I like to know where the levers are and where it's being pulled um but clearly based on this data you would know it would work better right um so automations and then manual are kind of the two buckets of where you can apply this so for automations for us it's app no booked it's low ticket buyers not booked it's no show cancels anywhere you can have uh so you'd have like a call confir style call confirmation so for us we have a triage team is what we call them but they call confirmation they call Double dial voicemail um to try and confirm the a booking within 3 to five minutes of a booking um and then they SMS if they did not respond so this could be another huge lift fulfillment reminders this is something I wouldn't do and I just want to put this on here as an example because I would want to keep these as no response unless you're going to have someone in house so CS or coaches or whoever that are actively going to monitor this um it just doesn't make sense cuz you don't want responses on those on reminders uh manual who would you then use not an automation to be able to just like access and log in on the back end it directs things to HubSpot which is cool but um sales reps Setters and then the question is fulfillment in coaches so for us our coaches use a dedicated platform that has all of the different uh like Fitness specific things this entire thing is for Fitness um so for us it doesn't make sense because we use an in platform so we don't actually even have phone lines for them they either use zoom or the in chat messaging so doesn't make sense Sal sales reps and Setters this is like the big question for me so getting into limitations as of now and this is what I've seen and again this March 2025 is going change tomorrow as fast as like the tech can change um but right now it's about 50 a day is the limit it is 50 a day so meaning So the plan that we have is like 3K a month or something but it's like API access in five lines so essentially you're paying whatever dollars for one phone number and that phone number can only do 50 new contacts a day but it can do unlimited messages me in right so if you had for us my real example is upwards of 250 app notebooks a day so I need at least five phone numbers because each one of those is going to count as a new contact one person can message that line and go back and forth on a thousand messages but it's just based on the contact so that's fine if you do that but for us because we needed 250 we got the line with fine uh five and we want the API because we don't even have anyone logging into the system to send messages the entire thing for us is API AI based all right so 50 line on line routing this is painful cuz this is how I'm looking at these so once someone has assigned a line to my understanding is they are like stuck in that one line at least on the software we're using right now um it clearly is crushing for us in this way but like if you're trying to use it from a sales rep after they already did an app no book it's like talking to Mandy is the name of our Ai and then after that it's going to be talking to a sales rep and they're using the same phone number and like what's the story behind that and how they would do that oh she's using my phone we're in the same offit like it's just kind of a weird situation um and then yeah that just causes overall confusion so there are like tons of different lines that auto routes through round robin assigns a line picks a contact or I'm sorry contact comes in assigns a line round robin and then they stick to that line um so I'm sure there's some way around that but this is like very limiting for me and trying to understand this um I've had I've heard a hor Moi video where he talks about he's like yeah I just get my sales wrapped iPhones and while that makes sense to me like completely the like for the actual use case the monitoring of it and the ability to see activity tracking stuff inside your HubSpot is very difficult so I I don't know I mean maybe if you have like a super good culture and you have if you're remote and have a super good culture if you're in person and it's like you can see everyone's stuff um maybe that's better but for us it just doesn't make sense right now to get our own iPhones especially with a high turn position like a Setter or ideally not a closer but sometimes closers so providers quick go into this um so I asked in a couple community these are the three that got sent to me I was already in contact with these guys and we worked with someone there a while ago so s BL is who we're currently using so if I just show you these so this is send blue um I think I have my screen like half shared but you can see so essentially it's just instead of sending Android you're sending this opt out language you can send voice notes you can do like the typing text you can do a ton of like ton of stuff um they got us up super fast got us a slack uh setup with them and we use their API and they're very technical and can solve all the things um so this one has worked well for us supposedly it's on the higher end and cost compared to the market uh I cannot confirm what those are but that's who we use I've heard these guys uh link is their name L NQ they do like business cards it looks like but then they also do this so I've heard good things about them and their direct integration to HubSpot ton of people doing this are like go high Lev people they're always at the front end of how to make money on other people's softwares and things like love them hate them but these guys and then this was another one I heard a lot about so uh High blue hu blue um right here I blue yeah these guys um but again we just use these guys s blue so that's current setup um I've heard interesting things like some people have like iPhone Farms some people use like actual Tech and I don't know the answer to that so I'm not endorsing anybody on here this who we're testing and these are some options but yeah this is the this is the confusing part on if we're going to be able to roll this out because I want to be able to do this because if I get these kind of response rates if I could roll this into the call confirm section or reminder section from a sales rep and from call call confirmation team our show rates could like double triple cuz currently we're using allware and we can't even send a video message on the mobile app so we can't even send like a selfie video that is like literally the most important part of trying to get a show rate it's like a personalized video there's no way to do that so we send a loom link and you can only send an image so like it's just it's terrible so if we could do this have the ability to send the multimedia right there we're going to get a lift have the ability to send it blue we're going to get a lift so I just need to figure out the tech behind this and how to do this like on line routing so it comes from the sales rep too um but yeah that's the general gist so hope everyone gets some value from this I'm going to do more of these updates and hopefully soon do some like quarterly updates monthly updates of where we are where we're scaling to and let me know if you have any questions in the comments messaging on Instagram talk soon
