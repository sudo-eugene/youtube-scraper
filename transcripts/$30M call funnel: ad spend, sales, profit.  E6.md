# $30M call funnel: ad spend, sales, profit. | E6
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihwlc0MbaZA

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through some simple info bism that we used to do 30 million in cash collected last year through one single call funnel all right so I'll go through what we used um some of the variances and some of the numbers and then what we're planning to do into the future so first things first what I have here is I'm essentially doing this per unit so per new client so just to do that instead of having everything up from cost per click down and trickling I'm just trying to simplify this I pulled this together this morning um so cost per lead so let's say you're getting a $20 cost per lead and again this funnel is uh optin so lead application after watching a vssl and doing consumption booking getting on the phone with the sales rep getting on zoom and then purchasing okay so first things first is we're going to say we have a $20 cost per lead now how many of those leads are then going to become an application so let's say and for us let's call it rough numbers uh 20% okay so then your cost per app is going to be $100 right now how many of those people people go fill out a full 16 177 question application like they do with us and then end up booking a call right so this has a lot of factors actually um so you can you can basically make it like super low friction so as soon as someone's done it just lands and it's like now you do schedule your call you can frame it on the application side that you're applying for the call right and there's a lot of ways to get around or kind of get this percentage up higher um we've had it 67 I mean we've had it really high before um but for us what we actually wanted to do was add friction there so if you look on ours for example this is probably helpful if I just do this as we go too so for us instead of just you know putting this here and then just putting the widget we actually try and like pre-frame them a ton which is um it it detracts right it like makes it so less people book in um and we do that because we want only qualified people and it's more of like we don't want more volume we want more qualified volume not just like raw volume um so for us let's just call this 50 % on here another thing that we do is routing so if there's routing uh of DQ people where you can uh disqualify this number could be 40 it could be 45 it could be 30 um depending so all these numbers are very malleable but like let's just call it uh let's just call 45 for this so that'll have your cost per booking actually 50 just for quicker math um so your cost per booking is going to be 200 and that's pretty realistic and I don't want to directly show CU we have so many stats on that sheet that I have but this is rough uh about what we're at cost per live call now how many people are actually going to show up on that call this is another thing I have other videos on show rates um currently we have actually terrible show rates this is very candid Channel I don't really care about lying or guring you but like our show rates right now are 45 to 50% we changed a bunch of automations we had like malicious bad stuff ranking on Google that didn't make any sense that was incorrect information that were getting taken down uh we changed up something with Google branded search like Perfect Storm um so they're like 45 but steady they have been 50 5% um and that's what I'm use for this and that's not unrealistic at all um when you start to getting like 60 and 70 and whatever percent from a direct booking that's kind of like out of my range unless you have some hormos style where then all of these numbers go down and all of these numbers go up because you have some crazy offer um but for us just saying like with current state and where we're at um so I'll get you $364 to have someone on the phone okay now how many of those close let's call it 15% okay so in that model you have 15% of the live calls you're taking this is generally and like when crushing closer to 20% all right so just there just on the marketing side right for one unit it's costing you $1,800 and this is assuming at scale and all these things right um you could be selling two units and you could be sell and have spent $2,000 in ads and have one unit or you could sell and I'll get into that later like how many units in the breakdown but this is just for One Singular unit okay now new cash just dragged something um so new cash aov 7,000 okay so different people have different offers let's call it 3,000 right and this is where math starts to get crazy like if you don't have a high enough aov on this and and for aov I'm talking new cash collected not Revenue not any of that just like literally Blended if you sold 10 units some use pay plans some use full pay whatever pick that actual dollar value that's the aov that is the average amount that we that you collected on the new Cash There's retention numbers there's future P there's all this kind of stuff but just using the uh front cash in terms of having month-over-month cash flow in one snapshot okay so aov 7gs okay now sales commissions this is also highly debated and back and forth so for us we have W2 employees for the longest time we had contractors but because we're building for future scale exit all that kind of stuff we moved everyone in house um back and forth on if this was going to idea uh just direct cost it's 20% higher just like out of the box um so if you're paying someone $110,000 it's 12 or it's $12,000 now um and that's just in all the US tax structure and all that kind of um or tax system and how all that works so let's call this 12% what this doesn't include is managers so I have other models and stuff where I break out the management of the these but like for this snapshot again this is just going to be like per unit and then cost to fulfill cost to uh sales cost and ads all those pieces and then the gross margin is then what hits overhead and you could classify the managers as overhead and those kind of pieces um but just for a simplified model of this so your uh sales commission 12% so sales reps is going to make on average $8,400 call it and again this maybe goes up because there's bonus pools because there's if they hit different thresholds and toggles and whatever uh we're going to use it at 12 because for ours it is basically this is very close um to what ours is and we're constantly not constantly changing it but we we've gone through phases of changing it over time um fulfillment cost so hormos has a good number so I'm just going to throw it in here as 20% this is not what ours is um just based on the new structure of how we have things performance uh retention numbers stuff like that that play into it that are more important for us on kpis to drive solid fulfillment um all right so it's 20% so what you have here is your cost per client I just brought down this ad so it's actually add cost per client just so not get confusing or OCD is going to kill me um all right so cost per client on the ads you're spending $1,800 to collect $7,000 on ads you're then paying a coach 8.40 you're paying a uh I'm sorry you're paying a sales rep 840 and then you're paying your coach 1400 okay so that gross margin left over is about $3,000 for every new unit of 7K now this does not account for excuse me um this does not account for refunds this does not account for uh multitude of things um again this is just overview math but call that 5% call that whatever number um and then do your math accordingly because this is like really really important um napkin math uh but so that's 42% gross margin now how many units per month so if you're just scaled down and doing you know called 100 so I guess depending on who you are scaled down but 700,000 in new cash which would leave the company 300K to pay managers to pay software to pay other vendors to pay everything owners man like everything uh so you got to really pay attention especially like for us this is one offer one structure nowhere else that we're collecting cash now where else is there Cash There's cash on retention so let's say of these 100 units and we sell an annual program so of these 100 units let's go like really low you have 20% of them um that are going to renew okay so the cost per new client I'm sorry cost per retained I should have done this before but let's just say retention unit is uh let's say it's a 5k renewal because we have different things like that and then what is the cost on that the cost for the coach only right so because your cost per coach is the only cost you're going to have on the back end so your net on retention is going to be right so you're going to have an 80% margin I just want to show you the actual math I understand that that wasn't that difficult to math but right so you're going to have 4,000 now let's say 20% of those are renewing I'm literally just going to rip this real quick all right so 20% of these would be 20 of them at yeah so that would be 80k let's call it right there that you'd have in net retention dollars in terms of the the gross that would actually come back to the company um but it would actually be 100,000 right um because 20 new units on this assuming that so this is where a lot of the money is made for a lot of these guys um um so if you can keep the customer past the initial period whether it's a six-month program a 3-month program an annual program like we do um this is where like the real money's made because you don't pay for a sales rep because you don't pay for ads again once you have them in the system so this is another thing for like Ascension so a lot of people have masterminds or higher ticket things so in this example I used a lower ticket thing because we're selling 7K for the first year but for us a lot of the time um a coach will have or a client will have you know basically gotten the gist through that and they want to stay in for Community for accountability um that piece of it uh for the longest time we did I mean we still technically do it at basically the same rate just like $1,000 down so very very close but a lot of them had gotten in at that initial pricing and then since then we have raised pricing on the front end um but then we'll do twice a year special that's 5K so I just use that as an example uh for retention only so just another example but all the say 42% now let's mess with the numbers let's say and just to be so candid and just try and be like as real as possible with everyone here um so let's say you crank this up and do like 400 units which is where we were at uh when we were at total scale and again to be blunt we have scaled down since and I can kind of get into that in other videos um but we're rebuilding now up in a more structurally sound maybe way instead of just ramping from 10 million to 30 million in one year which is what we did um so the units per month uh 400 so that would give you 2.8 and then it drop 1.17 now why this is important is if you're in a position like us so I just kept everything exactly the same which again at scale does not happen at scale let's just say quick is your freaking your cost per lead goes to here and all of a sudden you lose 10% gross margin okay just by jumping to a $27 lead and again it could be anywhere in this step it could be your cost per booking it could be the quality that comes through which then you have to go back and then you're changing out lead because really what would happen is your cost per lead would stay the same but all of a sudden your close rate could be like let's just say everything I'll stay the same but the lead quality just tanks close rate is 10% bad bad okay so this is important to know like every single section of this and also to be able to diagnose what's happening because you constantly need to have a pulse on what's Happening so like we have automated trackers for all of these things so we can see day over day we can see week over week month over month uh quarter year and then in comparison to and then we have basically like a like a notes log tracker of like what changed when if we roll out new stuff in ads if we were testing something in Landers we're doing splits something like that and then majority of that stored in HubSpot and sheets as well to track these but why this is important I keep going on tangent sorry but why this is important is because let's say you are staffed up like us and you have 110 W2 employees who are all making base including sales reps including whatever but your volume is half your booking calendar 30% um your unit just so your units fall to like 100 you are now only bringing 300K so like here in units your margin is to the same or I'm sorry here in this like model per unit your margin stays the same so you're still bringing 42% back to the company cool right not cool because now you're only bringing 294 Grand to the company on a monthly basis and what if your payroll is 500 Grand or your softwares or your this or your that right like that is where this becomes an issue and I don't want to say something like we didn't think about because we always we always were pretty proactive about this but like at what number is break even more or less in terms of like net of the company um yeah that was a dance so once you get 250 once you get into 400 how much money is coming back to the company and staying there and then how much is your overhead how much as your overhead as a percentage some of these people are kpi so theirs does like for example like a sales manager a Setter manager stuff like that they're directly tied to the new cash so like their over their portion overhead decreases or increases with the new cash cash that comes in great who's doesn't um marketing generally speaking there's this kind of kpi but not really um the head guys but not like the actual just like boots on the ground um the Cs team not at all the tech team not at all the right like the all these people have like flat pays um that and then sales rep same thing like I just said when we moved everyone to W2 uh everyone has bases so if you're only filling calendars 30% people are still getting the base the federal minimum or whatever they're State minimum that they make so call it 40 grand 50 60 depending on the state of what they can legally make so for the minimum they can make unless you have them on hourly then it's this whole other Gambit so instead of salary but all right so that is current state or basically this is what the model we ran at right here okay and again these numbers are roughish like app to lead could be 15% app to lead could be 25% cost per lead 20 is pretty accurate but like I have I have math going back to like 20 23 was $9 but our aov was like $1,500 and there was no cost fulfill because we were selling an info product so that's another piece like if you have this same model so is that right 25 yeah now let's say your cost to fulfill is zero so this is where you start to uh hear about or like very marginal I call like two so a lot of these guys will do group coaching that's like wider and um Iman gazi has a good video where he talks about this where he did 70% margin on like 70 million which is like nowhere near what we did in margin in dollars yes but in margin no um and that's due to two things that in my opinion that is the acquisition cost because of so much organic and all that kind of brand builtup and then also the cost to fulfill is not 20% on his right well so one in info business in general if you're selling a login or access or group coaching or stuff like that it's either marginal or literally zero um so like you have a kajabi login it's it could be as simple as like kajabi login group coaching Facebook group so you're paying a community manager more or less yes you're pay there are overhead pieces like Cs and stuff like that um but you're paying Community manager and then you're paying like group coaches Andor you you are the group coach that is in there and it's what's your time worth but like in true cash what does it cost very very little um so if you have that kind of model where you have like a 2% here and then you know just for to make this easy on the math your cost per lead is like $3 instead like that is where you start to get into crazy behavior because you get 82% on the front end unit and then on the back you still run lean and it costs you know another 10% and you're keeping 50 to 70% of the of new cash of all cash um so yeah so that's just not the model we've run on everything for us has been paid we do have a strong organic presence but like if you hos it and track like where it actually comes from it's used for nurture and and proof of product and like actual you know that we are real business and stuff like that uh more so than it is I mean definitely more so than it is for cold I mean we get sub five sub two whatever percent of the new purchases originate from organic uh and that's probably just because we haven't done a good job prioritizing it or doing correctly um but yeah we are at somewhat on the hamster wheel of constantly having to acquire customers other than dialing in this attention and this is current state so how long am I oh man I'm already at 60 minutes sorry all right V2 this is where we are headed and this is what we are testing so again this is all hypothetical I know I've seen people do this I know the math works I know that also actually executing on it has not occurred to be candid no guru so now let's say this model is running low ticket at scale okay so you're going to have uh cost per low ticket and there's again there's stuff above this it's cost per click it's the two-step a lot of people do on order form so it's percentage of people that go from front end to order form it's then order form aov like it's all these different pieces this is a simplified way that'll still work I still show you what I mean um so cost per low ticket so let's say it is the cost per low ticket to acquire one is $60 okay and again this is going to change dramatically if you're selling a $9 product or if you're selling a $150 product or if you're selling whatever but just for simplification and what I'll use and these are basically the example of what we're actually using so $60 uh I'm not going to fill this in yet just show you so the set Call To Low ticket so for us the Otto and what a lot of these guys do the post-p purchase Otto is actually schedule your implementation call now there's a different frame and we currently do this for closers which is not good because it goes into a closer but the frame of the call is like schedule your implementation call that comes with the low ticket then you just bought completely different frame than someone who's applying in to basically figure out what war VIP is cost and stuff like that so now we're rolling out a Setter team as of this week um so March 2025 um going to give it a go so these will actually book with Setters as implementation calls and then the whole point there is basically vet them get them up to speed help them where they need and then push them into a call with the closer so Setter call to this so historically we've actually just booked these with Setters or I'm sorry with closers and it's been like 40 something percent uh it's been like 45 40% now they're not speed deleting them they're not uh doing outbound dials to them they're not like all of these things so I'm pretty confident that like we could get this 50% % let's call it all right now set call percentage this is going to completely vary and this is kind of like shot out of a cannon I'm not 100% sure um but let's say the set for uh the set call is of that again this is going to be higher so this going to be 60% I'm banking on uh now how many of those then get set let's call it 40% uh closer call show now in the last one I said it was 55 and that is direct ad book raw so all the automations all the amazing things we have that get us there but now we're introducing it went through a Setter directly who found the time on their calendar went back and forth and vetted the person so for this let's call it 70% which should be fantastic and then the ratio of the close rate is now you're not talking to someone who watched an ad at 8:00 p.m. on their couch booked a call for the next morning and then just got on okay so that's going to hurt show rates that's going to hurt close rates that's going to hurt everything so let's say this is a 25% close okay aov same 7,000 sales commission same 12% now there's a Setter commission that did not exist before let's call that 3% fulfillment cost same thing we're going to put that at 20% all right so in this math now so on our last one is this right gross margin where did I change cool all right so in this now your gross margin is essentially the same right so just with these costs here it's going to cost you $60 to get a buyer it's going to cost you $100 to get someone on the phone with a Setter it's going to cost you 250 to get them on with the closer of the people who show again I think this will be higher too personally um Clos rate could be higher especially if we can already achieve 20% sometimes uh steady steady state we haven't but like 20% um so this will keep your uh I'm sorry so call cost per live live cost per live closer call would be 333 and cost per new client is $1,300 new cash same cost per client and ads variable cost these would stay the same we now added cost because we added a Setter so we have 210 so we net out at 3200 okay so that is 45 46% margin basic on p with over here now where this changes is when you're selling a product which is what this is this does not account for having the low ticket dollars liquidating so right now we're selling something that has a $37 aov okay so all I'm doing here is I'm going to take out that aov from the cost per low ticket to get you a net okay so instead of it direct costing $60 to get this person what it really costs I mean what really cost $60 but uh in ads but it cost $60 in ads but then you got back $37 of it all right so in that model your net cost per uh to acquire someone was 23 so you're not fully liquidating you're not making money on the front end you're not any of that kind of stuff you're just making it cost less for every action that happens after that fact okay so $38 for a Setter call then 96 and look at the comparables on this like as it goes down the track all the way down to having 57% margin let's go back to our 400 units a month example so you're picking up another 800 bucks for these and I didn't fully flush this out as to like where the new cash would come with low ticket and like because you technically have like in a quick example like a 4% Ascension rate from low ticket so you would have sold 100 of these to close four units or 25 to sell one unit quick math there but uh I can pledge this out as we actually do this this is all hypothetical completely hypothetical what could happen here is this could be $100 and it could be an increase but not a crazy increase but still at scale fantastic right and the big thing here is this number that's dropping to the bottom line obviously because then that fuels the rest of the team make sure that all that's covered and then actual true profit so by no means is this like the I mean it is kind of like not necessarily Cash Cow in terms of that but you dial this in and get this like aov up you get cost per this down you get all of these like you know you can play this game a lot of ways but you can get a lot of these down a a lot of these up and make more money okay uh fulfillment cost is not 20 this around right this around right aov you can increase and sell more these are the toggles that like I focus on a lot of the time okay and then other big thing is retention numbers that will then add on to this so if you have 45 on the front and can push 50 on the front and then also have 80% on the back and have a retention engine which I'm already at like 20 something minutes so I'm going to stop but that's a behemoth and then if you can do this at scale that's how all these big guy like I know two different companies currently that are doing over 10 million a month 100 million a year so actually 120 a year um that are doing this model a little different here with like set or call and forc whatever but they're selling a low ticket or more more so they're selling a direct to cart so they're selling 2750 $2,000 product upfront direct to cart meaning they can buy it on their own and then doing basically our business model on the back so this whole time we've been running basically the back end business business model and why it's so can get so constrained is because if the acquisition goes wonky and all of a sudden your cost per acquisition is $3,000 instead of 1,500 or whatever like you're digging into a a deep red hole okay and it's not ideal and coming from experience of when we had marketing blow up and then CPA was crazy high and then you scale down but then marketing uh isn't filling calendars and then you do fill calendars but then sales reps aren't closing because of bad vibes like it's it's constantly figuring something out and because we have been on One Source One flow one funnel it is like ex like the the magnifying glass is just on so what we're trying to do now is mitigate that through multiple traffic sources multiple offers we have multiple brand faces and then all funneling back to the back end which is essentially our current entire company in terms of sales fulfillment CS all that so keeping the whole coaching piece as the the back end with just with higher margins on the per unit and then attempting to liquidate and just overall brand awareness way up by going direct response heavy so these other guys that do 120 million both all of them do uh or both of them in the example I'm using are doing whatever call five six million or something on the front on the front being in these low ticket things unknown on how much to spend in ads but you got to assume it's that is is so maybe they are making a little money maybe they're losing a little bit of money whatever but then all the money the big money is made in the back on the coaching because you're selling something that's 7K 8K 15K on the back and your acquisition cost has been liquidated either partially or fully um so yeah this is just common practice these are just examples of or numbers that for us are pretty real like especially these um again there's some variants in a lot of these for us and it can go it can change month over month um but I just want to give kind of sneak peek view into what we did what we're moving towards or attempting to move towards and our goal is to continue to run this mod or I'm sorry this model like at the same time almost as we do this and then just hyper Focus so the people who are ready to buy are going direct through um the higher ticket who are like ready for coaching than the people who are going through it's more of a mass Market play especially with us with 46y old women in this business uh so yeah so that's kind of the general gist and again none of this is Guru you know this is oh this is the way to do it exactly by any means there are people who do like I just said 70% margins on the entire business and the math I just showed is 30 or 40% on the unit before overhead so like there's a lot of ways to do this if you're trying to make two three five million bucks then there's a simpler way likely than having 110 employees and a bunch of different structural things and team meetings and W2 and HR managers and all that and like constant ad flow and if you don't hit your quota in terms of marketing things then there's no new unit and like this Downstream effect like there's a lot of mov Parts here and it can be very focused in so there's a lot of ways to make a buck and not to say this is the one just showing what we did and what we're currently doing so thank you everyone droping in comments anything I have kind of a running list of just random ideas that I'm making these videos daily as of now uh until I run out of ideas um but yeah let me know if you guys want anything specific or are curious about anything drop in the comments bye
