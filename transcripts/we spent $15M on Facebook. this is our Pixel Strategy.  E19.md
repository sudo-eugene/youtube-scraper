in today's video I'm going to share how we have our pixel set up for our high tick vssl call funnel as well as our low ticket Ascension funnel how these two connect the different events we are firing at each phase of the funnel and then if you stick around to the end I'm going to share how we fire browser and server events for purchases that happen over Zoom or call because it's a huge issue in tracking all right so last year we did 30 million in cash collected in 2024 and I make all these videos on the channel just to share what did work what did not work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a solid network of people doing the same all right so let's get into it so first things first as I just kind of like a little explainer this is mainly going to be me talking for meta it does work for Google in the same way or very similar way but just for ease of conversation we'll just say meta so what we're going to want to do is you're going to have browser events and server events and you'll hear this kind of all over the place but browser is essentially just when you have the pixel installed on site and it's when a user goes to something on site it fires back to Facebook so it's capturing the information can about a person uh from them being onsite server is what you're collecting and then passing back through the conversion API okay so different tools like we have hyos installed we're not currently using it to send to the pixel and we have a custom setup uh currently installed that I'm going to go through it here but uh hyros essentially does the server side and then just having the pixel on your site does the browser and the main goal is is to get these to match so if you look at like your leads for example and you look in the back office of events manager your main goal is to have those two lines aligned so browser and server are the same and then then you're D duplicating so you're not uh firing it as twice but you're just showing that they're matched so the same person who's on site is what you're sending server and it aligns because in Facebook's like okay cool the person actually was there and they're sending us more information from server so to go through the funnel opt-in page currently they come in give us name and email and then they land on one of these two oops vsl pages okay on this we are going to fire the lead event everything we're going to try and optimize for and there's guys who have really good videos about this Jeremy Haynes has really good videos about pixel training and this just our uh setup of this but he goes very in- depth into how you want to use default conversion events because then you can basically use all the other people that use Facebook for those default conversion events and it'll find from that pocket versus if you use a custom conversion you're basically just using only your data and only your portion when this allows basically better training on the entire Facebook algorithm so for us we're going to fire a lead and then someone's going to land on this application page now when somebody applies they're going to get routed based on a financial qualifier in ours so there's a lot of different ways you can do this on lead scoring and this is very common practice now but for us we essentially have if it's less than 1K 1 to 5K 5 to 10 10 to 20 and 20 plus I believe um and on those excuse me for us we just use the less than 1K as a DQ okay and then anything above that comes through so for the bookings when they land on the booking page that is going to be a native event of a submit application okay because when they finish the application they land on the booking page now down here what we'll do is depending on how much availability we have if we need more bookings we actually allow them to book so there's actually like a little toggle here that routes them but if we need more bookings on day into the next day we'll allow them to book through a DQ which goes to a different round robin and kley that'll have just less quality um like not as experienced reps so either people ramping or those who are kind of like down in the bucket uh that just don't have as high as sale per booking so we'll still allow the bookings to come through but we will not pass the information to the pixel okay so that's the key here on the pixel training the I'll go into this in a second once they land on here they will book a call and that will fire a schedule event okay so all we're firing on the main vssl is going to be a lead a submit app and a schedule okay we'll get into purchases over here now why is important is because on page we have this installed so it's firing the lead the submit app and the schedule and on the back end on the conversion API we are firing as much information as we has on as as we have on that person back as a server event too so you're getting a browser and a server for lead for a submit app and a schedule okay now DQ nothing happens nothing I mean like the the pixels installed but there's no events that actually occur so to Fire and then when we are full calendars pack we actually pass them over to the low ticket so I have over here we have two different pixels you're going to have the main pixel and the low ticket pixel so the main pixel is this blue that's firing all these uh places here low ticket both of these places right here are inflows this optin page for the for the vssl for the free training and and then these actually technically all as one and then we're just running a three-way split right now I just want to show you so this will get um this actually has the green but this gets traffic direct to it and it also gets it through this vsl funnel so once these come in they're going to land on a frontend sales page for the low ticket and it's basically a two-step so to in order to check out they have to put in their name and email and they go to a secondary page and that for us fires a lead event we also have an initiate checkout I don't know if it's going to fit in this box it's not but you know what I mean int checkout we'll do that so uh lead is going to fire when they get to the second page initiate checkout is going to fire when they start doing it so JavaScript on uh on page it's when they're actually starting to fill out the form it'll fire initiate checkout they'll then land on the uh success page which is a purchase so all you're getting is a lead then when someone's filling it out initiate checkout and then a purchase on these now these we then have a booking widget okay so in current form we have nothing here but these bookings are going to go in and book with a Setter all right so these are not the same quality type of bookings uh as somebody who is booking up here direct after being qualified and through this so we do a layer of talking to a Setter as like essentially a triage and Lead filtering so for this we currently don't have anything but we're talking about putting a custom conversion in here that's going to be like a custom schedule so not the main schedule cuz we don't want to pollute it with that but we're in talks right now we have nothing they land on this and then they fill out an application that just gives us more context for the setter okay so to zoom out of here you have two different pixels you have the green down here which is going to be the low ticket and then you have the blue up here which is going to be the vssl main all right and the same thing works as you have as we're rolling out more and more so when we're going to have another secondary vssl another secondary low ticket that's in a different um Niche or more so like an angle so let's say like menopause versus macronutrient we would have a completely different pixel setup for a completely different low ticket right so we're not going to plute them with the same so you're going to have one pixel for low ticket menopause one uh for vssl menopause you're going to have one for macronutrient Load Ticket you're going to have and you're going to have all these different pixels for each one to keep them dedicated and trained okay and generally speaking it's the same thing with the ad account that's going to be running through that is so you're going to have the different ad account with a different pixel with a different funnel okay and dedicated same thing with Google we have a complete dupe of this for Google so that we don't um blend the traffic up here we still have one main and like supposedly that's not how you're supposed to do it so we're working on fixing that and as we roll out this load ticket working on fixing that but that's how we fire these through directly okay so the next question is what happens after this so they either talk to a Setter talk to a closer everything else is happening in HubSpot so we've collected all this information we're storing it in HubSpot for the server side as well as we do have hyros on hyros is kind of like a quick easy fix to the server side it just doesn't get as much information necessarily but because it stores the fingerprints and like the m multiple uh attribution sources it's all baked into a profile in hyros and then you're able to just send that on stripe purchase or on whatever to make it as a purchase we're trying something different that we've been trying for about six months that's all custom that's storing everything in HubSpot custom and then the browser stuff is all happening just the same way basically now this part it's kind of the fun part so for this when someone buys they're buying over the phone or over Zoom right so we're on right now I give you the credit card information you purchase and why that's not great is because the the customer never actually did anything on page to check out so different than like physical Ecom where someone's checking out it can easily fire pixel and server because the person's on page doing it for the browser server side is just everything that was collected send that and they're both matching cool but for call funnels and high ticket stuff like this or basically where you're just taking it it's it's considered an offline conversion and there's no easy way out of the box hos does it but again it has to like collect all that fingerprint information the amounts so if you're doing custom pay plans someone pays 2 then 5K it counts as two purchases you got to merge them and then send it like it just gets a little Messier as you start to scale unless you're just selling one standardized Thing One Price over the phone all in hyros easy simple but as you get to kind of a little more custom it it it breaks a little bit so what we have here is we're going to fire a purchase to the low ticket or a purchase to the so either this pixel or this pixel dependent on the source they came to start right so if they came through the low ticket then they ended up talking to a Setter getting on a closer calendar and purchased that purchase we have tracked inside HubSpot that's going to know if they Source if their initial Source was through the vssl funnel or through here now you're going to have people did that did both like a lot of the time and but if they did low ticket you're going to want to attribute it to the low ticket because that's where they came from right the whole idea here is you're training the pixel on their actual source and we were trying to keep this as clean as possible and this is kind of like an everchanging thing so I will be able to update this into the future but we're going to Route them for thing so you're going to pick and for us instead of firing it on like a checkout page like you could on low ticket like on these for example this is super easy to do server and browser we're going to fire it on oops we're going to fire it on our terms page this is a cool workaround that we figured out so sales rep checks out the person over the phone they fill out their information in the order form or their buy link or their whatever sends them a dedicated terms link that has tracking in it that will autofill some of the information basically like in a hidden form inside a jot form for us and then on submission that'll fire the browser and the server event okay so instead of it just firing the server event very easily from the buy link cool but there was never any browser event and Facebook loves browser events because they can see the person's actually taking the action so by just sending them a dedicated terms link we can capture the browser and the server and then route back get the deal amount that's a total amount that they assigned in HubSpot can get all the hidden uh uh I guess well hidden Fields but um deeper data that's everything from like the IP address the first Source the click the the Facebook ID like all those different pieces are stored in HubSpot and can be sent together so this is how we're looking at it um we changed this about six months ago we have about the same results there's a ton of people who have done this who have crazy better results but our issue is more so around how we've been running marketing and sales at that time um but this setup itself is like matching it works so right now we're duping this entire thing out and super and S soon we will be for Google as well um but this whole thing is going to be tested out in Google and duped um something we did he on this is that like you can't send purchases back to both for example so like if someone bought uh paid 7200 you can't fire that purchase on server side back to both of these I guess that's like against terms some people do it and say they have good results we don't we just pick one and we go back and forth depending um but yeah I hope this kind of gives a a brief intro into this uh I really want to go into another video on these about like costs and percentages through and how much routing and like these what percentage they close at versus these um but yeah this all work in progress all these videos are me just sharing what we're actively doing not necessarily what is 100% the right way we don't know we're just trying to like I said up here we're just trying to show what did work what didn't work and what we are actively doing um so yeah so subscribe on to here if you want to see more of these comment let me know what you want more info on and then Instagram always for DMS and communication and all that so let me know if you have any questions and I will talk with you all soon
