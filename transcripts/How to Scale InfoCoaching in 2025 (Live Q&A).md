# How to Scale Info/Coaching in 2025 (Live Q&A)
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EDHaUd3OA0

What's up, guys? We are back with the weekend Q&A round 11. You guys submitted all of these questions here to the request box over the last week or so, and today I'm going to answer every single one of them. Everything from low ticket offers to secrets to accountability, a lot of context on where people are stuck or in ideiation, which I love to answer these ones. All the things picking an offer and market, business model choice. This is going to be a good one. Haven't done this in a minute. So excited. All right. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 82 million in total cash collected and we are currently doing a record month. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. I have caffeine and I have nicotine and I am prepared. Talk about your new low ticket offer. How it's talk about how your new low ticket offer is doing and the things you've done to optimize it. All right. So, I actually was thinking about using this little like pencil thing over here for the first time. So, we run Oh, no. There's no way I'm doing that. Uh, we run ads direct to a low ticket and with the goal of it ascending. Okay, so the difference on how we mainly focus on these. A lot of people will do AOV focus. So, they will send to um a low ticket that'll then ascend up and have like a 297 with an OTO1 and then a down cell and then this and this. Our entire goal of ours is to get ascension into our high ticket. And we do that by having on the thank you page pushing them to book a call that is actually with a setter that um kind of acts like a CS and setter. So it's like did you get access to all the stuff? Here's what you're going to get. And then also why didn't you apply for the main thing and then if they're a good fit, they'll then set them with the closer and go. So the biggest issue we've had on this thus far is being able to scale it into cold traffic at the volume and size we want to. Um because let's say you're getting a 4% ascension rate. So I'm gonna do math on my phone just because every time I do math on the freaking thing it like shows everything on my screen. Um so if you are getting let's say it cost you $50. So you sell something for $50 and it cost you $100 to get the purchaser. Okay? So 100us 50 is a $50 net cost and then 4% of those people ascend. Okay? So of those people of the 100 people that purchase that 4% ascend. That's a $1,200 $1,250 cost per your back-end program, your high ticket, the thing you're sending them into. Okay, so that's the model we're playing. Now, the biggest issue for us is when we scale over X number of units right now, the math breaks. Okay, so the economics are great up until a certain point. And that's just because it's not really built as much for cold traffic um as much as it is almost as like a retargeting asset. So, we are building a new low ticket offer um that is more cold friendly, but we are trying to do it in a way that we're just kind of like the new one that we're talking about is like, okay, cool. Can we do a time based one? And we don't do anything that's time based, but a ton of people do. So, like imagine like uh 14 days to get fit or like the fiveday um you know, trading master class or something that's like this low ticket offer. Um, but the issue with those that were h the hypothesis is that that's going to be hard to ascend people because they are going to not want to get on a call and talk to someone about some other thing until they've consumed x amount of days versus an info product where you just sell um something right there. They get instant access. They already have everything and it's like, oh, and this other thing versus they don't know what's to come in future days. So, they're like, "Oh, I want to consume this before I do this." So, we may have shot ourselves in the foot a little. Um, and those maybe work better for actual like AOV plays, so with upsells and stuff. So, we'll see how that goes. But, we have not even launched the other one yet because we care so much about brand and quality and all this stuff. So, it takes us a little bit longer to launch things and we're a little bit more corporate, which I don't love all the time, but I do like that we maintain the branding quality. So, all to say still has the best best economics in the entire company until a certain threshold and we cannot scale beyond that in current state. Um, we're also doing some things with like what we're doing for lists and like how we're emailing like where the traffic comes to this. Um, because if it's just cold and then all the optim optimizations that occur within there, it's like at XYZ dollars, but when we we can market it to other lists that we have, we can market it to like people who came in through VSSL funnels. We can do all these things that we like haven't been doing, which is stupid. Um, and we just figured out and like the cost is insanely dropped because obviously we're getting traffic that's for free or included in what we've already paid for. So hopefully that answers Sup, Ryan. What's your secret to accountability? What do you use to track your day, the things you did, and be actually consistent? What do you look for in a team to make things spicier? Okay, I got to go one by a time. Oh, Blick. What up, G? Um, secret to accountability. So, I've had a major issue with this for a long time. Um, not major, but there's been periods of my life where this has been literally zero or negative where you like can't even trust yourself to do XYZ. Um, but like stack the little wins has been a big one that I was always taught and told and that has worked for me. So like you say you're going to get up at 5 am every day like get up at 5 am every day and like make like keep a promise that you have with yourself um for the accountability portion. Um a lot of people do like friend accountability like accountability partners. I don't really do that um that much. Um I'm going to make a YouTube video every single day for 30 days turned into 120 days like just to keep the promise to myself at some level. And it was I was getting a feedback loop. Feedback loop is big. um being able to get that back. Um how I then track my day, I just live by the calendar. I could do a better job with this because like right now as I'm like pulling away at things. So like I pulled back the YouTube thing every day. I pulled back um a lot of the meeting structure and cadence I have and implement have team in place that are doing these things. It's like my day is starting to free up again and like me with a free day is like the worst thing on the planet for me. Like I just I I like lose it all. So I like to be busy. Um which is probably another internal issue or something that I can solve for. But I usually track everything based on the calendar. So or plan everything for the calendar and then viciously execute what's based on the calendar. How I actually track things that I did. Um I mean it's generally like a look back. I keep stupid simple to-do lists like based on like what bucket. So like this company, this company, this personal thing, this whatever. Like I have a personal bucket. I have like main co. I have like side quests. And then I kind of have health, but I've actually dropped off that one a lot. Like I still go to the gym every day, but like it's just there. Um, but yeah, so I track those in like to-do lists and I actually delete the thing after it's on the to-do list, not check it off, which kind of like I've heard people are like, "Yeah, it doesn't you don't ever feel like you completed anything, but like I don't give a shit." So, uh, what do I look for in a team? A self starter. Someone who goes above and beyond. Someone who asks questions when they need, but just knows how to like go in and try and solve something for themselves. Somebody who Yeah. Someone who doesn't like ask me a bunch of questions as much. Like I'm I'm literally down to help all the time. But I think I've almost gone too far in the direction sometimes where it's like I've gone too far in the directions both times where it's like they just got this like handle it. And then also like I'm going to micromanage the [ __ ] out of this and like both have not worked. So like that dance in between is like let's be collaborative but like you run this and like give them the autonomy to do so. Um I don't want to know skill sets or mindset. What's the smallest hint that separates a talker from a competent person? Uh I think you can tell very quickly in a conversation with someone. I just messaged someone on uh Instagram who I met at an event and I was like great like one of the best talks I had there cuz I literally ran into him on the way to the bathroom and we talked in the hallway and like 12 seconds in I was like oh like 30 seconds in I was like oh he knows what's like going on or like oh within this domain he like really knows what's going on. Um I would classify myself as a yapper as of recent. I never really was a yapper, but now I kind of just yap a lot and I think I could be better at that and more articulate and um you know, even this I'm seven and a half minutes in. Like I could have answered this more direct. Um but that's not really what these are for. So I think that's a big one is you can tell when someone knows their [ __ ] You can tell when someone knows like a percent about something or you know they're like, "Oh yeah, well that's okay. What's the number for this?" Or, "Oh, okay. That's interesting." Or like, "Oh, like they use words too." Like depending on what domain you're talking about. If I was I'm not competent about tennis, but if you would ask me a question about tennis, like I would be the a talker or like wouldn't know what to say. But if you ask me something about this, I could be like the most competent person in the room potentially. Like there's different domains, too. So, I don't know. Hopefully, that makes sense. If you currently had a 9 to5 but have an immense desire to start something, how would you start? How would you set up your time? Uh what specific skills, actions would you start taking today? Yeah, you just got to learn a skill set that people are willing to pay for and then just do it outside of your hours. I mean, or on top of your hours, but I'm not a super fan of that because I have team members and I would not be thrilled if they were doing it on my time slash, you know, company time. So, yeah, I would just learn a skill set. So, marketing is the one that our world kind of plays into. So, there's a lot of guys who do like affiliate lead genen, that's all marketing, almost exclusively, all marketing. Um, that's running ads, that's doing creatives, that's doing copy, that's doing all those things. Um, there's local business ones that are service based. So like anything that ends up being a service based because when you do lead genen affiliate and all that you're spending money that could just be zero versus service you're just selling your time um which is not you know that as big of a deal like you only have so much of it sure but at the same time like it's an easier way and a much higher margin way to do it. Um so yeah I would just start there just learn a skill set and then deploy it. I've talked about this a lot but like learn something that's hot now. So anything in marketing anything that what do companies need? What do people need? They need more clients. They need more uh retention. They need more sales. They need more whatever. So, you just pick one of those and actually stick to it. Don't do everything. Just do one thing and just learn it and then do it outside your 9 to5. So, do your 5 to9, you know, 5 to 9, right? 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. And it sucks and you I mean, if that's not your speed, but sometimes it's what it takes if you have to be locked into this. I love your take on my situation. Me and my buddy just started offering design services. How would you get your first client fast? I would do work for free and I would put my stuff everywhere until I get in and then I know kids are getting a [ __ ] ton of clients. They have no clue about design by the way if any of your viewers shill. No thanks. Uh I'm currently growing a BTOC bisop offer that teaches remote appointment setting to 9to5ers through a course, onetoone coaching model, and placement help. Okay, so you have a course, you then onetoone coach them and you place them. Trying to crack the call funnel right now. running ads targeting employed people looking for an extra income stream. I've tested optins, Insta forms, and direct app, but most leads are coming in unqualified because they have low savings and cost per booking is around current currently spending $100 a day. So, you're getting two a day. I'm considering testing an AI angle where our I don't know why I said AI like that. Uh where our in-house AI does most of the heavy lifting on DMs for them, reducing perceived effort, but not sure if it's going to over complicate the message. Couple of quick questions. I'd love your take on you think the AI angle. So when you're saying AI angle, you mean like so you're just instead of having a setter, it's AI. So it's not like a marketing angle. It's like a how you're talking to them. Or would it dilute the core offer? I don't know why. If it was just pretending to be a person as long as it's good, that's fine. Yeah, I could do heavy lifting on DM for them. Reducing perceived effort. Oh, for them. So okay. Well, I get what you're saying. So grow that teaches remote appointment setting to 9 to5. So someone is learning repo remote appointment setting. Yes, you can use AI as like an angle to be like this is how we do this thing. But like again that's how to do the job. Right here you're trying to even teach them what remote appointment setting is. So that's more of like a piece of the puzzle and like part of the mechanism not like what you're educating them on like what you're convert like what you're teaching them to do. So, no, I don't think it would dilute the core offer, but I don't think it's like you could layer it in. So, it's like how to become a a remote appointment setter that a I don't know. I don't know how to do that right now, but like that does, you know, some XYZ through AI because you're teaching them like here's what you're going to become and here's this crazy mechanism on how you do it and like that your USP on how you do it. Uh, what price point would you recommend? I have no idea. Um, I have no idea. But I mean, you're saying all these people have low savings. So to come up to this, direct to app is probably best for this, especially if you're not if you want like people on your calendar um for cost per book call. Clearly the messaging and your and your targeting and everything is getting people very low savings so people can't afford it. So how you do the pricing is like what's the value, right? So like if someone's going to go and all of a sudden like setters make like three five grand a month, right? Like or more. I mean, I've heard people make eight and whatever, but like call it five. So, what is it worth to learn how to make 60 grand a year if they're already making 60 grand a year or whatever, right? But now they get to do it remote and this can that. Is it 2500 bucks? Is it 5,000? Like any of those are over the phone anyway. So, I have five to six results screenshots. How do I speedrun through more case studies? get a bunch more people at lower price point if you really want to like actually test this, but that's not going to prove that you can sell at that price obviously because you're doing that. But like if you're just doing it for case studies, you're I feel like you're just like there's different things going on here. So AI could angle could convert better. Yes. Layering it into the USP up here of how to do it. That's not going to solve for getting more qualified people though. So the qualified people is how you're targeting and what your messaging is saying up here. Okay? And what the offer is. Once you have the offer in there dialed in, layer in that AI and go into the offer. Cool. No, it will not dilute it. Price point, I don't know, 2500, 5,000. I don't know what the market asks for this. I don't know what other people sell this for. Um, I think Cole has one that does it. Cole crushes and like owns this domain right now. Um, I have five to six solid results from previous clients. How do you get more case studies? I always go with the lower like what's the the lowest hanging fruit on how to do this is like literally if you want to go crazy, do it for free. like literally pay people like if you're trying to just solve for this, if you're trying to solve for the whole thing in one, you speedrun it by actually getting this to work so that you do get real results and then that people then you can use it. So hopefully that was helpful. Sorry, a little confusing. Any tips for getting over fear whether mind for launching a new offer whether mindset or tactical tips feels a lot different than taking organic face who's already been trust and teach and launching them to cold. obviously having backend dialed in but struggling to stop researching more setups. No, just launch it. Absolutely. Just launch it. Um but go low budgets. Like I have a great example of this the other day. Launch something. Um I was talking to a group and they were like, "Yeah, blah blah blah. Like how do you want to do this?" And I was like, "Yeah, like three three to 500 bucks a day, which should be XYZ." And they had all these ads and all this stuff done and they launched at three to five grand a day. and tech is breaking and messaging isn't hitting and cost per call is like in the like thousand plus and I'm like what is going on like why are we doing this like we need to me like we need to run this at a lower budget so I would just do that I would just run at a lower budget especially if you're saying you have organic when you do retargeting or like run an ASC campaign or whatever and it picks up cold and and uh warm like one your stats are going to be like puffed up right off the rip because you are going to be hitting people that already see your face. When you're truly getting into cold, that's when you're like spending into pockets that you haven't even hit yet. So, starting at low budgets is like the triple safe way to do this because you're likely going to land on retargeting people and you're not spending that much money and they've already seen your f and and and uh and then as it begins to scale up, your stats very likely will decrease, right? Um or more so like your results will decrease, your costs will go up. And when doing that, you can then more or less like tweak it real time and see what you need to change for cold and see how your math backs out. Like right here, having your back end dialed, knowing your numbers. Um, so yeah, I think this is I mean you're you're good. Just launch them. Just launch them at low. Do 30, 50 bucks a day. Do 100 bucks a day. Do something like that. And then start to see the cadence, start to see the stats. uh have them on dedicated pages so you have dedicated data because you don't want it to mix with organic or you're going to like again puff up your data more and think it's like crushing even if it's directly not. Um so yeah, just set up it itself dedicated. Does this funnel make sense? Uh would you change anything? I'm launching a paid community hosted on school specifically for beginners in business. What kind of business goes into business psychology, marketing, sales, product offer development, biohacking and selfmastery all structured from two years. all structured from over two years of focused work and refinement. Right now, I'm only active on Twitter, but I have a Telegram channel. You have two assets. For the past year, I've been dropping two to three voice notes a week to build trust, over value, and warm my audience. When I launch, I'm personally DMing every every member, and I'll send them a 30 to minute 30 to 60 minute community thesis video that breaks down the vision, the transformation, the structure of the offer. I like these a lot, by the way. I like when people just give the offer. Um 30 to 60 is kind of crazy. Like, you could do it in like 7 to 12 minutes is what this like. I see a lot of people do that. So, it's like literally here's what you're going to get. Here's what the breakdown is. Here's why I'm launching it here. Here's my experience. Here's like what the offer is. Click here, book a call or buy right here or do whatever. Um 30 to 60 is like generally for someone who doesn't have the consumption of x amount of years like you're saying or however much content uh or consumption that they've already had with you. This is like VSSL webinar land where you're like hard selling someone on something. So, um from there, I'll qualify and sell via DM with an option to jump on a quick call. Did you say price on here? Yeah, I'm pricing the community at 997. 997 is low enough that you can sell it direct without having to talk on the phone, but I love talking on the phone because you can like change the offer. You can sell someone thing for 10K. You can sell something for 50K. You could sell something for 500 bucks. Like you get to it's more malleable when it's on the phone. But you're going all in on YouTube with Telegram is the only CTA. I'll be pitching community inside Telegram. Um I don't really necessarily understand who your target is other than just like general beginners. Um the issue with that is like not having a specific result is very difficult. So within serious beginners who know who don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing yet but are hungry to change that. Yeah. So the biggest issue with I think with beginners is like yes cool. You like want this foundational stuff. A lot of time you can learn this through doing a specific thing though. And when you're not selling a specific outcome, it's like you're going to tell them it's $1,000, I assume, for lifetime access to the community with all of these courses in them. And it's like for what? Like what are they paying $1,000 for? Oh, all these things. But like what's the outcomes? Like they're going to be a better business person, but they have no experience as a business person. Like you're not teaching them based on this a specific thing. Then you probably have that in your community thesis. It's like this is how I'm going to teach you to get to your first 10K or whatever. I don't know. I don't do MMO. I don't do beginners. I don't know how that works. U as well. But like generally speaking, that's why you see everyone be like how to get to your first 10K through this method and whatever that they've never heard of PDF farming or drop shipping or whatever. Um versus like here's how you become a business person, an online business person by the sounds of this. Like that's what I see as the biggest issue here. And then same thing with this, like if you already have a warm audience, like you can beta, you can talk to people on the phone. I do like talking to people. I like the idea of talking to people on the phone. Um, but yeah, I hope that kind of makes sense. Best channels to reach small to medium-siz businesses, brickandmortar, any business that uses a payment terminal like a square or a toast as an agency. So if that's as an agency, been struggling to scale um past familiar connections and referrals. Referrals are hot. I know a guy that does a referral like partnership business that does 110 million a year strictly from referrals um in a similarish style thing here. Um so there's a lot of payment guys on X that could probably help you a lot better than me. Um but in just generally speaking if you're like I need some I need physical inperson brickandmortar businesses that have payment terminals like where do they hang out? What events do they go to? Who's already dominating the pay uh the the space? And then if you have some unique thing then using whatever on LinkedIn or Facebook ads or whatever where you can target this like business like brick and mortar you can target pretty easily on LinkedIn. You can have organic around this like I don't know what the offer is if it's just like hey change off square and toast that they have their entire business like integrated with and do it for cheaper fees and like that's the only thing like a little bit harder of a sale. But if you have like this it's like an offer. It's like what's the offer? It's like, "Oh, I'm going to come in. We're going to implement a marketing system and do payment terminals and save you money here, here, here, and here, and the average business saves over 30 grand a year and fees and whatever." Like, and you have a payment calculator that this is how much you'll save, and this is how much will increase this or we have some ascension portal thing. Like I, you know, I don't know what the offer is, but like you just need a good offer and you need to get it in front of the right eyes, which is cold, which is paid, which is uh outbound, which is [ __ ] trade shows, which is referrals. So, you need the core offer and then you need multiple sources. Or I mean, you don't even need multiple sources. You just need one that you crush with and then you can have multiple. But you just need to find what pocket that is and then start with coming up with the offer that actually converts when people hear it. So what are the best strategies for improving ascension rate with low ticket ascension funnels? Um so I talked about this on the front. So the strategies are fundamentally the core of it being in congruency with what you're ascending them into. So if you sold like here's how to make your first 10K and then over here it's like here's how you do like basket weaving like I think that's what it's called. Uh that doesn't ascend. Like that doesn't make sense, right? So, versus like if you have basket weaving as your high ticket and I'll teach you exactly how to do it and I'll fly out and I'll be there side by side until you get it right. And then over here it's like how to make your first sweater or basket or whatever the [ __ ] I don't know what I'm talking about. Uh those are in congruency. It makes sense that this and then this is the next continuation of it. Agencies that sell here's how to get more clients and whatever they get in you have an ascension or you have a onboarding call. call. They get on the onboarding call where you talk about what's going on here and you're like, "Oh, also we'll do this with you or coach you on how to do this or do it for you and it's 10K instead of 1K and then it's a take rate." Watch the video on my channel with Brooke. They sell a course on this or uh they have the flow like this for high ticket USbased drop shipping and they sell a course direct through a webinar funnel. It's like a one or two ticket. They get an onboarding call and they sell, you know, 40% of them ascend into their five or 10 or 50 or whatever K offer. um that's basically just done with you or done for you. So the big thing is it's directly in alignment. It's just more implementation. It's more um it's the continuation of what it is is the number one thing. And then all the actual like little mechanisms within there is just like squeezing it. So making sure that if you have a tube step that you have a lead and then a buyer, it's like what are you hitting the lead not buyers with in in contacts and flows and uh setters once they're a buyer but they haven't booked their onboarding call. What are you doing to optimize to get them to book an onboarding call? Once they don't show, what are you doing for show rates of the of the onboarding call? Once they're on the onboarding call, what's the conversion rate? What can the scripting be and the qualification be? If the people aren't qualified, go back to the front end and change up the marketing feedback loop to make sure or give feedback to marketing to make sure that the people coming in who are buying the low ticket are somebody who will and can ascend into the high ticket. Uh once they're inside the low ticket, make sure that it's completely optimized for uh consumption and ascension. So it has book a call, it has application links, it has whatever inside there. Make sure that they're getting in a community and you're commu and putting value inside the community. And like all of those things contribute to the ascension rate. It's not just like, oh, they bought and then five like whatever percent ascend, 4% ascend, 12% ascend. I was talking to Ravi on his he has like a 13% ascension rate which crushes because there's all this value and then all these people are people who are interested in XYZ thing and the implementation of it is the ascension. So, it just makes sense for people to ascend. And because the quality of the product is so good, because the touch points are there, they ascend. So, it's like you almost like feed them the first thing and then they're ready for the next thing. Uh, and the next thing is your next program. So, hopefully that helps. Most influential realizations you had as a byproduct of wasting time and energy on BS. Um, most influential realizations. Yeah, I wasted eight a lot of years being an idiot. Um, is the biggest one. So, I just know how much output and like product. Sorry, Mike. Uh, I know how much output and potential in that direction I can have. Um, and I was just wasting it just straight up like just straight up wasting the time and energy on dumb stuff. Um, people in life, me, it was just me. I don't even blame any like there's no blame around it other than me. Um, so I just wasted Yeah. a lot of time in that. Uh, marketing, sales, ops, and scaling specific. um not understanding the economics of things and the numbers even though like I did but I didn't fully and like even right now I'm like oh yeah I understand it but I but I don't understand 90% of it then it's a constantly you know constantly learning new things and implementing new things to then learn the next thing and skill stack is like my number one thing so with sales we let it run for a very long time uh at what without any comparisons and knowing what it should be for the costs uh or for like conversion so like simple examples like oh if our close rates 15% and we're making money and we're like, "Oh, this is great." But like industry average is 30%. And like we didn't know that, let's just say. Or like ops like um not having project management systems in place or being okay with due dates being a week out because that was just the norm and we were all just like lifestyle businessing it when it could have been done same day or next day. Scaling, leaning in for vanity metrics that were like topline numbers and burning profit. And I talk about that and like how we have this overhead stack and we built to be this like 5 million plus a month company. So when you do 1.5 or 3 million a month or whatever like the margin's not there because the margin is released once it gets up there. And um understanding what the big levers are in team efficiency and in the economics of the front end and the economics of the back end. Like even now we like have not focused on LTV up until like months a couple months ago and it was like it's the most profitable part of the company and just like not understanding the numbers or not understanding the overall like business like we have made literally every mistake and are probably going to make a lot lot lot more um but like actually iterating through those. So hopefully that was helpful. But uh how would you make your first 15,000? You only have $500 and your goal is to do in in three months. learn a service, sell it for 5Gs, do three of them. So, anything from like what's hot now. So, like you can deploy um you know, use something sexy like AI, but what are you actually selling them? AI is how you're doing it, but which makes it like cool. Like the other one I talked about up here, like the USP makes it cooler. Um but what you're teaching or what you're helping a business do is like get more clients or do XYZ. um you know, we'll run your Facebook ads for you for free and once you get your first, you know, once you collect 15,000, we get our you know, we start a 5k retainer and then it's like hammer it and like create a really good offer, sell it to people, lowest barriers, performance-based generally. So, nothing upfront and then do that. You get, you know, five, 10, whatever of those in three months and then you have those three months to actually perform on the service. Once you perform on the service, you get the actual performance fees and that's your 15 GS. Like, I would do something like that. Um, it's usually the easiest because it's like you need a good enough offer that people are willing and you can get enough volume into it or you need to snipe somebody and just do one for example. But that's probably honestly the the cleanest way to do it is you land one that you know you can do it with for free that is I you know you have a 15k performance model um that you can get paid 15 grand over three months whether it's 5k a month or 15 gs after or whatever and then you perform for them. Um, and if you don't trust yourself in the skill, then yeah, I would hedge it a little bit and probably have a couple of them, but you're going to have a less likelihood to make them all achieved than just one of them. So, um, another one actually, uh, is like if you want to just work as a job and get paid for it. So, like setting you could do you could be a crush it as a setter and make 5gs a month. So, you could do it as a job um, and you get paid to learn it. You're inside a company that already has lead flow and all the things. You don't have to do it from scratch. Um, that's a really good entry point is like setting into closing. Some people take closers off the rip where it's more normal to make 10K a month, but um, it's harder to land a a closer job just off the RIP. Can you talk more about the offers you ran when you sold mid to low ticket or mid, sorry, mid-tour products? How was the offer structured and what strategy do you use to close on sales calls for things like bonus scarcity? Um, yeah, so we sold we initially sold it for $500 over the phone or I think it was actually $4.95. Um, and then it's the same product. We just increased the price to a,000 and then up to 14.95. There are some paid plans that were in-house as well. Um, majority of them were sold at scale at this 145 price. And it was just the classic info coaching model. So, it was lifetime access, which was silly, um, but clearly easier to convert. And it was uh, course access, a Facebook community, and group coaching calls like three times a week and where they could submit forms and go through all those questions. So, that's how the offer was structured. uh what did you use to uh sell on the call? Just the value of what it was. Also, all of our sales reps were um all of our sales reps were clients of the product, so it was extremely easy to sell. Um we just had to teach them a little bit of sales skills, but like it was very easy to have someone that was the exact same market demo and talking about how they had already bought it and the changes they had made and had just really good results. So, it was kind of like an easy feedback loop. Um you're trying to create an info product. I'm considering designing an offer sim similar to his OG launch where it's framed at 59 deposit that's refunded credit it to ascension when they complete the challenge. I have result-based intro version of my info product. I'm thinking about using the same free challenge offer model but not sure if it's better to just sell the info product directly on calls instead of with a free challenge. No. So the idea of the free challenge is this is Hormos's whole offer idea. Right. So, you're going to get more volume of people that come in through this than if you were to sell it directly at this $4.95. Um, so if you do the free challenge, the idea is you have more volume that that come through. It's a sexier offer. You get a higher click rate, you get a higher take rate, you get a higher join rate, and then inside there when fulfilling on it, you get a higher ascension and higher take rate. So, it's all about like lowering the friction, increasing the conversions, and getting more throughput through it. So that's why these are generally like structured like this is because if you have this free versus if you have just lose this and this and then sell it direct like the clicks on this for example is going to be double what it would be if you were like for like you know think in the other extreme but it's like uh lose 20 pounds for for $500 or whatever and it's like I maybe that is a good offer but like you have to test these different things. Um but that's the idea behind it is like the offer is good enough that it gets a higher throughput. Um, and then you have people in your ecosystem and then they consume and then they're interested and as long as you have good product and good XYZ and good like optimizations, they ascend through um, your range. Picking an offer and market. What's one market principle most people overlook but separates those who scale who are stuck at 10K. 10K a month is um, you can do a lot more than that just like with any offer in any market. Um, marketing principle that most people overlook. I guess probably the same as the last question. It's like making a good enough offer because one offer, one traffic source, one whatever is like easily how to get to hundreds of thousands a month is with one offer and one source. Whether that's organic, whether that's paid, whether that's YouTube, whatever. I mean, whatever it is, referrals, like you just have to have a good enough product, a good enough offer, and a good enough product that it works for. Um, so what's one marketing principle? Most people overlook that that it just all comes down to what that offer is. Um, and if it's good enough, then you're good. So, I would say that's kind of the biggest issue directly. Um, you seem to have scaled without much organic. How would you be able to build trust fast without organic? You talked about the value. How does that look? Uh, any channels you recommend on this specific topic? Thanks. Keep up the volume, watching every vid. Thanks, G. Um yeah, we have a ton of organic that exists as middle middle and bottom of funnel just not as like first click. So we don't have like first click attribution to they saw us on on organic first and I that's also because we pay so much so it's like um yeah it just like inherently happens. Uh how are you able to build trust fast uh with mass amounts of content and consumption? So we email twice a day. We have contextual flows. We have an intense amount of content that they can consume in multiple fashions. So we have YouTube video, we have audio podcast, we have paid VSSLs, we have free products they can consume, we have paid low ticket product they can consume. We have different ways that like depending on their mode of their type that they're interested in, you know, through whether it's a free training, whether it's just, you know, a catalog of videos, whether it's a free product, whether it's whatever they enter through there and they consume and consume and consume. We have community, a free community, we have like all these different ones. So that's what the value vortex really is. It's m value vortex is more so multiple paid entry points. Uh we did 71 million through one paid funnel type. So like not to say you can't do it with just one. Now having value vortex, we can just see that people enter this funnel and then later they enter this funnel and they come through. And because those funnels are built in a way that's conversion focused, that's why they have like so much throughput versus like if you just had one funnel and then a bunch of content, you're just hoping that the content brings them back to do it versus when you're paying and having multiple funnels on the front. They're all kind of conversion focused. You squeeze it more is the general idea. Is there any reason why you don't partner with personalized supplements company, ecom brands, or have another product in the health and wellness niche or build your own? Maybe you do, just haven't heard you mention it. Yeah, that's in progress. Uh, we had a partnership last year where I was not paying attention when someone on the team made the partnership. It sounded rosy. I just didn't do the math on it and we got railed. We lost like literally cash over a million dollars in the partnership um because we were basically paying for XYZ for clients that were coming in to be basically enrolled in this other like partnership company and then they were going to sell them supplements and this and this and this and then we were going to get MR and like this big commission stack and all this stuff and the funnel was just broken. The funnel was just absolutely broken. So like simple math is we were paying like call it 250 bucks for someone to enroll in this. So that was directly out of the margin because we weren't charging more for it. So it was like right off the rip we were paying out of pocket and then like the conversion rate of that funnel of like how many people then sent the thing back and then how many people then got on the first call and then of the first call uh how many people went to the second closer call and then of the second closer call how many people actually bought and then once they bought we got you know 50% commission and like you do the math down and there was no way we were going to make the money back. I just like never looked at the math like I'm an idiot. Like never looked at the math correctly. Uh, and I also didn't have the numbers because they couldn't produce the numbers for me. So, like good business over there, but like not good for the amount of volume that we were pushing to them and the conversion rate rates and like mechanism they were using. Um, so yeah, now we're just going to do it in house. Uh, we care about brand a lot. We care about quality a lot. So, it is taking us a little bit longer and again, like I said, we're a little bit more corporate in this. Um, but this will be soon. Um, and I also didn't want to lose focus on the info coaching piece because it's like as soon as you layer this on, it's like, yeah, it's more LTV or it's more of this or that, but I'm like, okay, how do we build this so it has equity value? How do we roll it out the correct way? And then how do we not lose focus on the main thing, which is the entry points of the info coaching to then also have this. So, I just didn't want to I didn't want to confuse everyone. So, we kept saying we're like, oh, at 5 million a month, at 5 million a month, we'll do it. Um, but we are moving on it now. Now that we have team that's fully running specific things that we can kind of like isolate it over in its own section without it like affecting the rest of the team. So if you had a goal to make 100k in profit by end of year when is it July 20th? How would you go uh with the option of creating your own YouTube channel around trading niche provided you have good knowledge and running and running? How would you go with the option of creating and running traffic to a broker offer or starting a growth operating agency? Um, these guys crush people who are like actually good. Ahmed talks about this. He picks out Black Swans. Um but basically they have organic YouTube channels and they run them not to traffic broker offer but to their own communities. So they have MR and then they also have ascension through like education. Um trading offers are basically flipped which I think is super cool. A lot of the time people sell um do-it-yourself done with you and then done for you. And that's like the offer stack and also the pricing stack. So like you pay a,000 bucks, you pay 10 grand, you pay like 50 grand for the person to teach you, right? um or the person to do it for you, I'm sorry, or for it to be done for you. Trading is the other way around. Trading is like you pay a low ticket amount to basically get signals and join the community and get all the stuff done for you and then the the education and the access is then the other way around. So like the top tier is learning how to do it on your own versus normal models of the other way which I find very interesting. Um but yeah, they use YouTube organic, they build up this big audience on organic on multiple channels. um they provide a ton of value and then people just convert into the low ticket and then low ticket has uh or recurring low ticket and then the recurring low ticket then has different monetization plays like you said your traffic to broker offer I assume is like another monetization model so you can give like affiliates to different trading programs and stuff like that um and then starting your own growth operating agency I don't know how that works really I mean like I I don't know how you do that at at scale without the skills um but yeah you can make 100k if you crank it with one client as a growth operator agency thing. I mean, you just need to be have a partner to do that. You don't need 12 to make 100K. You need one. So, that one's probably, but that's less of uh I don't know actually. I mean, I don't know. I don't have direct I mean, I guess I do have direct experience doing it, but I've never done it in an agency capacity. So, uh if you can lean in, get a good deal, have a business model that's actually scalable with a good product, a good partner, a good expert, and all that, then yeah, it does make sense. um but you own the business on this other side that you likely don't in the growth operating. So when you have like a YouTube channel around trading for example like you would own that if you were the person or maybe these are two and the same where you're doing both. But uh business model choice uh info coaching great margins if you do it with organic and you do it with a high LTV game um a full-on business can hit exit velocity can get large. Um, I like that. If you're like a beginner and you don't have anything that you can info coach, then you need to partner with somebody about it because it's the worst thing in the world when someone sells [ __ ] they don't understand or are trying to just they sell how to make money to make money. It's like the most bogus [ __ ] ever. Um, so yeah, either doing this growth agency one or service based. So just sell service, learn a skill, get paid to learn a skill on a job somewhere and then offer as a service. Do not teach how to do it because you still don't know how to do it. Um, so I do that. send follow-ups forever or stop at a certain point. Buy or die. Um, just kidding. But yeah, no, we send follow-ups forever. So, we send two emails a day in contextual flow. So, if someone comes in on this place then and doesn't get to the next action, then it's, you know, you opted but you didn't apply tons of emails that are contextual and then we're sending two a day every day uh around content and around different messaging pockets and and all that kind of stuff. Uh, and then now also layering in like I talked about the value vortex, different consumption methods versus just always sending them to like a video or an audio. Uh, we'll send them to low ticket, we'll send them to like a free training around this messaging pocket or this. Um, so yeah, as long as you're mixing it up and then providing value more so than just constantly trying to hit them with sales. Um, yeah, you can send a lot of emails so forever. Uh, I run a software that does 50,000 in MR. Nice. And just added a high ticket version so I can run ads. I've taken 25 sales calls, 80. Okay, great stats. 80% show up and 40% close. When to hire a closer, and how to onboard them because I'm a marketer person, introvert, not a sales guy. Right now, hire them right now and hire two of them so you can see who's actually good. Um, you just need to make sure you have the flow for them or that they're hybrid and that they're and that they're hitting the, you know, low ticket current MR people and trying to ascend them into high ticket. Uh, or whatever this offer is that you're selling that then Trojan I don't have enough context, but if you're like Trojan horse selling an info offer or whatever that then people use the software like you can scale that into it. It's just its whole own uh, you know, funnel and whole own marketing channel. So, you just need to make sure you focus on it and that there's enough volume for two people. Um, but yeah, I mean, you're booking out 48 hours. Uh, a rep can take, you know, eight calls a day. You have 20 calls a day or whatever. That's two reps call it roughly. I mean, just depends. But yeah, get out of it if you're the marketing person, the introvert, and have two people who do it and have them commission only 10% and just rip it. And then again, have them do both. Have them be full stack because if you have 50k in MR, you likely have people they can right now hit up and then ascend. Uh, how do you stay inspired after reaching goals and milestones of feeling lost and empty after achieving a lot of goals? Um, I don't know the answer to that. Um, mine has changed again for the goal is progression and right now is the time and in the future it'll still be right now. And um, yeah, I mean set bigger goals. Do it for different reasons. What is the actual why in in which you're doing it? I'm not the best person to really talk about this with. I get like fulfillment through being busy at some level which is not necessarily the best thing but um I do achieve those goals and milestones throughout that and I get it out of the progression the growth the number on a screen the like doing all that kind of stuff um because it's fun to me and we learn new things and we launch new things and we hit new goals within there and CPA needs to get at this point what are the levers we need to pull and like what is the problem we need to solve in the end is really what it is is like what's the problem or what's the thing like we can solve there's like solving [ __ ] like that. Um, so I focus on that and then yeah, of course they then have results that come out of there or cash that pops out of there that are maybe milestones or tangible things. Um, I made a post on X about this the other day, but talking about like the, you know, like I live in my space, for example. I'm I'm 95% of the time like I don't leave. So like it's important to me to have a really nice space. So like why wouldn't I set that as a goal to have like the perfect thing that I exactly desire and want and like what I enjoy out of it or a space that can hold x amount of people is like a thing Robbie talked about because one of his goals is to have you know um four or five like couples always and family and this kind of stuff. So, he needs a big space and like you can't do that without achieving these certain things and having the cash to do it or having the XYZ. Um, and yeah, just like thinking bigger in that way. Um, because anybody can live and is okay with a really, you know, a cool nice one-bedroom apartment, a nice car and, you know, 20,000 in cash flow beyond that. Let's just say like, you know, that's fine. You're living fine, but like or you're good. But if everything went to zero tomorrow, like, do you have enough cash that you'd be fine forever? Unlikely. um is like there's just a lot of that. Can you provide to the things around you? Do you have XYZ in spiritual or philanthropic or whatever? Uh like stuff like that. Like that is where it starts to stretch. Again, I'm probably not the best person to answer this because I don't want to say that I feel lost and empty by any means, but like you know, we just hit record months and like I feel nothing. Um because I have like a mental number and goal and things that are like, okay, cool. Once we're at that, like it'll feel more real, but I already know like once it's that it's like then this next one, this next one. So it's more for me about like what's the actual lifestyle um what is the internal self-t talk around these things how do you become you know undeniable in XYZ way like I have certain things that are important to me and that I think are important to what then influences the people around me or what I can provide then for the people around me as well um that sure come back to these goals and milestones but yeah hopefully that's helpful that's what I got guys uh I don't have a daily update for you I don't do these every day anymore so Rolodex has some things if you're interested. There's like softwares and tech vendors and sales agency vendors and stuff like that that I use. Um so that um I have all the videos here. All the videos are on this right here. So Ryan Clark, make sure you do the www um and get to the dock. And yeah, that's what I got. So appreciate you guys. Uh today's the 20th. We are on pace for record month. Um but we will see. We did a big renewal special. So the big goal here is to make sure that all of it is new acquisition, not just current. Current's amazing and renewals are amazing because they're extremely high margin and it's great. Um, but we also want the front engine of the business producing much larger numbers than it is and we have a lot to work on to do so. So I am in the trenches. We're working and appreciate you guys and we'll talk soon. 45 minutes. Comment 45 if you made it to the end. Bye guys.
