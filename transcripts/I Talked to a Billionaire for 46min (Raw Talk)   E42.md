# I Talked to a Billionaire for 46min (Raw Talk)  | E42
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7dVc9dqX3A

cool we recording now we are awesome man so 
I randomly hit you up on Twitter because our   friends were talking to each other and I thought 
it would be cool to hop on in Zoom and talk about   what you do see if we can pull some value out 
i really love all the books in your background   i'm curious is this like Tai Lopez style where you 
may have not read them or No no no i have in fact   I've read like the joke is I've read like 80% of 
them and then the bottom ones like I've had these   I started this when I was like 16 i'm 28 now but 
I literally have moved all over the US and I've   brought them every time and it's like the hardest 
part of moving so I bring them and they just keep   stacking but the bottom 20% is like the classic 
Amazon grab it send it to the door add it to the   shelf and it has just died there so my consumption 
of books has dramatically decreased i'm so much   more audible and podcast now so much more which is 
like I'm not a huge fan of actually like I think   I should get back into it because I've learned a 
lot from those yeah it's funny you say that like   I spent all of my 20s reading physical books and 
a good portion of my 30s and I also moved around   i moved around generally every year for over 
a decade like different cities yeah and same   problem moving the books and I did it for a long 
time when I moved to Miami uh I got rid of all of   them except my like old psychology books so my my 
bookshelf is like all psychology books from the   1930s 40s 50s and 60s like the source material 
exactly the original i think I've got a I think   I've got an OG Think You Grow Rich hell yes i have 
like a OG OG which is hilarious because I actually   I opened it the other day and my first thing into 
business was trying to do like private equity   style stuff i like dropped out of college i went 
to ASU and the bookmark I had in here was from a   uh like jeweler in Newport cuz I moved to Newport 
and tried to like figure that out i had no idea   what I was doing it was like true ignorance is 
bliss we were trying to what I now know is like   a roll up we were trying to roll up a bunch of 
like alternative finance or alternative fitness   locations physical locations we got like 14 under 
LOI we rented a Tahoe drove around the US hit   everyone on LinkedIn got franchise or approval 
like did all this stuff and at the end I was   going to make a deal closing fee like as like 
an independent sponsor so it was me a business   partner and an attorney it was us three because 
he obviously a lot of legal work and I wanted to   buy an AP at the end of it and it is AP Royal 
Oak Black Dial Auto and it's like the tax it's   them financing it it's like a full breakdown and 
I found it the other day when I grabbed this book   and it's like hilarious but it's like it's just 
like h just funny stuff like that wait a second   financing it tell me you didn't finance the watch 
i didn't finance it no no i'm saying when I was   18 years old trying to do this I did that no no 
no i did not finance this but it's just like it's   funny this is like the watch I wanted as an idea 
yeah yeah do not finance finance watches yeah just   like funny it's like just things so back to like 
the psychology part of it and all that it's like   those are the core books in here anything like 
skill oriented or yeah I mean on all of that is   either I've learned through courses I'm a course 
junkie I have paid for guru course mastermind like   everything you can imagine and either then taken 
pieces and parts of that and then really learned   it by applying it and like learning what we by 
breaking things and running it active but yeah   so like skills there mindset frameworks all that 
kind of stuff books car that's super cool like I   you know my backstory is is a little crazy but 
um at one point I had started my first physical   business and you know I'm turning 41 in a couple 
weeks so when I started we didn't have iPhones we   didn't have eBay even like we didn't have anything 
and um I ended up going all the way down to North   Carolina i found a warehouse that had store 
returned liquidations and they were aggregating   all the store returns from Harbor Freight tools 
and selling them uh as salvage by the truckload   so full full 53 foot semi full of tools it's 
like 65,000 pounds of truckload it's crazy and   then eBay started and I bought a truckload risked 
everything I had got it up to Michigan and started   selling it on eBay and then got crushed when they 
implemented feedback so yeah the feedback system   was new and there were no rules and they were 
trigger happy and all this crazy stuff and so   that business failed miserably i lost everything 
in Michigan uh Metro Detroit okay yeah that's   where I am right now oh cool really that's where 
you ended up where yeah well okay so yeah long   story but that's where I'm from initially is 
like around Ann Arbor call it like in that area   and then went to Arizona for college that I was 
there for a semester lived in my dorm for a year   bounced around the Newport thing Chicago whatever 
and then last three were in Puerto Rico and then   when I ended the Puerto Rico gig I was like fam 
friends girlfriend thing like go back to Michigan   for now and now I got to figure out where to go 
because it's cold and I haven't done a winter too   long what's the actual city you're in uh right 
now Novi oh cool very cool yeah i grew up in   Rochester Hills and before I moved to Miami uh I 
was in Lake Angeles if you're familiar yeah yeah   yeah yeah it's hilarious wild uh and by the way 
please escape like it's Yeah oh no no i'm telling   you like that was my this was my first winter 
because I got back end of 2024 calendar year   like to finish out my days and then did a winter 
here and was like I mean I'm still doing a winter   here it's April and uh I'm like "Yeah I'm good i'm 
good on this." So Scottdale probably I have family   and friends there and there's a lot of networks 
so I think that's the spot yeah yeah yeah that's   good so I mean I picked Miami because my business 
partner was there it was a random choice but Miami   is great i just feel like it's a little too it's 
busy it's busy there's a lot of party availability   not like there's not in Scottsdale but like that 
kind of stuff and like I have I had that part of   my life and like I exited it whatever 10 12 months 
ago uh and I'm like I need to stay far away from   that like I ripped hard and I'm done doing that 
so well that's good miami yeah i I mean look on   the Miami thing I I went there but I'm older and 
you know first of all if you're if you're not   really successful do not move to Miami because 
you need a six-f figureure burn budget just to   go out to eat like oh yeah stupid and stupid um 
but I have hundreds of clients there and I didn't   know that and so my friend circle is customers 
like I generally meet people like I meet you   i don't go out to real world meet people generally 
that's it's um through friends with friends and so   when I got there I just started hanging out with 
my friends and I don't I like I have a Miami no   new friends rule like I I don't seek out people 
there um and I don't drink at all and so the   party scene just kind of I like the music so I go 
out for that but it doesn't affect me so but yeah   if you if you just got done with that do not move 
there because it's [ __ ] No I mean I was going to   say I just it's just done there's there's AP's 
lost because of that there's in Miami specific   there's just there's just rough times like just 
bad person overall you could just classify me as   as a bucket for a group of years there but um no 
I have a buddy that's from here that's a little   a little bit younger than you um but he has a 
physical ecom business where they have like a   China uh manufacturing setup and all this and it's 
like aftermarket parts and they're based out of   here but he spends six months in Miami and just 
loves it it's like the people the connects like   he just lives that life so he kind of does the 
what do they call it snowboarding but I don't know   sounds like a lot to me i like one place one spot 
one thing for that at least and then pop around   when you want to have fun it's tough in the summer 
there like I moved in the summer it's like living   in boil it's like living in boiling water so last 
year uh last year I took my girl to La Hoya and   then we went to Huntington Beach and then I had a 
bunch of trade shows and so uh we kind of escaped   the summer and this year we're going to escape 
the summer too um but you know healthy lifestyle   wise it's really an amazing place most fit city in 
the country when I moved back to Michigan I gained   a whole shitload of weight as you can imagine and 
then stay locked inside yeah i went to Miami lost   nearly 40 pounds and then uh I'm back up 15 
um and so it's been a good influence on me um   anyways real real quick but when I was 20 and that 
business failed Oh yeah sorry we derailed that   was my That was my bad we're in Michigan yeah the 
truckload the truckload business failed miserably   and I had to move back into my parents' basement 
i lost everything i lost my friends because they   worked for me by the way don't ever hire friends 
Twitter space like it's just don't just don't do   it yeah all this is targeted to Twitter by the 
way all of this content is strictly for Twitter   yeah yeah so like don't hire your friends don't 
buy inventory on credit cards when you have no   money like it's uh not smart don't go celebrate 
your first win by blowing all your your cash in   in Windsor partying with your friends like all 
all bad things yeah and so I moved back into my   parents' basement and I I effectively was lost and 
just had no idea what I was going to do had like   40 or $50,000 in credit card debt and investor 
debt and I was just ruined as a kid and it was   reading that really really changed my life um 
first I started reading about leadership which   made me realize that I sucked and needed to be 
much better uh about considering other people   and serving them and then I started reading about 
marketing and internet marketing and read a lot of   books on that and then that's what really pushed 
me to uh focus on marketing on the internet which   I discovered affiliate marketing and I went from 
negative $50,000 to essentially millionaire in a   very short period of time and never turned back 
so but it was it was books that saved my life   and I I think it's really cool that you read a 
lot and I know that most successful people that   uh I know read a ton and you know it's just a 
super powerful thing um speaking of which Yeah   I do wait is this you this is you is this you yeah 
yeah okay so no when I moved to Puerto Rico I did   not That was the only time I moved somewhere and 
didn't bring everything cuz when I first got down   there I was like I'm committing to three years but 
like I still don't kind of know yet i I'm going to   get a rental then I'll buy because of all like 
0% 4% game and like you have to buy to get that   one whatever um so I didn't bring all the books 
but I would buy them randomly and it would take   you know a two weeks to get a book anywhere or 
anything shipped depending on what you're buying   in Puerto Rico but yeah that this was one of 
the five or 10 books that I bought over that   time because again my reading and physical books 
has gone like this so over that last three years   it's only been a handful of books but yeah I 
uh I read this and what I actually did which   is hilarious i started to read this and was like I 
skimmed it and the reason I skimmed it is because   prior to that I sat in a cigar lounge and watched 
for two days the entire YouTube version yeah so   when I read this I was like not to say I already 
know it but like it was very framework driven on   like or you used a lot of the same like stories 
and paths and stuff and like I had literally just   watched that because I were Yeah like in in A to 
Z the entire thing that's so crazy bro that like   you and I have never met you have my book on your 
shelf and you you watched that crazy YouTube thing   that I did i think it was like six years ago how 
many hours is that it's 25 yeah no I watched the   entire thing yeah and I did it uh I did it in a 
couple weeks and uh did it all off of those slides   no single take no edits no anything just brain 
dump um and that was crazy how that changed our   business by the way when I released that it was 
like I think we had five people and including me   and my business partner and five team yeah total 
just and we were losing money um a lot because our   engineers are adtech engineers from California so 
they don't make 50k and now we have uh now we have   over a hundred people wow and I think a lot of 
it comes from giving away that knowledge in that   course it's so cool to hear people uh actually 
watch it i need to do another one yeah yeah i mean   I don't know i I obviously that's how I record all 
the stuff I make now is like that raw version i   don't have scripts i don't have anything like yes 
you eventually kind of like yap and ramble and go   in directions maybe that weren't expected but like 
as long as you know it or you know like they're   valuable i think it's helpful to do that and I 
think it's cleaner cut that way versus like some   chopped and perfect dialed in thing like there's 
a time and place for both right there's a time and   place but yeah no I was so I was in PR and I was 
going to a cigar lounge every single day and just   like post it up i would go I would go gym shower 
walk and that would be my walk and then I would   sit in a scar lounge and I have uh two buddies 
down there i had like very very limited friends   i was super even to this day like I live in this 
cave like I do this and this is the first time I'm   like posting on X and YouTube and like trying to 
make friends in the space more so cuz I was like   I don't have a lot of mutual interests with a lot 
of like normal people or you know what I mean like   in that like yeah the average person wants to do 
things with sports and this and that and like it's   just not where I sit and understanding like I just 
don't and like all the power to them it's just not   where like my interest lies so I was like "What 
if I did it the other way around and just tried to   find friends this way?" And you know 30 days in it 
is clearly working which I'm happy about but the   one like friend I had down there that actually was 
down there before I got down there and digitally   uh him and another guy do a ton through uh Ringba 
and so they're like ACA Medicare debt like big big   lead genen guys just two guy lean team and they 
are like they're rock stars like they've taught   me everything I know about the space they've 
taught me and I do a like I'll build a bunch   of tech stuff so I've been in your platform to do 
tons of different tech like I do their posts from   this to that and like storing stuff in air table 
and like passing back conversions and red track   back and forth like I've set a ton of stuff up in 
the platform for that um but I've never direct run   my own i've scaled some or ran some of theirs 
that I've been on um like you know we basically   can spend as much as possible on this we just need 
more eyes on ad accounts and I'm like yeah cool   i'll do it for a month it's like I've done that 
but that's the only thing I've ever directly done   in your guys' platform wild uh also by the way 
everybody this was not sponsored this is sponsored   uh this is not know my phone watch my course work 
with my customers i don't know who the Puerto   Rico people are yeah no he told me to talk about 
paper call masterclass book uh his YouTube series   and talk about his software i don't know it was 
weird uh actually I don't sell anything anymore   Ryan like I don't uh I don't you don't need to i 
don't purposely push that well what I what I want   to do and what's important to me is helping other 
people be successful and so that's why I started   tweeting i know that my personality is a little 
bit crazier more intense than most and raw and I   I don't care like that's authentic to me um but I 
really like to deliver value and that just draws   people in and and they can see what we're doing 
like Ringa's big enough that they can go "Oh who's   this Adam guy go find information and figure it 
out at this So I don't um I don't generally like   to sell or or push it i'm kind of like a mascot 
at this point but yeah um like you same thing i   started tweeting because one of my friends was 
tweeting and I thought it was funny jason Apple   Bum who I've known for over a decade and I don't 
know I just wanted to start to publicly engage   and I tried to do this on Instagram uh a couple 
years ago and you know I have like 7,000 followers   they're all industry or something but I can't drop 
knowledge on Instagram right like I can't what am   I going to do like I just I just post pictures and 
[ __ ] it doesn't do anything so I really like how   X does that um anyways I wanted to ask you about 
what you're doing that was the whole point of this   no no this is just open forum we're just here well 
I want to know though so um like like I was just   saying I really like to drop value to people i've 
been harassing Jason to do a course by the way if   you're watching you should tell Jason we should do 
a course on marketing or affiliate marketing you   guys should He's like "Oh I don't know paper call 
i don't want to talk about paper call." We don't   need to like let's just do affiliate marketing um 
or marketing or or business or or whatever Jason   so if anyone's watching this harass Jason tell 
him you want me and him to make a course we'll   give that [ __ ] away for free i don't even 
care it doesn't even need need to be money   but I have considered doing a paid course because 
I learned something super valuable about courses   and masterminds years ago and that was from going 
to one i'm not a course junkie like you i I never   thought to buy one um but what I learned from this 
mastermind that I paid to go to and I don't even   do ads anymore was I paid a lot more attention 
when I was there and I I I like really wanted to   connect with people to deliver value um to the 
group and I I made a lot of connections there   i had a great time i'm still really good friends 
with the people that I met there like uh I don't   know if you know Teddy Trung but I I met him there 
and now he's like a a great friend and a customer   and he had never run calls before and we just 
sat next to each other at this mastermind and   vived and next thing you know this guy's winning 
$10 million goat awards months later it was crazy   and um so by spending that money I was mentally 
committed to learning and doing something and so   I did give away the course you watched it i 
think that really motivated people watch it   and do something but the fact that it was free 
devalues the commitment from people and so you   sell information you know a lot about this 
like let's just do a case study right now   if Adam were to make a new course on paper call 
what what do I need to charge for that what is   the strategy around how it's built so then you can 
go market it like walk me through how you would do   it if you were me perfect transition so you saying 
bought bought a course valued it more met people   in it so I made a video about this like I bought 
every guru course and then we did this so when I   exploded that deal out in California I moved back 
to Michigan like tail between my legs and you know   wasn't in debt wasn't whatever it was all just 
time spent but was you know not good my dad has   a big landscape snow company i came back here i 
was you know living in my room my childhood room   basically so not the basement but you know doing 
that and just trying to like figure it out and at   that time was the first time I bought a course 
that I didn't know was a course i didn't know   anything about this industry and bought a course 
on like Instagram shoutouts and they were teaching   to do Instagram shoutouts you make a graphic you 
pay 200 bucks you're on some meme page or whatever   and then uh or like basically non-branded page 
then you that you pay for link in bio teaches you   how to create a lander that is an optin connected 
to I believe it was Aweber at the time they were   shilling and then going through Aweber and the 
thank you page was you literally just set the   redirect as a clickbank link and the idea being 
that it was going to selfquidate and then you just   owned this list and you could just market to them 
and do affiliate stuff and like that is my first   ever course and all that was right there didn't 
really go anywhere with it i did it in women's   fitness which is hilarious now full circle uh did 
it in women's fitness and didn't want to write as   like a fake as like a a fake persona as some like 
female fitness person and like market to this list   so I just stopped doing it and then tried ecom 
stuff messed around was kind just kind of like   working jobs figuring it out and then I bought 
consulting.com which was Sam Ovens i bought his   program the second one so the there there were 
three tranches so into your now let's go deep   into info here so a lot of the time it's these 
ascension style things especially in courses   it's like do-it-yourself done with you done for 
you or mastermind is like kind of like the core   common one so ovens had like the accelerator which 
was a direct to webinar so direct to cart so you'd   sell it through ads directly people could buy it 
on their own that was just a course with group   coaching or not even group coaching with coaching 
calls and then a community it's like course   materials coaching calls community the next one 
up from that was teaching you how once you got all   the acquisition dialed you now couldn't fulfill 
on them all so you need to learn how to productize   your service which was essentially how to become 
a guru and course builder and this was like you   know we we say OG but like obviously he wasn't OG 
of marketing he was like OG of this age this 2016   whatever time frame that was so at this time he's 
doing like 30 million a year too like he's doing   crazy numbers with this he bought consulting.com i 
bought that program very quickly learned I didn't   want to be a face and be the consultant and like 
pick a niche and do that whole thing the I help   X do by X like you know everyone's bio that's 
the classic from him and in that group a guy   posted in there and I was like oh that name looks 
kind of familiar go to his page and three minutes   prior he had posted like hey I have this company 
I will teach you know I'm trying to hire someone   that'll be my like right hand basically I want 
to teach them all things about marketing sales   and whatever online business I'm like okay apply 
for it get on the phone with him thickest thieves   next thing you know 70 million later like so I end 
up joining that company they're running a fit a   women's fitness app it's low ticket doing what was 
likely like was more so like now we're in like the   Brunson age of direct to cart and funnels and all 
that they were trying to run a low ticket app that   was $27 a 7-day free trial with $27 a month and 
then uh Otto of like 1671 147 for lifetime access   and just get those economics to work basically 
breaking even doing like 30K a month and I came   in and I was like building sales pages and like 
tweaking tech and just doing random stuff making   like a thousand bucks every six weeks fast forward 
COVID comes around i don't know if I'm allowed   to say that sorry if we just got everything 
bricked uh but come around to that and then   uh I think that's passed and then um it's X you 
can say whatever you want that's true we can just   write whatever words we want i don't know where 
this doesn't matter i can't even get my trouble on   X and uh true true and um yeah so he's like "How 
should we scale this thing to like 10 million?"   Because like you know we basically have done a 
million bucks in C in like in cash collected on   this low ticket thing but we're like not making 
much money at all like random 1K 2K 5K i'm just   like building pages in tech i'm like "Let's do 
a callunnel." He's like "All right let's do it."   So we buy another course that's like how to set 
up the CRM and everything i buy uh Alex Becker's   course at the time which he was selling like on 
the DL that was really a Trojan horse for Hyros   that was still scaling because he was like 
basically everyone who comes in here pay me   5 grand or 10 grand whatever the number was but 
like you all need to sign up for Hyros because   we need feedback like that kind of system so I get 
in there and that's VSSL script we use we used the   CRM system over this built it around that and we 
had already had a product that was an info product   to sell that was at the time we were selling it 
for $4.97 over the phone which is hilarious on the   economics now because you can't do that like very 
easily and then next thing you know 100k a month   then 300k a month then 500 800 million a month 
doing that for a little bit we're growing the   sales team i became an owner over this time so now 
it's us three owners because the two founders who   built it the expert fitness who's a rockstar and 
then the sales marketing focus guy as we scaled   I went tech ops systems he went marketing sales 
she went product expert and then we changed it   over from info which we increased pricing on but 
we changed it over from info to coaching and so   like annual recurring coaching onetoone with the 
coach and then we went to 3 million a month or 3.7   a month and then our acquisition exploded at the 
end of 24 2024 so that's where we're at now we're   kind of like back in the trenches 1.6 million 
last month not good for us because we have 10   and something employees now we moved everyone W2 
we're like a real business now yeah um so yeah   so a real business yeah a real business now dude 
we got we got an HR director we've got you know   we got Oh don't do that we do we do we need it 
we need it i just don't want to run payroll so   I was doing that for too long but yeah so we 
like built this thing in that way okay and I   always like to say this because it's like I like 
I like don't do well with the zero to one concept   i've never created anything right and like I think 
that's what I really like about lead genen or like   a or these other models where you're like scaling 
something that exists at some level like somebody   built the offer and then you're scaling it right 
or like generating sales for it versus creating   it from zero so like these guys did create it 
from zero he met her in a gym they built it up   they came up with the branding and the name the 
product market fit i came in we changed the model   that we were using and scaled the show of it right 
not we create so they created it I came in helped   scale it beside them and now we have taken it to 
71 almost 72 million in cash collected and our   target is there's two other guys in the space not 
like in the industry style that do over 10 million   a month with this exact model with this info 
coaching model nice so it's like let's do it so   that's the quick info background now the question 
the question is like Yeah well how do you price   it what do you do and how do you sell it yeah and 
then before we move on to that like your target is   what these other people have accomplished but the 
reality is your target should be much bigger than   that because if someone can do $10 million a month 
there's no reason why you can't do half a billion   correct yeah so just be and like you've got the 
other guys out there like there's some there's   some I always like to just road map it like oh if 
they use this model to get to this it's like cool   we can use this model to get to this and then it's 
like new frontier right so like back to that whole   like the framework's there so which obviously you 
are more the zero to one guy you're more in that   realm of like creation and you guys are software 
like mine's like what do you mean I see a model it   works to 10 million it's like run the gambit to 
get to 10 million and then it's like from there   we can see if it can take more or if it needs in 
addition like you know either whether horizontally   or vertically like what is the direction um 
but yeah there are guys in fitness space let's   just say that are doing hundreds of millions a 
year with low ticket a back high ticket backend   and some supplements like yeah the question the 
question you may want to ask yourself if I might   is how do you do 10 times more in onethird of 
the time right like okay my target is 10 million   a month well let's just say that my target is 50 
million a month instead and if I how do I think   about building to that from now and then how 
long is it going to take and then you figure   that out and then you ask yourself how do I do it 
in a third of the time and that thought exercise   will just naturally expand or remove any limiting 
beliefs you have around a milestone like that not   to say that the way you're thinking about it is 
wrong because it's not no no it's just a different   way to think about it i completely it's just a 
thought exercise of expansion and I think a lot of   entrepreneurs get get sort of stuck in their their 
ways and I do too it's it's you know you you're   trying to drive a business and you forget to take 
the step back and dream yeah and when I moved to   Miami a friend of mine a really good friend 
his name is Sam he owns an insurance company   uh called me and I was like in a rough place 
because uh I moved to Miami because my ex of 12   years wanted me to sell Ringba or hire a CEO stop 
traveling for work and I said no um so she left me   uh which was great in retrospect gift and an 
opportunity um but so I land in Miami and I'm   I'm kind of in a rough spot uh emotionally 
and my friend calls me and he checks up on   me regularly but instead he goes like "Hey who's 
your biggest competitor?" And you know I I tell   him for a couple different product lines who who 
that is you know like one's a public company one's   a venturebacked company worth you know uh couple 
billion bucks at this point and he's just like   "Why are you thinking so small?" And in one of the 
most vulnerable times in my life he like attacked   and challenged my my limiting beliefs when I 
wasn't able to defend myself yeah and I was   like "Well what do you what what like what what do 
you mean?" He's like "Who's who's the biggest adte   company that's involved in calls like who's the 
absolute biggest?" And I think about it and I'm   like "Well Google." He's like "Cool so what how do 
you beat them?" And I was like "What?" I I'm gonna   have to think about that and he's like "Yeah stop 
thinking so small." And I was like "Oh fuck." Yeah   like what the hell and what's crazy about that is 
in the next calendar year I more than doubled the   size of the business and added nine figures in 
enterprise value to what we were doing um just   like completely changed my thought process around 
what we're doing more than doubled the size of the   team made a lot of investments they say that they 
say that I'm trying to I think it was like a Dan   Sullivan book I want to say or maybe but like you 
know Cardone's got his whole 10x thing but it's   all like the gist is if you say okay we want to 
increase by 50% this year like list out all the   things we can do and you like have this list of 
like 15 things and then it's like now list out   we want to do 10x list out the things you can do 
and it's like cross out cross out cross out like   to get to 10 times the size you're not going to 
incrementally do this or this or this like you're   fundamentally shifting the belief the action like 
a complete new product line a complete new like   traffic source a complete like just fundamentally 
different and like so when you say that to us   that's instantly where my mind goes because like 
our constraint now if I want to add a zero on   a budget is like you know apps to booking so now 
you have sales team throttling and it's like right   there so like you would need to go direct to cart 
if you're going direct to cart what's the like   economic model that would work on that is it info 
is it subs is it like mid ticket is it what to be   able to do that and then you're capturing LTV with 
the other ones and it's like being able to come up   with that that's an interesting question how would 
we get to 50 million a month or whatever instead   of 10 it's like yeah that's interesting and in 
in our case it's software right and so you can   think about it from your lens which is like oh how 
do I build the offer how do I do this info ecom   yeah my my thought process shifted to something 
different and that is how do I expand the entire   industry pool right like and I was just like uh 
and that's where the book that's where the book   came yeah yeah like uh a lot of the the teaching 
and and I have to get much better at that that's   a crazy idea yeah how do I expand how many people 
are using paper call both on the vendor and on   side on both sides because then you just have if 
you have x percentage of market share you assume   you increase that but you also increase the total 
pie like that's interesting yeah like my thought   process is is how do how do I make every other 
company in the space that sells something like   I do more money yeah because if I grow the 
entire industry right the pool gets bigger   everyone else makes more money and I joke that uh 
I'm the best salesperson for all my competitors i   don't actually think I have competitors right 
like just me i compete against me but um like   that that's like I literally think about myself 
is how do I be the best marketer for everybody   else super interesting because that means that 
the pool has gotten so much bigger what do you   guys do for the other side so like the people who 
are buying more so right like cuz that I feel like   this is more so geared towards like this is where 
the industry is going this is it's expanding it's   going in this like here's how to do it from the 
media buy like kind of more on that side of things   versus like you know how are you what what do 
you guys do for like getting it normalized that   landscapers buy paper you know paper lead instead 
of doing or you just shift the marketers no it's a   it's a whole crazy sort of master plan side of 
that so book number two is about the buy side   it's how do small medium regional and even large 
scale businesses uh take advantage of uh consumer   initiated inbound calls paper call um and there's 
a lot to it and then uh what we also need to do   is we need to make it easy for the smaller scale 
and midsize companies to get their feet wet and to   get involved which is a really hard thing like how 
do you go to I don't know a regional landscaping   company that has 12 locations and services Metro 
Detroit only and get them to buy phone calls   like it's a concept that's foreign to them they 
may not have handle the phone calls and do all   that and then you got this call center yeah 
exactly and so like how do you deal with that   or small insurance offices that type of thing 
and so we realized that the number one question   I get asked at any trade show or any anywhere is 
how do I find more buyers right because a lot of   marketers are not business development people 
they're not um they're not like me right like   they're not going to go to a trade show open up a 
booth bring a sales team and like hustle and and   get customers like that it's just not their 
skill set right like it wasn't mine either i   had to learn it um and so that's why we launched 
Ringba X which is our programmatic call exchange   on the sell side basically any Ringba customer 
only can ping it uh and get a bid for their phone   calls right and so with that we are going to make 
a heavy push into doing the business developments   for these types of verticals to bring the small 
and regional buyers in to create a largecale   national network in every single vertical for not 
like paper call network but just like network of   buyers to cover all of the geographic areas and 
they are basically self-service and um then our   customers can just immediately tap into that and 
there are some other companies in paper call that   do this in home services and some other verticals 
and they basically had a monopoly on the space   um because portion yeah they have like networks of 
small and regional buyers and they take egregious   revshares like 60% 50% they if they can get it 
if they're the only one to doubt it's like yeah   exactly and so like you know I'll just pop to 
it right now on X our average margin presently   is and this is a ballpark this is like 6 to 8% or 
something right like we don't need crazy margin   because we control all of the all the volume right 
like I'm not nearly as concerned about bad traffic   as anyone else because we can see it exactly 
yeah you literally know it's Yeah you see all   the conversion data on it you see the time you see 
everything exactly and you know the vast majority   of the ex participants are um Ringbut customers 
and so we get paid on the telco as well and that's   prepaid basically and so our risk is much lower 
so we don't need to take crazy margins like that   because our core business is software and so we're 
not looking to make our core business this um it's   more of a a way for we can optimize it and do 
the business development for everyone so our   customers can make the most money and it's a it's 
a crazy moat actually for our customers because if   you're not a ring customer you can't sell to it 
just like [ __ ] everybody else i don't care and   it doesn't matter to me that we'll make less money 
that way because I take sides right like that's my   personality my customers are who I serve i mean 
Yeah exactly and you do make you know more not   you know more right like yeah that's interesting 
yeah the the exchange thing is like a ve it's a   very interesting concept they do it in info too a 
lot of the time now that is educationbased but so   you're basically like there's one that's really 
good that's in sales um they have a new one   that's in like female uh sales specific but it's 
basically they like sell to the front so you sell   to the beginner to teach them how to do the zero 
to 10k example and you teach them how to get the   skills and do the thing and then on the back end 
you B2B sell it to you sell the like person with   the skills almost as like recruiting so on the 
back so you get paid two times so your LTV is   like and then generally there's like community 
through it so it's like I teach this person   how to they pay me two grand to learn how to do 
marketing tech or sales they're in my community   i just got paid minus my CPA or whatever and then 
it's a course and then on the back you're selling   them like who needs a marketing tech person 
and then you're selling them for two grand or   five grand or whatever percentage and like you 
just have this like exchange style thing it's   super interesting um yeah I mean depending on how 
hard you want to rip like you said 60% or 2K flat   or whatever it is but well in our case it just it 
just loses money right like the we have a separate   engineering team and a new bisdev team on the 
X side and so the only people making money with   X are customers presently like we our payroll 
on that is millions so um because it's really   complicated technology and we're long-term focused 
like we don't mind making the investment um and so   I think long term it's going to be incredible 
for our customers I just like I just got into   like a public flame war with one uh who doesn't 
like the idea that we're doing this because they   think it'll negatively impact their business and 
I think that that type of mindset is um is really   an impoverished mindset like that's not the way to 
do it the way to do it is to see see someone who's   like "Wow I'm who's built something big and kind 
of crazy right?" And and go like "Okay well how   do I leverage that for my success?" as opposed to 
"Oh my god it it might kill me." And I think it's   hard sometimes for entrepreneurs to move out 
of that paranoia mindset to the like abundance   mindset right yeah 100% and what I have found is 
our largest customers and my my most successful   friends will literally give all their secrets away 
their secrets right because it doesn't matter the   pie is so big that you know people can make a 
ton of money like in paper call you're talking   about I mean we're tracking billions of dollars a 
quarter for Christ sakes and like over a trillion   dollars in commerce happens over the phone every 
year in the United States like how am I going to   stop anyone from making any money like how does 
that even work so um it's really uh an exciting   opportunity i think it's it's super super cool um 
just to see so many people uh be successful i have   a post coming up I'm going to do um like a POV 
one but uh like basically we've helped people make   billions and billions of dollars now and we've 
given away over a billion dollars worth of goat   awards um I see you have your ClickFunnels one 
behind you there which is awesome um I I copied   Russell i'm not going to lie i have all these 
awards in Yeah uh the Miami uh fake penthouse   it's just a I was going to say fake you got to 
make sure everyone knows it's fake yes like the   one I'm in right now is pink by the way this is 
a Zoom back where back background i am not in   the penthouse at the montage in Capalua don't look 
at this but um we we literally covered it in many   versions of of the awards it's such a cool thing 
to see it's a very powerful thing um to see like   the impact it's funny it's like I mean I I love 
those i think they're I think they're super cool   i mean I don't know and how long this one will 
last behind me like we're about to get the third   because each one they're $25 million discs y it's 
like once you get 100 it's like okay and like you   know it was just a fun thing forever because it 
was like oh the million one was on my board you   know my my dream board version which really just 
lives on like a dock or like a Canva image and   then it moved to the 10 and we got that one within 
a year of the other one and then we got that   within a year of the other one and it was like so 
it was just like a cool thing and then would you   say that's hilarious i have the picture of the one 
of you guys bringing onto the jet on my current   one oh wow like because I'm like "Oh yeah no I'm 
for sure moving in the direction of that like at   some point as like a side fun thing." Like I know 
so many people in the space all that it's just I I   love the be I think the beauty of the lead genen 
model is the lean if you do it right obviously   margin different people have different you know 
opinions on that but lean margin the scalability   the no face and like the exit ability like all 
those things in one is like just something you   don't really get in info that you do that you can 
get in e-commerce obviously but like in info it's   not as common um one or two have actually sold 
in info and coaching space like actual info and   coaching of what we're calling it like the guruy 
space um you know Hormosi sold but theirs wasn't   really guruy like it kind of was but it was 
licensing they did a lot of different things   and they did all of the process he has a ton of 
videos about it about how they had to change the   business remove the founder risk like all those 
pieces everything from marketing to product to   whatever in order to do it and like we're in the 
process of that now but at the same time it's like   just business fundamentals we just took a massive 
dive in our break even after doing 30 million in   diving margins because we went from 12 to 30 so 
it's like we have business fundamental things   we need to get to to make sure the profit's there 
like just to sell in general and then founder risk   like we're adding brand faces the product side is 
already out it's all coaches but it's just a lot   of moving parts um with because it's like service 
based but remote it's like remote service based   not just like sell a course not just info money in 
money out and very little fulfillment like so yeah   um there's a lot of layers and the same thing you 
had e-commerce with supplements um so basically   the model we're looking at is info low coaching 
mid to high more coaching like a group style and   then figuring out how to either do partnership or 
self for supplement style for MR so you have like   recurring up here and you have recurring down here 
yeah your back end yeah exactly and just fatten   up the LTV have multiple sources and have like 
consistency and like continuity throughout all   of them and then it is something that could be but 
you know you hear these lead lead genen guys talk   about it and there's you know not to say names but 
you know people who have exited things for 10 and   20 and 50 and whatever that are nice um that are 
nice that are in these lead genen things that I'm   like God and I I joke that that is the biggest 
piece of this puzzle that is like you know it's   kind of like the 8020 it's like get your ads to 
work like everything kind of works which is like   not necessarily true like you need to figure out 
your numbers you need to understand the business   at scale you need to run the people you need to 
operate the thing but like that's the part that   I don't really touch as much like I understand 
what's happening in the ads i understand what's   happening in this but like did I write them did I 
create do the creative did I scale them like no I   didn't like business partner does that part so 
like there's this little like bug in me that's   like I just need to do it myself on something just 
to like feel it just like the a toz portion like   that part of it and it's like yeah it's fun well 
let me I got to go in a minute here i gota go I   got to go feed the Gen Z girls but uh girls well 
look look I I'm from Miami you do whatever you got   to do okay tangent by the way i uh I was handed 
a papaya and told "Have you ever cut one of these   before?" And I said "No." And she grabs her phone 
to go look at a YouTube video and I said "What are   you doing?" I said "Watch this i'm just going to 
grab a knife and we're going to do it." Yeah we're   just going to figure it out real time exact way 
to do it in 30 seconds or less she's like "Well   I don't generally cut fruit." I'm like "Yeah 
I know but I'm old watch this so we're going   to I have a photo i'll maybe I'll I'll tweet it 
it's just like literally me cutting papaya and   putting it into a container the story behind it 
those who know will know the backstory it's just   like you don't even cut your own fruit anymore um 
but what what you talked about there and that's   why that triggered this story is something that 
I have always done and I don't know if a lot of   people do and and that's like at Ringba I don't 
even love my title like I talk to customers all   the time i do customer support i'll I'll do 
anything like it's not you know this is not   my job will get you fired at ring bus straight up 
on the spot and I have done my best I love that   I'm steal oh yeah we don't [ __ ] around that we 
do not [ __ ] around here like you are going to   do whatever is necessary to serve our customers 
and if you will not you are gone like there is   no question about that our mission is to serve 
our customers and that starts with me I go to   all the trade shows I'm at the booth I don't take 
meetings generally So I can just randomly talk to   customers um but my point is is like through my 
entire career I have always spent time doing all   the things so that I understand how they work and 
um you know like at the beginning I did customer   support over live chat like I'll still do it now 
on Christmas I do it so like our team's dude I   have so many we were the first sale like we had 
two people on the team that were taking sales   calls but us three were also on sales calls like 
competing against each other for all the beginning   and like we hired and did those sales things 
this Christmas we I migrated the whole site   from WordPress web flow and built the page and did 
it on Christmas night like solo just sitting here   in the trenches and like everyone's all it was so 
funny but like that had its repercussions uh but   all right man i I really gotta go get some papayas 
and do some things i will post this soon uh when   I get back i appreciate you it was great to meet 
we'll have to hang out cool talk soon bye right
