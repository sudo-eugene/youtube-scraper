What's up, guys? We are back. Familiar studio setup, I assume. And today we've got Josh Troy or do you like Joshua? Josh Troy is better. Josh Troy is better. I don't really care, but double first names. Yeah, I like it. My dad's last name or my dad's first name is Troy. Oh, wow. Yeah, it rings a bell. All right, we've got sales agency sicko. He is somebody that kind of changed my frame on this actually a lot because and we'll get into that into this but I always say most scalable and most systemoriented sales agency guy that I know right so Josh kick it off of who you would say you guys are wires from strangers the badass name too so thank you first of all I think it's hilarious that you say sickos we're just like so obsessed with what we do that it's sick right bunch of sickos just sickos. Um, yeah, you know, uh, our company's Wires from Strangers. Um, a lot of the times we just go by WFS Group. Uh, it's easier to say. And we're we're an outsourced sales agency. So, we just specialize in the education space. We sell info products. Co, you know, coaching businesses are our clients. And uh I think the big thing that we'll probably get into here today and we just spoke about it a second ago. I am one of the only if not the only the only is probably too assumptive but I am one of the only people that that I'm aware of one of the only sales people that doesn't really talk that much about sales. And what I mean by that is I I'm all about sales operations. And I think that's the big thing. You know, a lot of these sales guys, sales agencies, whoever it is, most of the sales content that's out there, it's just like sales training content. You're talking about what's happening on the phone, overcoming objections, whatever it is. And the the big differentiator for us is it's outsourced sales operations, not to be confused with outsource sales. And the point is like it's a full approach to scaling, right? It's the systems, the processes, it's everything that you actually need to scale. And so, you know, I believe that all the money is made in the process, the systems, and the spreadsheets. And so, it's all the I love my spreadsheets. It's my love language. I'm a freak in the sheets. I'm a sicko in the sheets, I'll say now. Um, but yeah, that's that's the big difference. That's all we do. And I think that um I I like to approach things from a very tactical, strategic level. So, we directly met. So, for everyone, so they're clear, we directly met at Onyx event in Was that Dallas, Texas? Yeah, Dallas. Uh, yeah. Yeah. And he's sitting there next to me and he's got his laptop open and I'm just kind of like cruising around the room doing my thing as I do because I can't sit still. And he's over there and he's got like these Slack notification things that are happening. And then he's like clicking on this sheet that auto pulls from here with this like deal ID and it's going into here. And I had no idea what he did. I thought it was like his own info product. And come to find out it's one of many offers. But he has all of these automations and these data specifics and he's got these like breakdown CRM specific teams and all this stuff which is like my love language, right? Like that is what I do. Like when I talk to, you know, Jeremy again, the scene here, we're we're ripping today. It's 10:15 p.m. by the way, and we're going to go for a ripper. Um, but like I understand the structure, the math, the system. So when you say that around sales, the my experience around that was with Cole Gordon, right? Like hearing how he kind of did his piece of it. Like that was my really only piece of that that I learned. And then beyond that, it was like marketing, overall business, that structure. And then when I started talking to you, I was like, "Oh, there are." And like you kind of opened my mind to this of like there are other people out there who think of think in this way but in your world. So I want to like I got n I've got 92 questions. But if I knew that this was possible I have this huge belief around this and I talked about this in one of these videos in here. I talked about it. I was like you shouldn't have a sales team if you like you just shouldn't have a sales team. And my belief is an inhouse sales team. An in-house sales team. I don't think people should have an in-house sales team basically after call it 100 grand a month roughly because I think that headache comes from headcount a lot of the time for a lot of these people most people who are running info coaching are doing cash flow businesses right that is like out of the box majority of people if they want to go in-house they're building this equity value they're doing the thing it's W2 it's like a full suite different story that's what we're doing but back in the day we had a sales team and we were a cash flow business and it was the biggest headache the churn the the the management that everyone has an emotional week and you make no money because it's the only way you make money. The structure, the scaling of it was just it the headcount got bigger there than every other department combined because it's just that's the it's part of the puzzle, right? It's like when your calendar has to get bigger, it has to happen. So, we tried to do 1099 sales management. Mhm. Two or three times. Two and then the third led to having an in-house manager cuz the sales management company was literally like you need someone in house like you we can't do this. But we never had something that was your approach. So explain how you guys do it because if we would have had this, if I knew this was a thing or if someone offered this to me at the time, I would have literally signed it in two seconds and we would I don't even know where we'd be today because now we've changed and it's a whole different model and we're trying to run things for this in-house and we have like W2 sweet things and like this whole structure then I would have and I think most people should. So what is how explain how you guys go about service delivery? I'm doing 150 grand a month. I sell a 7K annual program and I have three or four reps in house and we're like getting by, but I'm like I kind of hate this wholesale team part. Yeah. Well, first of all, if you have three or four closers are only at 150, things are not going well. Real from an average revenue per rep perspective. Um, but listen, I'm very transparent on this. Say it again. So, they're part time. Yeah, they're part time. Okay. Uh, I'm very I'm very transparent on this conversation. Um, that's just the style that's always worked for me. And one of the things I'll say is, you know, I have these conversations all the time. This is what I do. And people, you know, will talk about some of the risks of outsourcing. And I tell them that they are absolutely right. 100% right. I have seen so many bad examples. I'm going to tell you a story actually that I don't talk about often. And I actually didn't I forgot about this until just the other day. I was doing a podcast like this and it reminded me of it. I'll get to there in a second. But essentially what happened uh or essentially my my belief on it is that most outsource sales agencies it is very problematic. It is hard to make work and the reason why it's how they operate. Most sales agencies operate as a third party external siloed team that doesn't have that collaboration and connectivity that you need to truly perform. And that's why there's a lot of horror stories working with these outside teams. Our positioning statement and and the reason I'm I'm leaning in starting with this is because it speaks to how I built this entire company is where your outsourced in-house sales team. That's not a cute line that I say because it sounds good. That speaks to our whole business model. I knew to have the solution that actually made sense and to have a sustainable engagement. I'm not interested in taking somebody from 200 grand to 400 grand and then they have the bright idea to take them in house. I want to stay with them to one million a month, 2 million a month, three million a month. We have clients at all those levels and I can't do that if I don't have, you know, a solution that works long term like that. And so the way that I designed this and I and I literally have had these conversations with soon to be clients and clients and I said I once they understand completely how we do things I say you tell me what would be the difference if you did this in house and they have a really freaking hard time coming up with something that sounds good because the way we build it I'll I'll unpack this for you is there's an M&A term I love explaining this it's called integration now it's exactly how it sounds in merges and acquisitions, one company buys another. You have to integrate the two entities. And one of the number one reasons that M&As fail when they do is because poor integration. It's probably the most important word. Anyone could go buy a company and sign a contract. What happens after the contract is what matters. It's the value creation process. Did you capture and realize the actual investment thesis? And when it doesn't happen, it's because they're not able to uh you know do the integration and capitalize on the thesis, right? And the synergies. And so what happens is they they take they take over something, they start making all these changes and they're just not able to get things to run smoothly as one entity. So there's all these hiccups. I take that same concept and I apply it to every engagement. I want it to feel like one entity. Are we a third-party entity on paper? Yeah, of course we are. But it should never feel that way. And so a couple ways that shows up is first of all, none of our reps cross-ell. One thing that agencies will do is they'll have them sell across multiple offers. I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. We don't crossell. So our reps when we like if we're doing your sales as an example or or any anyone the the the reps that we hire for that account, they only sell on that account. And the communication that we have with the brand and the client and they can be in those Slack channels and they could jump on calls with the team. it feels like their own sales team because they don't sell on anything else. Now, there's actually even more deeper reasons that's important. By the way, we're not going to make this whole podcast about outsource sales, right? But, but a lot of the stuff I'm going to say, even if they want to do it in house, they're going to want to do it this way. And and and we already said at the beginning, like I want this episode to be, in fact, it's my personal mission. I want to make this freaking podcast of yours the most tactical you've done because we're sickos, right? You said it yourself. We're sickos. We're gonna get deep. But listen to this. So the other thing about not cross-selling is I believe a huge a huge mistake that people make wrong with sales teams is they think that all sales reps are created equal. So they hire a rep because they say, "Oh, it's a great salesperson. They have a track record. They sold XYZ." But we treat talent acquisition like customer acquisition. when you build an ICP and ideal can uh client profile we build an ICP ideal candidate profile on on the talent side on the recruiting side and it's just like ideal client profile we have to figure out like well who's compatible with this offer what's the audience what do they look like what demographic sells better what selling style is their experience transferable because not all coaching products are are the same to sell so we look for all those things and when they specialize it could sell a lot better so that's one example the transparency in the data and the dashboards we build. That's a second example. The fact that we build everything and our playbooks and our systems on their tech stack, that's a third example. We don't hold anybody hostage. And so when you go through all of these things, we try to build it in every single way like it is your own team, but you get all the expertise and the proven playbooks and, you know, all of the systems that we bring to the table. And and that right there, I will confidently tell you that is why we have the results that we have and that's why we've been able to create experiences for people that have had nightmare experiences with other agencies. Yeah. And so explain the let's get into the model because I I'm so curious on what your and I don't know how much you want to share not of like your actual structure and how you do it because that's just a talent generation machine. It is a talent experience slash like quality machine like you have. So it's you're in the people business. You can put as many systems on it as you want or run on it as many systems as you want. But like you it's people on the front, it's people in the middle, it's people in the back. It's all people, right? That you are it's all people. In fact, I often say we're a recruiting first business. Yeah, you have to be. We from from day one from day so so my partner and I are he's our chief sales officer. We have uh been in sales for a long time and him way longer. He's been in sales for 30 years. High ticket sales for 30 years. He was an executive uh for Time Shares, you know, in the beginning of his career. The OG high ticket OG dude bribe someone to be there. They want nothing to do with what you're selling. They want their free gift and in 90 minutes you sell them a $30 to $50,000 package and they like you for it. Yeah, that's high ticket, you know. And then, you know, he did speaking and get whatever. The point was we had a warm pool of candidates. Like we we we had a lot of sales reps. We knew a lot of sales reps. But from day one, I said, "I will not start this company without building an absolute like prolific recruiting engine because at one point, no matter how many relationships we have, we will need more. Like we will blow past that." And so from day one, I built a recruiting engine. If we can't recruit or sorry, if we can't attract and retain top talent, we don't have a business model. So, we have to put the rep first and everything. I say no to deals sometimes that I actually know I can make money on, but there won't be enough money for earning potential for the reps and I have to say no because I know it's going to affect my ability to retain the type right talent we want. Do you do you dock like pricing and stuff and talk numbers? We don't have to. We don't have to. You mean like our engagements? Yeah, we can. I I'm I'm transparent about it. Okay. Because I talk about the model because I talk about cost models and structure and whatever like all the time. I'll be like, "Okay, so we're going to this percentage is fulfillment, this percentage is sales, right?" And it breaks down. So like us with W2, right? You take it and you add 20% right off a rip or whatever. You can do your math. It's a little different. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes lower. But like the out of the box closer, if you're just to throw it on paper, 10%. Okay, let's say. I know people who do six, seven, eights. I know people who do 12, 14s, whatever. It's different cash collection. It's different contract value versus there's bonus pools. There's all this [ __ ] right? There's that. There's a setter layon. And then when you get to volume, there's a closer manager, there's a setter manager, and a lot of time there's a sales ops coordinator, right? And then expanded upon. That's my like simple view of it. And that can stack up and internally when you run that can be 15 to 17 points, whatever when you're like humming and can very easily when you stack W2 and some fat and some comp models over top of each other quickly get to 20 22 whatever up upwards of 25 oning accident. There's me my bleeping again. But like that can happen. So your model is we charge 20% of collected revenue. If I was offered this when we were in the position we were in we were doing we were doing a million a month selling info hybrid of coaching like two different offers they could pitch same funnel and we needed it desperately and we ended up getting uh a pod leader was the number one pod leader in a very large info coaching business that does like 12 or 15 or whatever a month right now. It was the largest pod leader to my understanding. Came over, highest month they had done in their pod was like three million. Next thing you know, ramps up. We're doing this whole thing. First time we have like a true internal sales manager that wasn't basically us or doing it. We get up to 3 million. That's the chart on somewhere on there where you see that like uptick that was in that range. So everything was firing. Marketing was firing. Talent acquisition was like boom. Like everything was firing. Selling a high ticket product. Like all of the things made sense to why that rev looked like that but not the profit of that. Okay. Profit was okay but was not [ __ ] good. So if we had that opportunity 20% out of the box, how does your model then work? Like what does a good sales rep make? What does a good manager make? Yeah. How do you acquire consistent amount of insane talent? And like how do you break that out? So I I'll break down a few things when it comes to the economics. So let's start at a very basic level. Now we and I'm very grateful for this. Like we get large relationships. In fact, I just started working with somebody that you introduced me to and uh they were already at a million a month. So, that's not uncommon for us. Big dog. Yeah. It's not uncommon for us. Like we we get large relationships and and and the reason why is because the sophistication of our systems and our approach. Yeah. And that's it's not a sales pitch. Like I show them what I know and they realize, oh wow, there's a lot more to this. And that's how we earn their trust. And so because of our ability to do that consistently, our our average accounts are are already doing um a good amount of revenue. It's usually people that hit a plateau and they're stuck or people that have massive am momentum and they they need a higher level of expertise. They've kind of like outgrown their own skill sets and those are our favorite deals. Like we don't like to just take deals that are on fire. We want ones that have momentum and need firepower. ICP out of a box is so out of the box. For the longest time, I used to say if they're not doing 200,000 a month yet, then then we don't want the engagement. Now, it's not a hard line in the sand. And I won't forget about going back to the economics that you just asked me, but I want to explain that. Well, it's a it's actually a good segue because I want to break down the economics at that level, at that like $200,000 a month level. Yeah. But when someone has 200k a month business, what is their current because this is also something I don't understand about your model necessarily is like pick your math. That's two reps. That's already like they already have something to be doing 200k a month. Exactly. So like Well, that's the key. So let me I'll finish this. We'll go to the economics again. It's not a magic line in the sand. Why do we want $200,000? Now I'm not saying this in an ignorant or insensitive way. I'm saying it from a factual way, in a relative way. When you compare business models across industries, in this industry, comparatively to other industries, $200,000 a month is really easy. I say it comparatively, very easy. Like, there are companies that launch an info product and they're doing 200,000 a month the first month. I I met somebody last night that did 500 grand the first month they launched because the pent-up demand they had. So, it's very easy. So, why does that matter to us? Because my two favorite words in business, I say them all the freaking time. Validation and speed. I have to validate as many variables as I can and then scale those things once they're validated as fast as I can. That's the speed. And so at 200 grand a month, there's a lot of validation that happens. You show me that you have proven lead flow, uh, predictable lead flow, a customer acquisition model that's working. You've, uh, validated product market fit. Now, we could look at comps and things like that, but we see that you have a proven offer that people are responding to. You have the basics of fulfillment figured out because you're already, you know, fulfilling and, you know, I don't want to sell anything I don't believe in, so fulfillment is really important to us. And then, um, and then the economics are working within reason. And so, and like you said, it's usually a couple reps. So, that's why we look for that. Now, there are times where it makes sense at a little bit lower of a level. If it's under 100 grand, they need to get a little further. If they're at a 100 grand, I want to have the conversation because sometimes I could just give them a couple tips, they get to 200, and now we start working with them. Um, but that's the level, right, that that we look for just because we can take a lot of larger deals. So, we don't want to mess with the small ones because again, we have a performance-based model. We eat what we kill. We're confident in what we do. But I can't drag the reps through the mud if they haven't figured out these things that we don't do. I'm not afraid of problems, but they need to be problems that I solve. You know, if I have a call with somebody who's like, I'm at 50 grand a month and I can't figure out lead flow for my life. I'm sorry for that. We don't do lead flow. We're sales, right? So, anyways, that's the point. Now, to get back to the question, so if they're at 200,000 a month, think about the math for a second. You said it yourself, 10% to closers. How much to setters? Just pick a number. Three to five. Three to five. So, call it 15. Now, what do you think a good closer should make? Just a good one. Not an amazing one. Nothing crazy. A good one. Just a good one. 150 200 grand. Okay. That breaks down to 10 to 15 grand a month, right? Yeah. Do you think a manager should make less than them? The same more. This is such a highly This is the [ __ ] people want to hear. By the way, this All right. So, I am of the belief in our organiz like our style, how I want it run is like I don't want to think about it. And the same reason I keep saying it about this like so I guess I would lean in the way of like overpay but I know I would say I've heard market comps and all that kind of stuff lands in a two to 500 like when crushing 500 for a sales manager is extremely high. Yes. But you're making my point easier for me. I am. Let's just say I am. I gave you the math. I know. Yeah. But but here's here's the point. So 200 grand a month. I told you I charge 20%. You pay 10% right out the gate to closers. You're paying 3 to 5% for setters. Usually, everyone I speak to is paying four to 5%. You're at 15. You can't have a good sales manager that's going to make less than 10 grand a month. You said way higher than that. Yeah, way higher than that. Okay. Well, let's just say it's 10 grand a month. What's 10 grand? What percentage of 200 is is 10 grand? What percentage of 200? It's 5% grand. Yeah. 20. I know. I gave you my math off the rip. And then here's the important part manager and then this is the biggest mistake that I see when I go into businesses people think that sales manager means everything sales like so they expect their sales man CRM configuration tech stack reporting data recruiting training call reviews it's like one dude you just named like seven roles in our business and that's what they try to do so you're at 20% % and not even doing the actual job sets that you have to do to properly run a business. So now when you work with us, a lot of those parts can be fractionalized, but you can't hire an eighth of a a trainer. I mean, you could outsource training and stuff, but then again, it just adds to the cost basis anyway. So you get to the same place, right? So this is what we do and we bring all of our, you know, our playbooks in. You you fractionalize our whole structure. We have our whole recruiting department. it until they get to a lot of hundred thousands of dollars a month, we're actually cheaper. Yeah, that's the funny thing. And and most of the time they don't know their sales allocation numbers. So they're like, "Oh, I'm doing it less than that." And I have to so often I have to tell them, Ryan, no, you're not. Yeah. And then I have to break down the math that I just explained because for some reason they didn't do it yet. And then even when you get into pretty significant scale, call it between 500 a million at once you once you start getting over seven figures a month, can you shave a little bit of margin? You can you can save a little bit, but now you're assuming that you are performing at the same if not better than we are cuz percentage margin is one thing, net margins another, or net profit's another. Are you able to do the same things that we do when this is all we do all day every day? Yeah. and the opportunity cost and the and the churn and the headcount growth across that and the emotional weeks and the buckets that are in bad thing and the cultural all of a sudden mismatch and you lose half a team and the like dude I could go all day I should have come on this and been like sell me on why because this doesn't make sense but I instead am just like your hype man right now because it's soing real thought about this so many times I literally I'm telling you I have a dedicated video where I'm like this is like a thing so I could go like 40 directions with this but so the math is the math Yes. Now you fractionalize which portions of this because you have dedicated reps which again obviously I understand and I agree is the most important part because it's the person that's the closest connection. It's the person that's over here but management wise you do have fractionalized. Correct. Yeah. So the way what part of the stack is fractional versus dedicated of like your whole of like you know you have setters you have a sales ops you have closers you have management. Any rep position is dedicated? Setters dedicated closers dedicated. any type of sales rep dedicated. When you get into management, it's fractionalized until a certain point in revenue because if they're doing enough revenue, they have to be dedicated or they have to have two or three based on the level of revenue. So, multiple clients of ours do have dedicated management as well. When they're lower revenue, it's not needed yet because a capac it all comes down to capacity and we run tight capacity models. Now, I'll tell you two things. I from what I've heard and I don't know everybody's business model in the world but of the sales agencies I know of we have the best management to account ratio the amount of low very low interesting very low one to three is usually where we're at and and usually it's two that matters a lot because we run capacity well but it also matters how we're able to do that because we have a very talent leveraged or chart part meaning that I take I look at all the capacity models and I break down every single job set that somebody has because I'm very systemsoriented. We have value engines and we have all of our process documentation and I have time tracking to see how much time they spend on every single task and then I take away and specialize anything that doesn't put them in their most leveraged state that doesn't impact revenue which I could delegate to other teams. So, an example of this is uh our our CRM integration team. We have a full team of sales integrators. They're like sales coordinators that are following playbooks and SOPs on pipeline management and leveling those insights up to the sales manager. The sales manager is managing it with the team, but they don't have to spend the entire week in the trenches doing those things. So, I'm optimizing capacity, staying the most leveraged self to give the most high quality service, which keeps our ratios what they are. Now, this is insane. And and I would actually be fair to other sales agencies and say um that this is probably an outlier and an extreme, but I had somebody from a competitor literally tell me he was applying to me. He was applying for us and he told me himself that he was managing 20 accounts. And I didn't say it, but I thought it. That is what gives sales agencies a bad name. Dude, you can't do that. Yeah, there it's not. Yeah, you're not doing what you need to do if you do that. What do you think a good sales back on? I'm just thinking my mind right now is like economics and math and like models because you're like 20 across these and if they're making this and like in their brain it's probably like they're stacking this or even the person's like, "Oh, they can handle it." And their comp explodes into this. What is a good each one of those layers? Let's go setter. And not to say a setter then closer. I'm not saying it necessarily as hierarchy like that, but like we're just going to say a setter, a closer, a sales ops, which you do a funny integration thing there. You have kind of like a different model I think than that because you kind of go a little wider and do the VA thing I think, right? Versus a dedicated and then a sales manager. Like what are good comps or great comps? What are great compensations? You mean comp plans, not competitors? Comp plans. Comp plans. So OT for these positions. uh five to eight for setters. You have to be above 10 grand for good reps, for good sales reps, for good closers. Really, I believe that top talent opens up at 15K a month. The way that we build our comp plans is that you should be you should be around that range for a pretty good B player. So, that means the A players are going to soar quite a bit past that, right? Um, we we do have reps that make in the threes. It has a three in it, meaning 30s. We have reps that are in that, right? So, above 15 for top talent and closer. Now, some people are like, "Wow, that's crazy." Dude, the market is what it is. And sometimes all the answers on the other side of acceptance. You know how many freaking people I've hired and you know how many talented people we've managed and evaluated? If I could hire the best closers for 10 grand, I would. But that's the market. And what people have to understand in a skill set, you're competing crossindustry. I'm not just competing with this other whatever uh info product. There's SAS jobs out there that are paying $150,000 bases, right? It happens. Now, that's what from SAS is kind of lowering now with where the market's at. Maybe it's not as high as a base, but when you have these things, you have to be a a great and especially in a performance business, you have to have good earning potential there. And then there's other things that you know closers like about the education space. Um sales management 15 to 30. um I in 15 when I say 15 to in this instance I'm talking about ramping meaning like not you're you don't want them to sit there long term but I'm saying like when they start building up you can find really good talent entering in around there um up up to 30 um in in and that position can go higher and it does go higher but here's the thing about sales management which is why comp and OT is very tricky their raise becomes effective as they do it. Dude, it's all it's all capacity. And we have our different KPIs and our different metrics to analyze efficiency, their own activity KPI, so how effective they are with their workload and their team KPIs, the better they are at ramping reps, stabilizing reps, and staying within KPI, the more effortless their job becomes. the more reps they take on, the more earning potential there goes up. So you could have a really good sales manager 30, 40, 50, it can keep adding and that comes with time because they have to build, you know, the team and be leveraged. Um, was there another one that you said? Sales ops. Um, can you be more specific? That's like a category. Yeah. Yeah. So like, so for example, we have like a specific sales ops. I then talked to you. We have a VA that's been with us forever. She was the one who saved me for making it so I had to I could stop resetting passwords at 10 p.m. when I was out because we had six people or whatever and I was still or probably at that point up to 15 and I was still doing all that. And so I got a VA that ended up actually being like five people and I didn't even know but just like sweetheart VA uh from the Philippines. And just recently I was like we've done so many things in the automation front that like the workload kind of like she does all the recurring stuff that's not directly automated or like you know the this and that like which you maybe even could at this point but she is just like so ingrained and where I was like hey you already do all the sales onboarding tech you do all these pieces introed her over to our sales apps coordinator which we have as one specific person who is also sweetheart angel like people person and she now works directly with her for all of like CRM audits and tracker audits and all there. So, it's kind of like a two stack, which right department, but like we have a lead who is that person. We don't have like a couple VAS in the manager. We have like a literal full-on person. Yeah. Which I've also heard is common, right? Like I've heard of other a lot of people like we have we were interviewing for sales managers. We just had a new sales management shift. And uh I mean we have a to be fair, we have a whole operations department. You know, we have a director of sales operations. So, it it goes deep. It just depends what we're looking at. Yeah. Okay. Because I'm like, you know, I hear people who just do it all VAS. I hear people who do it who it's a 50 60k a year. I hear people who have like this Here's how I'll answer this question for you and this is a really good piece of advice here. I think it's like I actually think it's a strategy of mine that I've used for a long time that's very valuable. The way and I I taught myself to do this because it just seemed intuitive. Every business is a little bit different and it's kind of nuance especially like I don't I like to see comps. I like to know other org charts and what's common in the industry as a reference point to get some ideas and to get brainstorming but I don't like to follow status quo because I I most of the time I believe like I can find a more optimal way to do it and that gives us the competitive advantage. Why would I want to copy what everybody else is doing? Now I by definition don't have a competitive advantage. So I've always built org charts and uh positions in a very unique way and what what I do everything is documented again in in in process maps process maps and then I it just like an operating system right I you have process and I've I've gone through so many different programs throughout my career and mentors and people you know different operating systems things like this and you know I have all my process maps I break that down into every individual stage of the process and then I pair that with people and then I try to identify okay now this person's over capacity this is the job set and the skills that they need this is what I this is the position I need and here's what I do regardless of what that person's going to be for you regardless of what the title is I take the job skill sets that the person I need to hire would have and I go find any other position in the marketplace that has those skill sets And that's how I understand the market comp. And so what let me let me make that land a little bit more clear to I want to make sure this point lands. So I hired uh we have a leadflow manager because we have one simple equation. Lead flow time sales performance equals revenue. But Josh, you're sales not marketing. Yeah, we are, but we can't afford to ignore half the equation. And so we have somebody that at all times is looking at lead velocity and call volume to make sure we have the proper inputs to hit our proper outputs and forecasts and they do a lot of stuff. But when I hired that position, I hired for like I think it was like uh life life cycle marketing manager. You see the point? Yeah. And so the point is I found someone exactly what we needed. But dude, if I if I posted with leadflow manager, the quality of candidate would have been way lower. I would have been guessing it would have been this weird hodgepodge. So to to whatever it is, whatever position it is, I just I come to the processes we need them to own. I I figure out the the skill sets that that person needs to have. Use chat GPT to see what other positions already exist that have those skill sets and then look at what the talent pool in the market will tell you they need to be paid. Yeah, I was going to ask you that because you hear so many of these guys that are like, "Oh, I'm a growth operator for info or whatever." And it's like they touch a toz at some point or like, "Oh, I just do sales and then eventually they're in marketing." Or, "Oh, like you know, Jeremy even talks. He's like, "Yeah, we do marketing." And then it's some level it's like we either do it as much as we can in marketing and backend sales systems so they can just be cashiers. But like the whole equation eventually you want to help because it like makes you more money. It makes the the whole account, right, grow. Uh, and it's the thing I just thought of on there was like when you said the two-step equation. Uh, I do you know Josh Snow? Yes. Yeah. So Josh and uh I think and Anthony, they had a lead genen big company and I've heard him give a talk and I might be like this complete paraphrase but they had this big lead genen company and I don't know directly what lead flow they were selling but it was like debt or student loans or credit cards or something, right? And they were like crushing that. They had I heard him talk about this one time. They had a dedicated person that would fly out to like the buyers to the call centers and train them because they had all of his lead flow, but they needed the conversion, the phone portion. So, they was like the exact flip of it, right? It was like dominating marketing flow. Interesting. And they were like, we need to like we want these clients to make more money per call that comes in and in order to do that, then we make more money or then they can grow their call center larger, which means we can send more calls. So they had this like equation where eventually they were like we're going to go outside of our bucket of what our thing is to like continue growth over there. Yeah. And I early on when I heard that and I was like that is interesting. I have a very interesting balance on this equation though. I like where this conversation's headed. I already know that we're going to get into some deep stuff right now because I again I talked about the beginning about sales operations. Um and we're going to give some really powerful sales nuggets on like what's working right now in high ticket sales and different efficiency models and things like that. But the big thing for me is a lot of sales agencies are run by sales guys. I'm an operator, man. There's a difference. Now, sales has always been a skill set of mine. That's why I started this company because I love sales more than anything else. But I am a an actual operator, right? Systems, process, scalable infrastructures. That's what I do. And so when we're talking about this stuff, there's two really important forces that kind of come together and they have to create this balance. The first force is extreme ownership, which is what you're talking about. Meaning, dude, the amount of time we spend on lead flow type activities. I literally have positions for it, and we don't do we work with full-on marketing agencies. Well, why do we do that? Because, like I said, all the answers on the other side of acceptance. I sat there for months and months and months complaining that other people weren't getting it done. But then I calculated how much money it cost me, and I said, "Well, I don't care. for hiring it anyways. But the here's the second force. So that's the first force extreme ownership and just understanding basic opportunity costs in your business and what type of action can can fix that for you. Right? If I have a multiple six figure problem and I can solve that with a couple uh $10,000 hires or whatever it is, I'm going to do that now. And I'll look at the labor efficiency ratios to make sure I have an ROI on the talent that I hire. Now, on the other side though, I'm really big on not going out of our lane. Um, I'm really big on that. So, it's a balance. And here's why. Some of my best employees I've ever had, I've owned businesses for over a decade now. Some of my best employees I've ever had, I've had to had have the most disciplinary conversations with the most frequent. And the reason why it's always one topic, they're such a high output individual that they start to do everybody else's job. And now they take away from what I need them focused on that ruins their efficiency and they make everybody else weaker and lazier because other people are like, "Oh, we could lean on this person, send it to that person, ask this person, do less." And they actually hurt efficiency in other areas. It's happened so many. I've had to had I'll be like, "Listen, you're one of my best employees and I'm going to have to fire you." I've had these talks, dude, because they don't understand. They're disrupting the business and they they mean good. They mean well. They have good intentions, but it's actually damaging the business- because of that, right? So, those two sets of logic is why I'm so careful on that balance because anytime we start going out of our lane, you know what happens? It's a lose-lose situation. Here's why. If we start doing something that isn't actually what we're paid to do, one of two things happens. There's only two scenarios. We do a good job or we do a bad job. If we do a bad job, now we have consequences for something we don't even get paid for if we do a good job. Now, they want us to keep doing it and we don't get paid for it. So, there's no point. So you have to identify is this leveraged enough where it makes a big enough difference where we're going to allocate resources or do we draw draw our foot you know a line in the sand and make sure that ex we communicate properly to external partners. Yeah. And like the person that you're talking about earlier that I made the referral over like that's a perfect case point because in my head I'm like okay cool if you have the right you already have the right ICP but like you know if they fit in that box well enough it is a like 1 plus one equals 55 scenario like those guys are marketers. Yeah, those guys are market both the two different people I'm thinking of are very aggressive marketers and if they can just focus on that entire like you'd get in their way if you were over in their lead flow like of course some like hey can you guys this or feedback from sales is one thing feedback from sales is one thing and is a lot different than needing direct help in marketing like these it goes back to the initial word you have to have the integration don't get in each other's way exactly like a big pet peeve of mine and dude this has nothing to do with ego it has nothing to do with control. But do not tell me what to do on a sales call as a marketing team, leader, anything. Don't [ __ ] tell me, dude. I don't want to hear it. Why? Because we have done so many thousands of calls and we have such a big track record showing that we know what we're doing that like, I don't care about your opinion on what you feel should happen if you don't have that track record. But guess what? Same thing. I will check my team so hard if they try to correct somebody on marketing because I I believe in that level of respect and trust. Yeah. If we're going to ask that trust, I will not tolerate one of our sales managers or team members trying to tell marketing what to do. Yeah. The feedback loop in collaboration, however, is critical. Yeah. Every week, you should be connecting with marketing and sales. Take out the blame game. Something that people love when I say I create a culture around you're not you're not allowed to use the word lead quality for my sales managers. You're not allowed to use it. You know why? It is so freaking subjective. It drives everybody crazy. It produces no clear actions. Oh, the lead quality is low. How how much low? How high was it? What changed to make the quality lower? How was it impacting? I don't like it. So, we have to have very specific data points on how we communicate that. But the reason the feedback loop is important is because everything you ever want to ever need to know is on the call and they're not on the calls, we're on the calls and they trust us to listen to it. So, we have to pass that down to adjust front-end messaging and positioning to improve lead quality. And you know, again, we don't say it like that, but you understand the importance of the relation. Absolutely. Yeah. Like we just had a call this week. We have new sales management in place and we have CMO that's newish but like you know months in and but it was kind of like still the initial melding of minds because a new there's a new player right in there and it was like understanding on what the current setup is and we were trying to solve for show rates which is the fun which is the classic like right there get them in the same room and in all fairness everyone's trying to learn everyone's but I was trying to like navigate the conversation that like it started to lean in this direction it was like oh well we can do this with the application or this with this And it was like whoa stop like don't like pull back. Like marketing's got this. Marketing's got this part. Like yes, there's a lot that marketing can handle. If people are booking and then instantly cancelling like there is a frame thing that does not even make its way to sales that you guys need to worry about like you know like we'll we're going to handle it over here. Like there needs to be trust over there to handle it. Then on this portion like what is the communication like the pass off and the automation? What can we do for you there? It was like a sales or it was sales marketing like a tech. We're all sitting in there and it's I always say the the the bridge from marketing to sales is Zapier. Yeah, exactly. Like that's the position you need to connect the two. I have a senior tech lead that is like a rock star and he had a it's he was like in our exact business model like niche prior had his own business stand up and like he just really liked that part of it and when he ended up shutting his kind of down he came over with like perfect fit and now there's two of them in there and then one came like perfect fit and we I call them the boys now because we have two it's just two guys and we're just like the boys. um they are building all things sales tech and in that world and all the tracking around it and it's eyes are opening as to what is lead quality when two people are in the same round robin and one has a 42% close rate and one has a 12% close rate it's like there's your lead quality and I'm like what do you mean like it's literally the same bucket like it's not like it's not a teamwide so okay I do want to zoom back though because if we're getting tactical we're getting tactical comp plans for closers yep okay there's 52 different versions of it I can tell you ours, you can tell me your like what do you think right now? What's working now? What is like industry standard? We know the rough averages. They need to make around 15. They can get upwards of 30. Yes. But like on cash collected versus contract value versus 30-day versus and I'm I'm going to try to condense I'm going to try to condense my answers in in in the amount of words I use to get more coverage in in topics. So here's the answer. I'll start with first principles. Everything starts with OT. When you build a comp plan, you have to understand the on-track earnings that you're trying to get into. What how much money should they make if they're hitting KPI? Well, you have to start with the KPIs then. And you can only plug KPIs and target metrics into a funnel. So, anytime somebody asks me like, well, what should I pay the sales sales reps? The first thing I say is like, what is your customer acquisition model? Cuz you have to plug it into there. And then you have to see what's realistic in terms of metrics to hit. What I said, real. Like, that's the thing. That's where it starts. Like I I've created a video on this somewhere on my Instagram. It was like 7 minutes long. It was this random rant I did on a Saturday cuz everybody asked me about comp plans. Like guys, where do they need to be? Map out your funnel. And then you have to see what's realistic for those metrics. Get some baseline and benchmarks. I know them because I see so many different brands. And then and then or just get a baseline of whatever information you have at that time. And what pay range does that put them in? Play with the percentages until it puts them in a range that you need to attract and retain top talent. That's the simple part. Now, let's go step two, right? That's just like how you get a basic model. Now, the deeper part about this is comp plans. The the the basics, the most fundamental building block of a good comp plan is that it incentivizes behavior. It influences what you need them to do. This is why there's actually a lot of uh really large enterprise people out there that say that like comp plans are ever evolving. I subscribe to that methodology, but it's a little bit different in a model that's so repeatable like us and it's going across a lot of different things because there's a lot of uh consistency in these models. But in other plans like SAS where they have like growth uh phases and then they have, you know, harvest phase, they have all these different business phases. they have to constantly shift it based on these moving targets and financial goals, right? So the point is you need to have things that incentivize the behavior. So what in what in what are we trying to incentivize? Well, there's only a couple things you want. Efficiency, total revenue, and collections. Like those are the main things that you're looking for. So a couple different things that are super common is like pay a couple hundred bucks extra for a PIFF, right? to focus on that. But dude, here's the thing that's interesting. Some people, they start incentivizing things that lower stuff. Why? Because now they're pushing for the revenue too freaking hard. So like if you give them a huge piff, that's going that's overcorrecting. And then the other thing I find and like this is why dude I could I could literally if you want to go till it's fre what is it Friday night? If you want to not stop and go till Sunday night, I won't run out of words because there's so much to say on these topics, right? But back to the point. So when you have a comp plan, one thing people don't actually realize is you need to give them highly specific training that relates to it. So if you're going to bonus on PIFFs and collections, you have to have really detailed training, standardized training on how you optimize for collection rate. What is your funding waterfall? Interesting, right? Yeah. People don't realize that training actually goes into the comp plan because you start incentivizing them. So they start hyperfixating on that. But if they don't have the skill sets now, they're losing deals because they're trying to slam dunk deals when maybe they could have got a payment plan or whatever it is. So you have to go uh you know there's things like this. So that's like paid in full collections route. You could you know it's usually a couple hundred bucks really low. Then you have accelerators that I've always liked. Accelerator, sliding scale, layer cake. There's different names for it on different tiers of um of of revenue and and it's all again it's all based on averages. So if if my if my baseline and pretty good is here, then they'll get an additional accelerator here, right? Uh they might even have a lower accelerator if they're below the average KPIs. So they just get a small percentage additional at these different tiers. Biggest tip I can give you right now on comp plan. The biggest thing I see even when there's a right comp plan in place is they don't have qualifiers like pairing metrics. No qualifiers meaning I'm going to explain it. If so I I actually had a real engagement I took on and I inherit some wonky comp plans like some weird I'm like how did you even think that would work? kind of want to give you ours so you can like Well, hold on. We'll do that in a second. We'll break it down and it will be fun cuz it might it might fall into the wonky category. It could. It's I my mind it's simple and like I get the math and like I probably actually would change it to make it simpler and so the math works better. But well, don't let me lose you here. This is such an important part. I'm in. All right, we're He just turned his chair. He's now he's I need more nicotine by the way. But uh All right, so check this out, dude. Qualifiers. So, I had a client that before they came over to us because I have to bring in the comp plans and fix a bunch of stuff, right? They had this massive accelerator. First of all, it's too big of a jump because they didn't build in a spreadsheet. So, they weren't even looking at the math, right? But they had this math. It's not the worst. It's the worst, dude. And they don't even know it a lot of the time. But they they had this massive accelerator for a certain level of revenue. Well, dude, so they had reps that they allowed to just take as many calls as they want, and they were taking like crazy amounts of calls a day, super long hours, working on weekends. They'd hit these accelerators. They're getting massive commissions as a percentage. And their close rate and efficiency was horrible. Yeah. Return on revenue. And so I'm like, what are you actually trying to incentivize? Just people to be sloppy as hell and work all day long cuz that's what your comp plan says. Like what if your comp plan can speak? Is it saying what you think it is to your team? Because this comp plan was telling the team, you can be as lazy and sloppy as inefficient as you want as long as you take a shitload of calls to hit that top revenue number and then their rorowaz would turn to [ __ ] So as that example, if you're going to have these accelerators at different tiers, have an efficiency qualifier. So I'll give you a basic example. Let's say it's 10% up to 120 grand in revenue per rep. And then if they hit 150 grand, it goes to 12%. With a qualifier of X collected dollar per booked call. Ah, gotcha. Right. Parametric. Yeah, that's what I was saying, too. So, well, and I didn't say you were wrong. I just I didn't know if you were saying the same. I like qualifier. That's a better one. It's a qualifier. It's like you're not qualified to accept that bonus without these other things. I like that. So to recap all account planes, you start with OTE, you build it in whatever customer acquisition model that exists. Um, you know, you have your basic metrics that are going to get get you there. Come up with accelerators to incentivize top performers. Have qualifiers so you don't mess up and pair training with whatever you're actually expecting them to do. Interesting. Yeah, we do that actually for some of the seuite things that are like uh let's use an example, but like a CPA paired with a volume metric, right? Like it has to be like anybody can hit a $50 CPA, let's say if you only sell two units a month, but like you need to sell like x amount of hundreds plus this and that like you know they come together and then they build this beautiful thing and it's very simple math once all you know these three are hit. It's like here's your simple chart at this number it's this at this number it's this or percentage or whatever. That's a great comp plan. And dude, the last note I'll say on that, nobody likes making mistakes in the moment, but I'm so grateful for the mistakes that I've made, dude, because I get such there's so many times I make a mistake and I'm like stoked. I'm like, that's awesome that I just learned that. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made with comp plans is I had an an operational role, a director level operational role, and I it was a labor efficiency ratio that it was intended to be improved. So, how efficient their time was would get me a better ROI. And basically, I had the concept of I want them to buy their bonus. If they increase efficiency, I can pay them more and it doesn't cost me anything because their output's higher and we get more done. That's the concept. It's a great concept. I I still do that concept. Comp plan was wrong, though, because I incentivize this person based on project completion. Guess what this person didn't do? all the other [ __ ] things they're supposed to do cuz they they're like, "Yeah, I'll just hit everything. I'm just going to do only that because as soon as I finish, I get bonus." Yeah. And I was like, "Wow, that is a real life example of the power of a wrong comp plan." Yeah. 100%. All right. Tell me if we're wonky. So, this has evolved 42 times, right? And again, we do this in-house. So, we have learned this on our own. We've had different influences. We've had different things we consume. We've had different managers. Mhm. So in current state or W2, okay, they will sit that we use a metric called sales per booking. Sales per booking for us is all bookings that come to the person. Everything that comes from a calendarly that gets booked with them and every sale they have. Very simple. It was always the easiest number for us to track like from the OG days like literally have a calendarly logger basically of like sales rep name, date of call, boom, boom, boom, and then book and then uh closes right new units. That count is we call a sales per booking percentage. Okay? So we know what's good for us. So let's say let's use example numbers here, but let's say an 8%, a 10%, and a 12%. Let's say those sales per booking percentages, which really is a function of live call close rate and show rate, right? I want you to explain this one more time because it seems like it's going to be important to say if your structure is wonky or not, and I didn't understand it perfectly. So say it one more time. All bookings to all sales that they get. So a sales rep, you're just talking about booked call close rate instead of live call close rate. Okay. Yes. We just call it sales per booking just because that was what we called the things on the sheet way back in the day. So it's SPB. So we have that and we'll use 8 10 and 12% and again it's a function of live call close and show rate right at those different tanches they'll make 8 n 10 points. Okay. In addition to this so that's like the core mean potatoes. We are W2 so you have a draw base. So it's, you know, federal minimums or whatever. It's XYZ. You'll have people who just hit that one when bad weeks or whatever and they still get paid that over X amount of time. If they have that over X amount of weeks, it's not good. Pipped, done. Right. They stay at the space. We also track RO, return on rep, which is what you're saying, which is how much dollar does it cost? If it's $100 for bookings and they get a 100 bookings, then how much did they cash collect? How much did they cost in commissions? And then like that math equation, what's the return on the rep? We don't actually use that for anything. It's just a metric that's tracked. And then the only other one that is tied to compensation directly they get draw they get clawbacks right on it on everything. Um and then there's a bonus framework that exists that they get $1 per point of cash collected. Okay. So it's just points that are basically just cash collected dollars or points but on times that we want more availability that doesn't exist. What does that actually mean? $1 on points. So if they're 80% collected they only get 80 bucks. Yes. On every seller total. It's straight up cash collected. First 30-day cash collected is points. But like this might be the first wonky part if I'm understanding it right because the most that they could make is 100 bucks in. No. So cash collected is points. So if someone collects 100k throughout the week, they get 100,000 points, which is how many dollars? Which then there's this bonus pool that exists. But then where I'm going with this is there is weekends they get 1.5x points on cash collected and on holidays and stuff. So it was always to incentivize. Were you a [ __ ] credit card company, bro? You have a whole rewards program that brings Yeah. And it makes it so it incentivizes and if you close this many sales, you're going on a trip to Hawaii, dude. And on Saturdays, if you slang 10 G's, you get 15,000 points instead of 10,000 points. Yeah. Okay. And then our pay periods are Sunday to following Saturday. So two weeks because we do bi-weekly payroll W2. Okay. In that in that range, they're closing all their deals. They're getting all their 8 n 10 commissions. They're doing that, right? That all exists. Then they're pushing they incentivize to the it's really just volume of cash collected, right? But you get these bonuses if you decide to work on weekends and like try and push for that if you optimize around weekends or holidays or any that stuff. We started this when it was $1099 because you couldn't tell people directly when to work. Now we're W2 so like we could just have shifts and like specifics around there and not have to incentivize and pay more out of pocket to work a weekend or holiday or whatever depending, right? You can have shifts and all that kind of stuff. But we still have this in place. These then will kick in. And I'm blanking on the numbers, which is probably the whole [ __ ] point of this, but like it's like let's say 60,000 cash collected is like a 3k bonus, a 6K, 9K, 12K bonus that are from these bonus pools. And we've had sales reps that have hammered it and done hundreds of thousands of cash collected and hundreds of thousands of points that then hit these big ones. And like the thing that changes though is the percentage climbs relatively aggressively when they start to get in these bonus pools to where instead of making 8 n 10 like it can be 13 14 like 15 some range but again it's only on like the top performer and only on that week that they're crazy top performing. The median average does roll down to like whatever range. We can talk about that more but like it's healthy. Like if you're if you're a killer rep like you're cracking cash. Yeah. So as a company and then how make it wonky and whatever and like the big question they always have is the sales for booking. They're like why I can't control shows and it's like okay well some reps will have a 60% show and some will have a 40. It's like why right like you at some level can control your shows not well and they also can control rescheduling working pipeline. Yeah. And we have everything set to like auto rebook with them. They have their own dedicated links that don't count towards that sales per booking number if they like rebook them themselves. Like we have like all that stuff as optimized as we can. But all to say, top reps crush and the average lands back in whatever bucket. So it's like, is that too variant? Is it something simpler like 8 10 12 that exists? So I'm going to break down a few things. Um, let me just first say, let's pretend the numbers are great. Y, let's say the numbers themselves actually work. The one thing that's wrong with it is it's it's way too complicated for my liking. I I will bet you that most people that just watched this don't know what you explain. I think I probably didn't explain it that well either. Well, it's just complic it's complic like I want to explain a comp plan in like a paragraph and everybody understands it. That's just always what I liked because it also sets clarity and like I've I've actually dude we have we have so many reps I've seen that like reps get really frustrated when they constantly have to like use a spreadsheet to figure out what they're going to make. They want really quick math. So, but but again that's just kind of a side note of like it's complicated. Does it functionally serve a purpose? Um, here's the thing. You're focused on incentivizing the right behaviors. So, I think you have the right considerations in place. I liked book call. Uh, I liked book call close rate that whatever that metric you call it. Sales per booking. Yes. PB. Now, now here's the thing. Do you have only one price point? No. Well, we have internal pay plans. We have But offer price. Yes. What's your price point? Sevenish. Okay. Nothing else. One offer price point. Okay. So, it doesn't matter as much. That's why I asked it. But booking to close rate, the booking close rate that we're talking about that you don't have a collections meter in there. Now, you have Yes. No. And I have it, but no, it's not anywhere in the it's not directly tied to the comp plan. It's not directly tied to anyone. And but that's one of the issues. Now, obviously, I like to assume that most people have integrity and are trying to actually do a good job, just not cheat a system, but that system can be cheated if they want. If I have a bonus coming and all I have to do is increase my close rate, I'm just slamming the easiest path of least resistance deals. I'm going for the lowest payment plans and lowest price points and I could manipulate it. Again, I like to assume that most people aren't doing that cuz they, you know, whatever. But I I don't I can assume that. I'm not going to have a gap in the comp plan that allows it though when it happens. So that's I'm just saying points. That's one point. That's one point, right? Um the second point is um there's a lot of context that is required here. So, one thing that's really important with accelerators and bonus plans, it's another really good tip for anybody building comp plans is you should really only have your top the percentage changes based on how many reps you have, but only your top 10 to 20% if you have a really small team, 30% should hit that because what and I think people don't one one other issue with comp plans, they don't adjust the bar frequently enough. So, let's say that the you're an accelerator is at 150. Like I was saying, you you pay more when they hit 150 grand in revenue and you've done it so long that like most your team hits it now. Dude, you got to move the bar back. You got to adjust it because now you're overpaying and that's great. Everyone's improving, but they're going to settle there because you were initially incentivizing them to push harder. They don't have to anymore because they're better. Everyone's winning. Yeah. Lead flow gets better. Pricing So many now. Now, there's a place where there's a give and pull. I'm not trying to like pull the rug under reps. I want them to do well. I want them to stay with us for as long as possible. So, you might get to a point where you're like, you know what, if I don't care, I'm paying everyone this. If they all hit it, I'm now happy and content with the numbers. So, that's another side of it. But, like, you have to constantly re-evaluate where that bar is. Um, and that's what I was going to say is like when you have those accelerators like you have to you have to look at that like am are are too many people hitting it? Is it too easy to hit? And that goes back to the model in the first place. I like to model things out for a B player so all the A players are going to exceed it. Yeah, that's that's the way I look at it. Um, other than that, you know, I think you have good considerations. Um, I I think there's a more simplistic way to do it. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, because well I mean what we were trying to achieve and then it was like adding things together but sales per booking is based on the count right so the the unit count so it's not just incentivizing just like only piffs and only this well that's why like my favorite metric is collected dollar per booked call because it's guess what it's not collected dollar per live call I'm still going off booked call which is what you want but I'm going a layer deeper because collected dollar per booked call is accounting for collection rate and the average sales price, which matters if you have more than one offer level. Yeah. We call like new rorowaz versus 30-day cash versus right. Roughly. And like so I was talking I was talking to marketing the day and I was like listen like example numbers here. $100 per booking for per generated booking. If we get 400 over here you guys have 4x on the front. Like very simply put like that's the math. And they were like oh like because all these numbers all tie together in some way. It's like you can just zoom out. It's like or is it cost per sale? You're just going one layer or one layer showed you know live calls. The next layer is booked calls. the next layer is at like we can look at this in a million ways. But yeah, that was our goal of that and I'm sure it'll change. We just got a really good sales manager. Um it's not public I don't think yet but uh we just got a really good one that is I'm very excited for because I think it's finally like the they can run it like like I think we sometimes over micromanager is probably the wrong word but like kind of just like exist in a lot of the departments probably too much like we'll just kind of like plug in or like oh this or that and do what you said where it's like we almost like take away from them from being able to like fully express or lead and sometimes that's necessary right if there's like things going wrong or if like you need to kind of steer the ship. Yes. But like I'm excited about this person because I think that they're going to we're trying to build like the seauite reports to the seauite kind of vibe not like you know what I mean like as the collective there's four cores and it's like if we all meet together I facilitate that style like in there and then they all can collaborate and do their thing and then I'm adding this project manager person I was talking about that then can like help facilitate their project flow but we can make decisions together and like report together. I'm like if we can harmonize around that like that's my dream world. But where do you want to take this? I can go into seven models. I can go into I want to take me into some tactical [ __ ] that people want to know about sales models in a second here. Um I was going to say one comment before we left that which was uh what was it? Oh, it was just a quick comment that came to mind. Here's one thing that we do really well and I think it's something that a lot of companies don't have which is um there's there's two things that come to mind. Most sales managers in an organization I in this industry in this industry are the highest ranking salesperson in the org chart in this industry like dude most of these info products don't have sales managers sales directors VP of sales chief sales officer they don't have that so my point is this most companies hire a sales manager because they themselves aren't great at managing sales sales and then the sales managers, the highest rankings and most qualified salesperson in the organization. Where I'm getting with this is they don't have development themselves. Yeah. Real. And so you have So this is the big thing, dude, is like think about sales reps. We train every single day and on top of all of that training, then we have individual brand trainings throughout the week. So there's a lot of training. Well, what about the management training? So something that's really powerful of ours because we have a whole training center for our sales reps. It's called the 10 steps to wires from strangers. It's our way that we run sales calls. It's our whole proprietary selling framework. And then we have a whole sales training center for management and we do management development. Every single week we're training on different concepts and frameworks and methodologies and skill sets. And you just you made me bring it up because it's like there's so many of these questions that people don't know where to find it and it's like well there is no development for that stuff and and you know there's a there's an old saying business saying that says everybody rises to their own level of incompetency. Have you heard that? Yeah. Because it's like if you're really included everybody dude included it. Well well but here I think here here's the difference though and I guess anyone could do this but they usually don't. at the very top CEOs, business owners, we go invest, like I don't know about you, I go invest in things when I hit my peak. Yeah. If I don't have the expertise, I find someone who has it. I pay them to teach me what they know. Yeah. Now, most most of the time, not everybody, but most of the time, lower levels in the organization, they're not investing outside of the company. They're looking for their company to get it or they're they're looking to get it from the company. And if you don't have a way to to develop and continue to train management, there's nowhere to get that information. And so that's a really important piece that we have and we do that I think is what makes us just really good and consistent across the board from a from our sales management motion. Second thing, and I didn't actually think about this for a long time. Um, actually a a client voiced it to me and I was like, "Wow, I should say that more often cuz that's a huge value ad out of ours that I actually didn't realize until probably 6 months ago, which is this. You just did another podcast before this and um and uh you guys were talking about culture, right? Culture is really important especially in sales. You need high sales energy, you know, high perform performance culture." Well, one thing that we have is a is a triple figure headcount in our sales force. Well, even though all of our reps are dedicated on the brands that they work with, if I take on a couple hundred,000 account, they have two reps, $500,000 account, they have four or five reps, whatever it is, they are instantly in an ecosystem with that many freaking people, dude. Right? Triple headcount. I mean, they're on calls with a hundred other people at a time and training with reps. So, there's this like roaring sales energy that these other companies, they cannot duplicate it if they wanted to. And it's really interesting because in sales, there's two main motivators for sales reps. Money and acknowledgement because we're competitive individuals. Well, dude, do you want to be at the top of a leaderboard for a twoman team or in our organization when you're compared to that? So, like that's a big driving factor that like we just have and you get to benefit from all that energy even when you only actually have a couple reps on the account. So, I just wanted to say that because I think there are two really critical things that are interesting that other companies don't usually have. But, take me deep into like a series of rapid fire questions. A series of rapid fire. Yeah. Well, I mean, or slow fire. I don't know. Just slow fire. I feel like all I feel like every like I I go down this rabbit hole. So, like my next one is like, okay, cool. You have a setter, right? I just I'm going so tactical, but like you have a setter. So our example, I'm selfishly using this. We have setters that sit in three buckets. Okay. Okay. So our three buckets are auto set, which is going to be someone that comes from a low ticket for an ascension call. So like an onboarding, whatever, right? We call them auto because we auto book in them for 15 minutes zooms. They do the ascension call, which is getting them on with a closer. To be clear, the ascension's from the low ticket though in this case. Correct. So it's specifically that. So we don't autobook them with anything else. So, we've talked about doing it, but we haven't. Okay. We then have selfset, which is your classic like dial the CRM. This is a mixed bag of uh app no books, no show cancel, um just dialing the CRM, uh whatever lists of people just out of the CRM. That's self-s bucket. And then we have uh ad confirmations and that is literally a marketing booking comes in, speed, they claim it, there's no round robin. It's like whoever on it, call it, boom, boom, boom. Okay, those are But on that third bucket, did they book an inbound call or it was just an offer? Booked inbound. Everything's inbound. Complete booking. So they complete booking. Let's just recap tomorrow. First booking is Ascension upselles from low ticket. Um ascension set call with the closer. What then? What are set call the closer? Yeah, they're set. All Yeah. All they're doing is setting the call with the closer. Yes. For the ascension. No, but you said self book. So did they book the call with the setter from that funnel or with the closer? With the setter. Okay. That's what I mean. So sorry for all right. So low ticket ascension with the setter. Inbound booking. The second one is optin speed to lead. Uh technically we don't have it on optins. So it's application no books. It's no show cancels. It's like we have to Okay. No bookings though. Dialing prioritize speed to lead. Third bucket is inbound bookings speed to lead. Correct. Really smart and and and the the only person that I've talked to recently that does that outside of us. I I don't actually know anybody else. Um, and I want to get into that in a second. But you explain the buckets. What's the question? So, the the two that are uh easiest, simplest, I don't want to interchange those words, but I'm going to here. Uh, are auto ones that come in that are 15 minutes that are like just your calendar is just 15-minute bookings back to back to back. Those and the ad confirmation ones that uh you're basically just speedily dialing. All you're doing is having not again, not all you're doing. I understand it's like a very val crazy valuable um uh nicotine. Um but those ones are 5 to 12 minutes whatever it's preframe it's yeah you know it's a zoom call hey like you know basically qualifier check and then if they don't they'll unconfirm them. Those buckets are one compensation one percentage and then the selfset are more difficult. They take more time. It's you dial 100 you get your five answer. You know you do that right which our actual connection rate is crazy high because they're only hitting the newest leads. So, we haven't optimized the dialer system or any of that stuff to like really manage and hit the 350,000 phone numbers we have that are not purchas. So, those are different comp buckets all with the base that pours across them and they like now are like, "Oh, I'd only rather be on this one because I can make more comp over here or this." And like the one that makes a majority of the comp is the ad confirmation because they just get that one right now. the math on this and what we're trying to solve for on show rates and whatever. They'll claim right now, call it 60%, 55% to 60%. They will confirm. The other ones aren't even answering them. So, there's like a marketing issue, right? It's like they can't they like they instantly will dial them. They won't even answer them. They won't text back. They won't anything. So, it's like no, of those buckets, we'll get like a 84% show rate. We'll get like an 80 or a 68 to 72% show rate, and then we'll get like an 84% show rate. the economics on the ascension one insanity but we just can't like that's marketing thing again keep cost per book or uh net CPA at whatever rate so that the throughput makes sense on the math but like the economics and the percents amazing ad confirmation that they confirm amazing self-set lowest one of shows so we're like dancing this line on like okay cool we can just basically bump the floor of kind of these which we're which we actually just did so we bump the floor on on comms as a percentage for some of these buckets but it's like keeping them dedicated I could go down a million roads of this, but it's like we need dialer systems that are in place. We still don't have one of those. We're like shopping different softwares. We just got new recommendation trying to like optimize it so that their efficiency is there so they can make the comp that they like, you know, get in that 5'8 range and we have ones that hit that like we have the sickos who hit that and then we do the kind of player coach thing at some level over those pods. But we're just navigating that and we have a really good uh outbound director, setter manager person that came from your world and you'd know the name, right? But like, yeah. So, I'm just trying to understand like bucket-wise, does that make sense? Should they be dedicated because sometimes they can't because there's not enough necessarily flow or they just have overall capacity to do multiple of them. Let's break down a few things because there's so much that you could go into. Um, I believe for the most part there's it depends for everything, right? It's like the attorney answer, which I hate, but it depends for a lot of things. There's a lot of factors. But when you have enough volume where you can have all those positions specialize and still be enough opportunity, I like to do that because it's less complexity. Like at scale, you should specialize as much as you can. For example, if you have an upsell funnel, not like an a low ticket to high ticket, like a high ticket to higher ticket, like a back-end acceleration ascension upsell funnel. Well, if you only have a handful of opportunities, you have the same closers do it. But if it builds into a beast of an engine itself, it's a separate team. Yeah, we have a separate team. There you go. So, same logic there. Um, now where but here's the considerations that we look at and you kind of even you hinted at it. If there's very low earning potential in one bucket and it's like very imbalanced and you determine that it's not enough. So, it goes back to financial modeling, dude. Everything is done in spreadsheets, dude. Everything. Because here's what I look at. I've done this math so many times, by the way, on actually the same thing you're talking about. And then in other closer examples where if this if the earning potential in bucket one, and for the listeners, by the way, don't even worry about anything you said if you got lost on all the buckets because it's confusing. Just listen to this analogy. There's three buckets. Doesn't matter what they are. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing this on like hard mode and there's just like a much easier way to do it. And I also think that my uh articulation around some of these maybe isn't the best it could be. So, apologies to every No, it's not it's not even that. You're actually articulating it very well. It's just there's so much to it that if you already understand it or Yeah. Well, and and and you could just get lo like, dude, I don't know. I don't know if it's just me or what, but like because of the time, I'm tired. I'm just like, wait, what did he already say? But you're saying it well. It's 11:30 p.m. by the way, guys. 11:30. Yeah. Um, but here's the point. If bucket A is performs way less in terms of earning potential and bucket C is way freaking higher disproportionately. Well, here's what will happen. You'll actually as a company have to allocate more commissions as a percentage because if you want to specialize, the only way to get the earning potential here is to pay way more in a rate. But as a blended rate, yeah, it's okay because they're all sitting right here. And so you just make it a part of the job set. And and and dude, I refuse to have the ta the tail wag the dog. Meaning I will not have like an attitude from a rep dictate how we run a business. Yeah. There is a tradeoff in employer, employee, relationship, rep to management, whatever you want to call it. I'm going to do my best to put you in the best financial situation. I expect you to do the same for us. That's how it works. And there are some things it's it's a culture. It's an expectation. It's a level of professionalism where hey, we need you to do these things. We understand that they're not the best money maker for you, but we need those as a company to be able to pay you everything else we pay you and provide the opportunity we pay you over here. So sometimes it's just a culture expectation thing if people complain about it. But it is harder to specialize in those things, right? Yeah. The second thing that I look at is does it disrupt the workflow? And this actually matters because if you have a speed tole bucket where they're just buried in all day long here, here's a good here's a good bucket as an example. Midt buyers where you're not trying to upsell right away and you're trying to upsell later. So let's say they bought a one or $2,000 course. They already went through a sales process. They bought a downell. That's a bucket that we want to revisit in 3 4 weeks call it. But speed to lead is not important. They already spent a couple thousand dollars. They're a customer. We're gonna get a hold of them, right? So, we don't need speed to lead. Well, speed to lead is where we have to prioritize our time. So, if we're dialing that list, you're breaking the workflow cuz it's two different job sets. So, in those instances, you could do one of two things. We could specialize or you just break up the day. And so, we'll have like speed to lead all day long this period of time, you know? you do this and we offset it with the setters which you said you don't like making things complicated that does make it complicated sometimes you have to at scale but does that make sense what I'm saying if it breaks the workflow then we get into those types of conversations but now I'm going to answer this in the simplest way possible because those things make sense right these are the considerations like I I'm actually I'm really big on that I don't like to be like this is the way it's done you actually said that last podcast referring to something different but like I don't like to be like this is how you do it I like to say this is how I evaluate it and these are how I make decisions because then people could apply it to their own situations with their own context. Um it's just a framework. Um the biggest thing is the the we control everything a setter does in the tech stack itself. Remove all critical thinking and it comes with priority buckets and auto assignment rules in the dialer. And so in the dialer, we have a bunch of different rules on how leads are prioritized, how they enroll in a new sequence, how they auto unenroll in a sequence, how they're take it out and put it in a different bucket, which is the unenrollment part. The rep doesn't even know what's happening. Yeah. All they have to do is press start. Yeah. And they're dialing. Now they can see all of the contact cards. So when somebody answers, they know, oh, this is the person, this is the situation, this is that. Sometimes there's some talk track variability based on who it is, but they don't control that because you talked about efficiency. Dude, good luck getting setters to make money and actually being profitable for your company if they're trying to manually go through that part. Yeah. Okay, let's talk on this because that was another part of it that So, we're shopping this right now and we don't have one. So, we're we're on Alaware for the entire from CS to closer to setter and they have their power dialer. You pop open a list. You basically go through the pages, it adds them all in like a little thing in the Google Chrome extension, you click add to power dialer, moves it into a queue and does that. Great for a couple people who are just dialing specific list, but when you start to like over Exactly. It's not the game plan. So it's it's not like an evergreen thing. It's like a list drop. Yeah. And like me and my tech mind are like, okay, I don't want to like do this whole push it into these other lists that are on this other software and then have them like live over here. or I want this two-way sync or dream state where on HubSpot is like an overlay situation that's like those lists already are active. They have every data point in the world. I can instantly see who's now on site, who's been on site 120 times and is on a review page and hasn't booked a call. Like I can have lists for that and like these flows. I'll tell you this, it exists. We have it. We do it and I'll tell you it all. Okay, I'll give the basics on the podcast, but it's a technical answer and most people aren't ready to do it anyways. But but offline I could show you exactly how we do that. Um, and we actually just went through a revamp because every once in a while we look at these metrics and we find more efficient ways to do it. So that's exactly what we do. Um, and it's it's everything. Uh, and and I I'll say this at this point in my company, I really do focus on like CEO tasks running the business. I I which I'm I'm proud of in the sense that like I focus on growing the company, strategic planning and overseeing like we were just talking about the strategic operating cadence, right? So when it started off I had to build all these things myself took forever. I mean dude the f like our CRM configuration SOP it's 98 pages by the way I built Yeah. 98 pages and we configure that on our clients in the first 72 hours of working with them. huge efficiency. But here's the thing, it took me years to get it there. So many different variations. But now I haven't updated that thing in like maybe 18 months to two years cuz my operations team is constantly doing that now because we're always updating whatever. So I I don't I can't give like every technical detail, but from my un So there is a two-way sync. What we build is we build smart views in the CRM that sync with the actual lists in the dialer. I think they're actually called campaigns in the dialers, right? They sync. There's web hooks and I think we use Zapier for something. It's a complex structure. Um, but it works seam it's a complex structure but works seamlessly. It's not clunky and it's just two-way syncing based on the unenrollment the enrollment and unenrollment criteria. So the unenrollment and un sorry the enrollment and unenrollment criteria and how they make it to the list in the CRM and then um the actual dispositions that are in the CRM. It's they're communicating when to take it out of the list and when when marketing action events and dispositions. So like at like uh in our example an opt an app a booking or whatever like those action events enroll or unenroll as well as other criteria and then disposition on what happened after the call. Yes. And so what what we used to do um this is a few iterations ago is we had the priority buckets perfect in the CRM but we still had a manual we'll call it dialing process cuz we'd have to pull up the right list click to dial go through it and then there's all these clunky things where it was like well then I have to go back to the top of the list and it only dials in this order. Like there's there's things that are too hard to communicate on a podcast but the rep's workflow was messy. Yeah. I could even though the buckets were correct. Yeah. So, we're like, "Okay." Oh, and by the way, speed to lead is actually almost impossible cuz even you could have notifications, you could have alerts, but they're in different lists and it gets confusing. So, we removed all that now where all dude, all they have to do is click that button and it's all campaigning and based on the amount of contacts, it continues to take them out or put them back in day by day, however many contacts you set it at. And then it also in the campaign is automating automating all the written and text communication. Interesting. Are you doing anything with blue sending versus green sending? I don't I know them. They they they contact me a lot. Same. Um with green messages. No, I'm kidding. Wouldn't that be funny? No. Um I I have I I legitimately have nothing bad to say about them, but I'll say two things. The first is I don't solve problems. I don't solve things that aren't a big enough problem to me. Yeah. Um their value proposition that's not the main bottleneck we're trying to solve right now. I I I just haven't wanted to reallocate resources on that. And because of our agency model, I validate, duplicate, roll out to everybody. Yeah. Dude, change the entire context of how you do things. Yeah. I have to validate, duplicate, roll. Here's what I mean. Change the whole context. I try it in one use case that makes the most sense on one brand. If it works, I see if I could duplicate it in another use case. If I do, we roll it out to everybody and standardize because we have to have a standardized tech stack to operate in the way that we do at scale. It would blow up your in your Yeah, I didn't want I haven't wanted to go through that. I don't want to do that project. Second thing, um, dude, maybe I'm wrong with this, but like I think that there's I don't believe in the business model of like am I really going to have that drastic of of different and I know they have all their case studies. I know, I get it. But guess what, dude? I've also seen a lot of things that are the opposite of it. Yeah. And I've had conversations with people that haven't had the results and I've I've seen people that have had just as good with green text. I think that it speaks to the actual workflow and the tech stack itself. And so for those reasons, I haven't prioritized it. Yeah. So we rolled it on app notebooks only. So no user anything. It's all AI, all API call everything. Yeah. So the clunkiness of it is is use is like having to use it have multiple users in it. It dedicates one line to one contact. Yeah. So like if it passes from a closer or from a setter to a closer, they're on the same phone number and it's like, "Oh, just give them the story that like you're in the same office and you handed the phone over and like that type of thing because you can't like move phone numbers and like and you can only have 50 contacts per line per day." So then like you have a pool of numbers and then it's like which one is it texting from and like which ones do you own, but they all go in the same bucket and then users over top. So like there for volume and then across multi- account like how you would do crazy but we rolled it on the AI app no books and it did get us a plus 50% response rate from like a 20 something percent. So like that part was working on speed to lead blue message versus green message but we haven't rolled it full. We're about to roll it full. Um, we were likely going to do it for closers, but now we're going to have setters because we go back and forth on like ad comps and like should a closer just handle them or should we automate a portion of it from the closer and like just have it there or should we continue to let like or have setters do it because they can do the speed of lead and whatever all this stuff. But yeah, we'll dude we so the biggest thing that we did too is uh we b we do bulk messaging in our setter workflows based on where they're at in the campaign. We do bulk workflows based what? So if we have so it's it's hard to explain but in the campaign we there's the enrollment and unenrollment criteria. They come in and out of the list every day based on contact attempt. So for example nobody gets more than a couple dials a day. If we hit that list if we hit that lead a couple dials that day they get removed temporarily until the next day. Yes. But there's certain critical points based on the workflows that we've created in the in the touch points when we want them to receive email and text communication. Let's just say that their next text they get is after the third or fourth dial. Well, all of these people will accumulate there and then it it it b it drops these messages on them. So, so there's two. Some are just automated based on the flow, but some of them they uh we have like activation blocks in our day where we'll drop a bulk text from a bunch of these people and and it's it makes it so much more efficient. Imagine have imagine sending the same message and having the same response to 50 people at the same time instead of different conversations all throughout the day. So we found ways that some are evergreen and they go out based on where they're at in the campaign and some of them have the we have these blocks so we can attack the same conversations during that time. Does that make sense? So it it's just an efficiency thing. Um and I and and and man I I was just about to say one other thing. Um oh the only other thing I was going to say is you said something really important. Uh, again, nothing against Simbau at all. I mean, uh, maybe they have a great and there's eight of the platforms now. There's so many different ones. Maybe they have the best product that's ever existed. I literally am not saying an opinion on it. All I'm saying is I am extremely careful to the point of like almost speaking in an absolutes. I almost will never work with a platform that's new. Yeah. because it's too much risk to my clients and I and I can't like I can't afford to standardize something and roll it across everything um for something that is like constantly has holes and constantly breaking and they're changing and their model's different now and so yeah we lean validation and speed remember yeah we'll lean on the edge we'll we'll play with things like that and like but again we do it in a use case for example like an app notebook that's AI that doesn't have us as long as you can mitigate the risk is the point but like I you We talk to these guys and we have strong tech on our team and they have very obviously strong tech on theirs, but like we have a Slack connect that has multiple of their tech team in it and my our tech and their tech are like constantly like, "Oh, we need this change or oh this HubSpot viewer like oh this completely doesn't work or like eight of these lines just went off and it's like oh here's 30 more and then they're going to reassign and like they're constantly doing that." So to imagine that then with also users in the platform like your team and then across however many accounts you guys have that's crazy like that is it's not like enough. And again, I you know, Sam is cracks me up. Their ads, Sam Queen, like their ads crack me up. I ads. He's doing the the blender thing, the picketing outside or whatever he calls. The Trump one I saw was freaking funny. He just he just runs it. So, yeah. No, that's I definitely want to talk to you offline about the software stack specific for that. Um because and we we probably have time, I'm guessing, for for two more quick topics. So what what are the two like power questions that we can end this on um or or value that we can give? Two power questions. How bigger bigger thinking of this where do you this is completely not probably helpful to most people but helpful to me and I think bigger for this. How do you view this? No, seriously though, but like it'll be important to a certain person. How are you viewing scaling this thing and what is like an actual like is it more volume of what you're doing or is it you more out of it? You just had life changes. You are now married and we're on a honeymoon and doing all that like whether your life changes or not like where are you trying to take this? You said I want to go, you know, I'm more CEO now and I'm doing strategic decisions. I'm not in the ops like but you also say things like I'm in it in this way and this way. Where do you want to be and where you grow this thing? Yeah. Um, and that's valuable as a perspective that people have because and from mine before you answer that is like half the time I'm like, "Oh, I want to pull myself out of this so that for multi-reason one that it can sell without me, right? That I'm not in it in it. And then two that like I can try and do the whole like buy back your time truly where you do higher leverage activities that you actually do, which half the time is not true and you're just like not doing anything, right?" And like so I dance that line and then also lifestyle wise like 99% work and like all of a sudden I torch personal life and it's like that's not the model I likely want to live out for the next I I actually like that you took it here to end on because we get out of the trenches for a second but we talked about some good business ownership. I I have a lot of lots of thoughts. Um, I'll tell you this, not and I think this true for any business owner, but like I'm not naive enough to think that everyone that works for me likes me. Um, I I I think I have a really good relationship with most everyone I interact with, but I will tell you I truly believe they all respect me because I am a high output individual. I am in the trenches and no matter how many things I delegate, no matter how many things I fire myself from, no one ever works more than I do in this business. Nobody. I am always identifying what's the most high leverage thing to do next. And I am constantly just inundating myself with new sets of massive initiatives and high leverage stuff. And I I work seven days a week. We're at 11 o'clock on a Friday night. Like I did the same last night, you know, with Jeremy here. So, um I I'm very high output in that sense and uh and I believe that's important for culture as well. Like that's I'm not going to expect people to like I don't even expect anyone to work even as close as much to as I do, right? Like so there's there's that element to it. Um now you make me go to a couple different places because you started off describing this question as like where do you see yourself going, you know, with the business? And one thing is to hit a level of scale that that we're actually at right now and where we want to continue to go, we we have to have both. We have to have quality and quantity. Meaning like we have to have volume just to continue to scale to an extent. But the way that we grow is definitely prioritized and emphasized around quality. We want to go deep, not wide. We end up with a lot of accounts any a lot of accounts anyways but we never compromise the quality of the relationship and and here these are things that I always struggle with like do I say it do I not is it a secret but I'm like I don't think it's a secret but it is a it is something that I consider to be an X factor of us. I always say that that when I'm taking on engagements I'm underwriting. It's, yeah, it's sales in the sense that like I have to get my client the the the leads um buying and trust to say yes to me, but at the end of the day, it's a dual evaluation. And that's not a sales tactic. On a slow week, Ryan, I don't Some weeks I say the same things over and over. I just said this a couple times this week, but on a slow week, maybe I have five new calls a week for new deals. On a busy week, 10. By the way, that's another thing you might hear that's interesting. I have not delegated this because of what I'm explaining right now. It's the single biggest lever because it's not about closing a deal and then pushing them to fulfillment. As soon as I say yes, their problems become my business's problems. Their product becomes my business's product. Their opportunity and scalability becomes my opportunity and scalability. And since there are such large deals in most cases, it's one of the most leveraged things that I could do. So, I still hold on to this right now. And on a slow week, five new opportunities. On a busy week, 10 usually between that range. I usually say once a month. I say or sorry, I say yes to maybe once a month, maybe two. I think the most ever is like three, but it's usually one or two a month and some months zero. Uh of new relationships. And and so my point is I look for scalable models, offers, I believe in economics that make sense to me, business owners I get along with along with that have alignment that have the right scaling intelligence that I could port like like the right partners all I look for that and that's our path forward right now in the like the short term. I'm going to go it's like an onion. I'm going to go bigger and bigger. A little bit bigger than that. Um, I uh I really like this space. There's a lot of things I don't like about it and I have zero intentions to exit the space like to leave it. Um, there's so much opportunity here, dude. So much. It's such a massive industry and and there's just significant the growth profile for a business like mine and a business like yours in this space is spectacular. It's hard to find. So I'm not leaving that by any means, but I have identified other verticals that are great markets with similar growth profiles with similar economics that I can that that need this service. And so that is the next phase is we are uh Q3 for us is SAS. Interesting. Q3 is all about SAS. Um we're investing aggressively there. I'm I am building that department from the top down. Uh meaning like we're not hiring reps and trying to transfer things over. Like I'm I'm I'm hiring director level positions to build that out that are in the SAS space. Um and and and and it's there's a lot of really successful comps. There's outsourced sales agencies doing $und00 million a year in that space. So it's it's already validated. So I like that market a lot. And I think that um I' I've done a lot of research around it. And I think we could I don't want to say disrupt. I think that's kind of cheesy to be like I'm going to disrupt the space. Like there's huge players in it. But I'm going to be heavily differentiated in our approach there just by understanding the competitors that are available. So that's kind of phase two. Now I'll talk about something that's interesting. I think it's for when some when somebody asked me, Josh, are you trying to sell this business? What's your goal? Well, here's how I like to answer that. I think it would be stupid for any sophisticated business owner. The qualifier there is sophisticated, by the way. I think it'd be stupid for any sophisticated business owner to not focus on maximizing enterprise value. Everything you do, even if you want to hold on to it for the rest of your life and pass it down for generations, should be focused on building the most valuable business. By the way, even if you just want to keep it forever and just chill back, you're going to do most of the same actions that you would do to build it to sell because at the end of the day, it's just building a valuable business and and mitigating risk. And you do do those two things that you have optionality either way. So everything I do is focused on making it a valuable business and maximizing enterprise value. And I don't I have so much opport I I love what I do. I'm passionate about it. If I'm in a vehicle that's I'm passionate about I'm really freaking good at that makes a ton of money. Like I the only reason to switch would be a distraction. It would be shiny object syndrome for me to be like, "Now, let's go do that other thing over there." I already love it. I'm already freaking good at it. I spent my whole career in high ticket sales and it it's very it's a very profitable, scalable model. So, to be like, "Yeah, I'm trying to exit, you know, right now." I'm not. I I have so much I want to take it so much further. But here's where I'll say where like I feel like I have a very different narrative on this because uh I'm very passionate about M&A buying, selling. It just fascinates me and I love scaling business. I love studying it. I think people feel that when they hear hear me talk and speak. I I just I I like sophisticated business, dude. I'm a I'm an athlete. Business is my sport and I want to play in the pros. Rookie [ __ ] is annoying to me, right? So, I study this stuff all the time and everybody talks about like, well, you got to remove yourself off the org chart and fire yourself for this to be able to sell and you have to be, you know, and and dude, I and and I believe in most of these things based on, you know, goals. But I used to always say myself, the more valuable you are to the business, the less valuable your business is. But here is the part that I actually completely changed my perspective on after years of studying this stuff. That is important. If you want to have a lights off exit, meaning you want to sell and completely step out. Yeah, 100%. So, what what I feel like nobody really talks about cuz every every single exit advisor or program that focuses on exiting, they're talking about build yourself off the org chart, delegate all responsibilities, you need a C new CEO for six to 12 months before you sell. Well, sure if you want to go lay on the beach after that. I've decided whenever that point comes, if if if that if I get to a point where I'm selling, dude, I'm staying on. I want to take my company to an exit. I'm saying when I get to that, which I'm not there, right? If because I just have so much further I want to go and there's a lot of transformative stuff I want to do. But when I get to that point, nothing excites me more than being backed by the right private equity partner where I'm the horse they bet on, where I can play with people that are just like leagues beyond me. Like, I want a big firm and the the valuation target that I want, it's going to need to be a big fund, which means that there's big players involved to work side by side with them and and and just, you know, have the the fuel and the leverage of of private equity. I want to be the guy to keep taking it and running with it. And I have a couple relationships that did exactly that. And I I won't say names and details just because of who it was, but or just because it's their personal information, even though it is public info, but I I was I was just hanging out with one of them the other day. And uh he his first exit was 100 million to private equity. Stayed on as CEO. Second second exit was 500 million. He still stayed on at CEO. So he rolled over each time. And uh now the company has a a $900 million valuation. He's still the single uh the single largest individual shareholder. He's now off the CEO position. He's the chairman. And this next bite at the apple, he'll be he'll be done. No more rollovers. Um but when I look at that, I'm like, dude, I want that. Yeah. Money, sure, but not even bec like strategically, dude. the rollovers make the most sense because like the second bite of the apple and the third bite of the apple it's usually way more than the first bite of the apple if you have a good private equity partner and those guys know what they're doing but so it's financially makes sense but second of all that sounds like a lot of fun dude yeah skill set development growth skill set develop dude so so that's why my take is is different and if you asked me even a year ago I would have told you yeah dude I'm trying to build myself off the org chart as fast as possible. Not even cuz I have exit intentions yet just cuz I was I heard from everybody that that's what you're supposed to do. But then I when like I've been lucky and fortunate enough that I'm grateful for to to to build really close relationships that are people that are like doing it in a really big way and I was like wait a second I realized like dude that's only if you want your journey to end when you sell. Yeah. And I don't. Mic drop. Mic drop. Yeah. that is I'm I'm I am tired I'm torn a little on where I sit my opinion of my version of that uh and especially because we have multiple partners as well so like who is already players in that who already kind of is doing that or not and as we scale into that but same with you a year ago I would have said this is a cash flow biz and we're optimizing for time to cash return and whatever and now it's completely different it's completely different from a year ago I think dude just as a good business owner everyone needs to focus on the path to maximizing enterprise value to give yourself those options. I don't even and again we talk about this I talk about this on a lot of these and like I think I know XYZ or I hear this new thing and it changes my frame. Like I'll say it a thousand times like I only know what I know in this and like continuously it's shifting and changing and like how I view it and what is important or what is not. So there's a little birdie that's like oh everyone wants to be W2 and we make this switch and it's like wait we did it too early. It's too much cost. it's this it's really not that important especially for XYZ role or like these different things and I'm like oh so like my education around it needs to be it needs to evolve so that it makes sense that we're building in the right direction but like it's definitely in the cards there's some stuff I'll talk to you outside of this that's like oh wow that makes way more sense for what they're talking about like this I always say exit velocity of info coaching but like core and there's these uh additional pieces that make it like a no-brainer and it's like okay so that's what we're building towards and I will talk to that offline line, but this was good. Yeah, we're gonna get kicked out of here. The lights are gonna The lights are gonna turn off in a second. We'll end here, dude. Uh I just the last comment on that topic, though. Um I've seen this in every industry that I've been in, but specifically in coaching and info products. Um so funny, man. They hear these things. How do I want to say this? People try to build them out themselves out too quickly because they think that they're supposed to. me I I literally did this included in the beginning and also my role and dude the company starts to suffer they stop making less money be and and dude never sacrifice money and success now cuz a concept of what you think you're supposed to be in the future and that's the balance I play everything I'm focused on is enterprise value to the extent that I don't sacrifice the business model now and and and a perfect example of that is like when When I say I study this, I really study this. And I've paid tens of thousands of dollars to consultants, mentors, relationships that we we talk about all these things. And uh if I was just focus on enterprise value for an exit and I was okay sacrificing now, um dude, I'd probably shift industries. Yeah. But at the risk of sounding arrogant and and that's not my goal, but like we crush it. So why would I do that? It would make no sense. So my point is like, okay, well diversification and optionality. Let's start doing these other paths that create those options just so we're attractive at some point, you know, in the future. But um but I'm I'm here to stay, man. Like this is like the cash flow and the cash cow now. But again, like I think I've seen so many business owners that like read some book or joined some mastermind or hired some coach and they're like, "Oh, build myself off the org chart." And they think they're like, you know, and it's funny too in this space because you could go like, "Dude, we had a client we took from 300 grand a month to almost 2 million a month in four and a half, five months." And when you do that to somebody, and by the way, this person doesn't have this um mindset. They're they're a really good client and I appreciate this person a lot. But a lot of the times when you create that type of growth for somebody, they [ __ ] dude, they walk around like they're Elon Musk. Yeah. And they're like, "Oh, yeah." And so, dude, instantly it's like you have a big month for them and like the like I've had this happen to a client and we'll end we'll end with this, man. I had this happen to a client. I freaking we had like the the biggest month they ever had, the second biggest month they ever had, and then they sent a Slack message to us that like a an announcement that was like, "As as of this date forward, I will no longer be handling any Slack communication or on any calls. You can now do all your reporting through XYZ." This like really low-level employee. Not in a condescending way. That's just who it was in the org chart. And I'm like, "Wow, dude, that's going to cost you a lot of money because people just think that that's what they're supposed to do." And it's like, do you really think that your business is at a point where you just take your foot off the gas and you just start delegating to people that don't have nearly the amount of competency of you and you don't have the infrastructure? Yeah. So, real real. We'll end with that. We got real today. We went deep. Thank you for hosting us today as well. We went extra extra and I'm sorry for that. But this was good. This was good. This was good. We've been waiting to do this one. We were going to do one of these versions, but this version's even better. Let's do more. But we'll close it out. We both have to speak tomorrow early. Yeah, we do. What time? I don't even know what time that is. You guys rock. I said I was done doing videos, but I said I was doing done doing daily videos. So, peace. Peace. Holy [ __ ]
