In today's video, I'm going to share tactically how we automate our sales rep commissions. This has saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars in terms of admin work, cash collection, payout correction, all of the things. I'm going to show you how to set up automated tables as you scale so that each sales rep will have their dedicated amounts of sales, rev, refunds, net rev, all the things that go into commissions. How you can then beautify and gify simple data like this. We're going to go through the overall thinking and process, which is really the most important part for you depending on your tech stack. I'm going to share the exact zaps that we use and how they fuel into these. And then if you stick around to the end, I make these videos every single day and I'm going to share yesterday's stats um all the way down to the stripe. All right, last year we did 30 million cash collected. I make all the videos on this channel to share what did work, what did not work as you'll see uh act and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, top opportunities and building a network of people who are doing the same. All right, so automating sales rep commissions. I have an o like an OG video on the on the channel that's like four years ago on how we did this. But really what this is is this is like a simple Google sheet version. I put all this together for this and blacked out any like customer info or sales rep info or anything like that. So what you can by the end of this is have your bookings, your sales, so you can get your sales per booking. You can get all this stuff all into one thing. The big thing here is data. Okay. So being able to collect how much revenue was collected from the initial charge and future payment plans if that's how you choose to pay sales reps. We do not anymore. I can go to that later. Refunds and the clawback because you should not be paying commissions on refunds, right? It needs to be the net revenue number and then commissions based on that. Okay. So here's an example of what a viewer looks like for us right now. So this is just to gamify it a little, but essentially you're going to have your sales rep ID, their name across, and then you can have their month-to- date sales for booking, their show rates. All this is just viewing the data. Okay, so like Google has theirs, this is a looker studio. So your looker of viewer, all you're doing is looking or viewing the data that exists. Okay, so the key thing we're going to set up is how to get data into somewhere that it can be viewed. But then you can have your point systems, your bases, your overall team stuff, your bonus thresholds to when they hit these other things and gify it. But yeah, so simply put, this is the flow. Okay, you're going to have an order form or multiple that is going to be for a sales rep. Okay, so in this, we'll use our exact example. On an order form, you're going to have multiple payment or multiple products or payment types. Okay, you're going to have your paid in full. You're going to have your payment plans, you're going to have all that stuff. Now, the key here is on your order form, you either need to be able to identify who the sales rep was with a field. So sales rep ID is the best. You don't want to use name. You could use email. It's a little bit more unique, but like you have to start thinking a little bit more data focused. And in data, everything has a unique identifier. So a sales rep ID or whatever that is. Okay? So for us, that's what we use. Now the other option is to have multiple order forms, which is the flow I'm going to show you is actually how we are still set up. So each sales rep will have their own order form. And what that allows is instead of it having to have the form inside the form to do it, like let's say you sent it to sales uh to customers, you will have the actual sales ID is going to be the order form, right? So that's how you're going to be able to identify which sales rep did which by order form. Okay? It's going to pass through the processor and the processor is actually what's going to run the in meaning the charges that come in as well as out. So the refunds that come out and then you're going to put them in a viewer. Very simply put. Okay. So in this example, you have two sales reps. They both have their own order form. They run the payments. It lands in the processor and it goes into this logger, which can be a Google sheet. It can be an air table. It could be anywhere you store data. And it is going to show the date of the transaction. It's going to show what the transaction type was. It's going to you're going to put everything. It's going to show the uh amount. And then one of those columns is going to be the sales rep ID or in some way, shape, or form identify the sales rep. Okay? their name, their email, their ID. ID again is the best. Now, the beauty of that is once it's stored in this processor at the customer level, which I'll get into, it'll come in for all in and all out. Then all you need is a viewer that can look across that and say, "Okay, where sales rep ID across this range was there? There was one refund and for how many dollars?" Across this range on the in, you have two different things. You have an in tracker and an out tracker. Okay. How many came in? How many came out? What's the net amount? pay commissions on that is like the very simple way to look at this. Okay. Now, inside a processor or a CRM or where anything you're gonna have a customer, okay, this kind of like 1.0 data or 101. So, you're going to have a customer. Inside that customer, it can have the customer will have charges. They'll have refunds. They will have payment plans or like uh schedules inside them. And what they can also have is a sales rep, okay, as a custom field. uh some softwares already have them. Our example is Stripe, and I'm about to show you our whole flow here, but there's like 19 other things that can be in this, but this is the very simple way to look at it. So then everything that happens to a customer once a sales rep is assigned will be attributed to the sales rep. Okay? So every future payment that comes out, a refund that comes out into the future, anything that happens after that fact of the sales rep being added to the customer is very simply attributed back to the sales rep. Okay? And you can do this in like all the ways. So like once you do coaching and you have coaches into the future, how much cash collected do they have under a coach like you can do all of that once you have your data set set up correctly. Okay. So master's app that we have here is basically a new charge is going to come in in Stripe. Okay, that's the first thing that happens. That is like the trigger for all this because we want it on real cash. Now the other thing on here and what we're actually actively moving over to is where is your data source? What is your like core piece? And this what I'm I'm about to show you has three data sources, which is like not ideal. And we already said we're going to wait until we're back at like three million and some change to move over to a a centralized data source. So like a a source of truth is what they call it. So we're going to move everything of ours into HubSpot. Right now it's a Google sheet, two Google Sheets and Stripe, right? All have different technically kind of pieces. Stripe kind of, but like really it's two different Google Sheets. So, what we're going to do is we are going to have a new charge trigger this and it's going to delay. And it's technically delaying. And this is not the perfect way to set this up. I set these up way back when and like Band-Aid solution just to solve for this. And we've since updated and updated and like all this is going to get an overhaul, but like this works and has worked for up to like four million a month like it doesn't break. So, or 3.8 million or I believe was the number. I'm not going to say we did four million because we didn't. new charge comes in delayed and then these are happening in the background. Okay, so we are so old school. We are still using Clickfunnels for our order forms. So for us, we're using like I said before multiple order forms. So each sales rep has their own dedicated order form. All right. So what's going to happen on here is a new purchase is going to come in. Okay. When it comes in, it is going to do a lookup inside that in logger. It's then going to find that customer based on the purchase and it's going to update the customer. The updating the customer is adding in this custo sales rep ID into the stripe customer. Right? So what that allows us to do is then when it pushes into the in logger, you're going to have the date of the transaction, the amount, the everything, but it's also going to have the sales rep ID inside there. Okay? So we are assigning the sales rep ID to the customer so that that payment and then all future payments, refunds, anything can get pushed into that sheet. Okay, now that's what's going to happen here and some other stuff. I'm not going to go into the other pieces, but like we push everything into HubSpot. This is where we tag things. This is where we say this is a new purchase on this date came from the sales rep. Like so you can store this information either in HubSpot or in Stripe or both. Like we have it in both. Not ideal because you want one source of truth and with with us it's going to be HubSpot. But for how we're collecting payments right now, we do it inside Stripe so that all of this automation piece is in. Okay. Now, this one other piece that's going to happen is we're also then going to look up that transaction uh or that row in that sheet and we are going to tag that first purchase that came from the order form as new. So, we have another column in there that basically like I said like the type of the transaction is going to come in in this in logger and it's going to show the date, the charge, the amount, the sales rep ID, and then if it came from an order form, we know it's a brand new transaction. We're going to tag it as new. Why that's important is because for us, we only pay sales reps on the first 30-day cash collection. Okay? So, if someone does a PIF 7200 or whatever, we pay them right then and they're in that in that pay period. Now, if someone signs up for a payment plan for like 2K a month, the sales rep is only paid on the first amount during that month. So, just that 2K, right? So, we incentivize for PIFFs and then also just on cash collection over time, it's on it. It falls into the coaching bucket. Okay? So, that was a big shift we made. And this entire thing was actually built off the idea of how do we pay coaches forever on payment plans? But for us, it just wasn't incentivizing the right behavior. It was making it so they were getting paid out like these amounts over months and then they didn't have to work as hard to get new cash. and it was like not ideal, right? They had like renewal income that was coming in, which give and take, like I I I saw the pros and cons of both models, but this just like how we do it. Um, and what this also incentivizes, which is huge for us that I could do a whole another video on, but is the sales rep reaches out within the first 30 days to like see how they like it and do whatever. And we'll then push them to PIFF within that first 30 days, which they do get commission on. And that happens like all the time, like all the time. So, we'll have like a payment plan where someone got 3,600 or 3,100 or whatever. They'll talk to them 20 30 days in and be like, "Hey, do you love this?" Instead of making these extra whatever 1 or 2k in payments over the year, do you just want to pay for the whole thing up front, like the spread? And they'll be like, "Yeah, you know what? Sure." And then they'll just do a 5k payment. We process it with billing. They paid the 7,200, not on the first call date, they paid 2,200, then they paid another 5gs within that first 30 days, and we honor the PIFF pricing for 30 days. Okay? So little random golden nugget. But so that new purchase comes in comes into here looks up and goes new. Okay. So we know inside of our looker inside of our stuff if it says this transaction has a sales rep ID and says new it's a new transaction. Okay. Now delays come through find that customer again look it up. We also find the uh this is the tool that we use for um the fulfillment. So, we're also looking this up because if new transactions come in or a transaction comes in, the back-end stuff is all we do like commissions for sale uh for coaches. So, on the fulfillment side, because a sales rep gets them in, gets commissions. Once that someone stays, we have that staying commission is through the coach. Okay? So, we look up the coach, we find the client, we look up the coach ID, we log the coach ID. Now, all that then does is pop into here and uh put it in this uh basically it's like looking if they've already done it before and it'll combine transactions. This one's a little bit more advanced. Same with this one. This as simple as it creates that row. Very simple. And this is all you need. You need like four of these steps, two of these steps, three of these steps. Okay. So, where am I? Back to this. All you need to do this is either dedicated order forms or an order form that identifies which sales rep it was inside the order form. Okay, it's going to pass in. When it's passed in, it stores that in that customer level. This is a recap here. Customer level has a sales rep attached to it. Now, anything that happens into the future for that customer is tagged to that sales rep. Very simple. Okay. And then this is how I have other videos talking about the uh marketing tracker like 1.0 or 101 version. All you need is two tabs in a Google sheet for the for the basic version of this that'll literally log the date, the time, I'm sorry, the date, like the email, everything you can about the transaction. So date that came in, what type it was, the amount, the fees, uh what the source was for Stripe or deposit or whatever, all the way down. and then a sales rep ID column, a new if you want to track what's new or not. You can also get that from type depending on what you use. All in an in tracker. Now, every time a Stripe thing comes in, floods through that, pushes into that sheet, pushes into that sheet. You can push this into a sheet, air table, HubSpot, wherever. Same thing with uh out every time a refund is triggered inside Stripe, push into a sheet. Same exact thing, date, amount, fees, source, email, everything you can into there. And then all you need is one central literally you can go on Upwork and in like for like $150 you can have someone make this because they can see two very clean data sheets and be like okay what do you want now? Okay, you want it across ranges. How many uh new units happen for this and this? Okay, oh you want to know the sales reps across here. They have a sales rep ID table that has the sales rep ID and name and they go okay there was 17 transactions for this sales rep ID and it logs across here with how many sales they had, how many rep, how much rev, how all that like all that matters is that you get the data in one place. How you view it then after is like the easiest thing possible. Okay, now that's basically what I got for this. I don't want to go too crazy in depth because I'm just like yapping in circles about this, but like it's so it's so simple once you understand that all it is is the data portion and then how you view it in the division and across this and ranges is is the easy part, I guess, right? I guess they're both easy parts, but that's that. Uh ask any questions you have. I have like three different people that were asking me this about like the thinking behind it or like not as much detail in terms of like the technical, but yeah. So, yesterday's stats, terrible day on the streets. 682 leads, 365 apps, 108 calls with only two buyers. This is like again, I don't know if if you guys have seen other videos on this about me talking like this on this should be 10 plus like 10 plus units over a 10% sales per booking. So, something is like fundamentally broken uh in terms of marketing, sales, the the tie between them two. So, we're like actively working on this as you can imagine. I'm making these videos at like 6:00 in the morning um so that I can then actually work all day. But um low ticket buyers 49. Uh we're scaling this up still, but 30K in total cash collection. I'm just going to start dropping a Stripe screenshot on these is literally yesterday's Stripe, but 30K yesterday, which is so bad. So bad. Um this needs to be like at minimum like 75 G's just to like feel okay and like pay bills. So we're in it right in the trenches. Uh you know, it's important to who you listen to. So, this is where we're at and take that into account when listening to me. Yes, we scaled up and yes, we did those bigger numbers, but like right now we're back in the trenches trying to figure it out and rebuild things. So, talk soon everyone. Instagram for uh communication, comments, shares, feed the algo so I can get these out. Talk soon.
