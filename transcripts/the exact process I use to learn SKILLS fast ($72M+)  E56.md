# the exact process I use to learn SKILLS fast ($72M+) | E56
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faq6SSgd0FU

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the process that I use to learn anything fast. This is the exact framework that I have used to learn countless different skills that have generated tens of millions of dollars. We're going to walk through how you can do this for free, how you can speedrun your way through by paying using GPT as your partner, and so much more. And the entire time, I'm going to be walking through real life examples of how I have applied this in the past and how I'm doing it today. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 72 million actually in total cash collected. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So let's get into it. So first things first, identify. Now all this is my opinion. This is how I operate. This is not necessarily the fastest or the best way. It is my way. So identify. First things first is defining the actual outcome. So there is different ways to look at this on if you're optimizing for a goal, a result or just the skill itself. And I think it's very very important to identify what you're actually targeting and then reverse engineer that result. So there's a lot of different examples of this, but it's just really important that you focus on what the actual result is, not necessarily the model or the method. And that can be very confusing when you're optimizing for a skill like how to run paid ads when what the actual outcome is is what you want from running the paid ads. because there's then there's different methods, there's different skills that you can learn that can do that and also higher leverage ones. So, how I like to approach it is always finding who is the best, who is actively doing it and who was you in their past. Okay, so what I mean by that is basically now that there's I have X and all that kind of stuff. Before it was just YouTube searches and looking all over the internet or where you get ads and finding who is the best in this specific space. So in the example that I'm using for this or what we did was I basically wanted to find who was the best in the callunnel space and then learn from them. Okay? So try to identify them look online. Now you can use Chad GBT that didn't exist then when we did this and then who is actively doing it. Now what I mean by actively is not somebody who is teaching you how to make money and they're making money by teaching you how to make money and like this vicious loop. It's very common now um and especially in the online uh the internet marketing online space. So, you want to find someone who's actively doing it likely or is freshly doing it. Uh, who's still in the trenches. So, there's people like Iman who've talked like, you know, they stopped selling agency stuff when they stopped running their agency and they said, you know, they're not the best or the one who's actively doing it anymore. And that's what I mean there. So, who was you in their past? This is also a very important one. Um, if you look at somebody who's operating, you know, who's a billionaire right now and operating in this way, one, you can't just operate like how they are and get their result because how they did on the way up is different than where they are now. Okay? So, being able to find someone who has a similar past or has a similar experience that you have now uh is very important. So somebody with a trust fund versus somebody who you know doesn't come from money are going to have a different version of how they can do things because they have different resources, they have different experiences, they have a different environment. So it's it's very helpful to find somebody who came from a similar background or has similar skills or is in a similar industry um than not. And then sanity check. This is just a quick like again why am I learning this or why is this important to me or is this the real outcome of what I want and constantly kind of doing that sanity check as to who you're listening to and why you are defining this as your goal. Now, immersion is the free version. YouTube books, newsletters, podcasts. Um, in the examples of here, what I'm talking about for this MR community, like right now, I'm hyperfocused on how can I learn about the best MR communities that exist. So, how they do framing, how they do activation, how they do gamification, retention, all these things are like super important to me because we're launching one. And I'll get into how you can have like some higher leverage on these. But the first thing I'm doing is just eating alive. Anything I can find on YouTube, I posted on X yesterday. I'm buying all the books. I will skim through, I will read, you know, aggressively through ones that I like. Um, I will try and find newsletters where it's all that people talk about, both there are free and paid versions, different podcasts. Like another example of this is, you know, I wanted to help my mom create a recipe blog when she was in retirement. And all I did for like an entire weekend or more was find all the YouTube like every YouTube video about, you know, recipe blog SEO, um, every newsletter, every podcast, like there's a recipe blog pro or something like that. And I still have the podcast to this day on my phone where there's hundreds of episodes about SEO and photography and all these like just immerse yourself. Okay? So, you're going to want to be around the people and you're going to want to be around the people talking about it or watching the people talking about it. Now, the speedrun, I made another video on this like course junkie guru, but the difference with speedrunning or paying for it is one is you're going to value it more. So, it's not just going to be some side hobby. And two, you're going to get the structure. So, the idea with someone ideally, and again, this is going back to like who are you listening to? who are you listening to because that's so important. But get you get the structure that sometimes doesn't exist on YouTube. Same way that if you were paying somebody to, you know, learn how to learn um there would be a better way to do this than this YouTube video. Like you're going to pick pick up nuggets and pieces, but somebody else has thought this through and created a 100 hours or spent a 100 hours creating content around this in a very structured way that has like proper checkpoints and activations because it's a paid course. Ideally, again, you need to pick the right ones. Um, but there is a lot of value in paying for it and skipping the line. So, courses, coaches, gurus, uh, huge fan of this. I think, you know, it's a pay-to-play game. Sometimes there are lower ticket ones, but like name somebody who's the best of the best that doesn't have a coach. Like, you can't. And coaches are a little different because sometimes they haven't actually done it. Like, you know, the Michael Jordan, you know, has coaches that haven't been Michael Jordan, but there are aspects of what they're getting from that person that they're world class at that they're the best in the world. Okay. So, like you can piece and part skills and pieces from people. You're going to have a course creator or a coach or somebody that crushes it and teaching you something about business, but they might have a terrible family life. And like you need to determine what pieces and parts you want to learn from them because you don't need to be them. Okay? So, skipping the line. You get to learn what didn't work when they did it. A lot of the time like the real ones will talk about what didn't work or what they tried. And if they were only doing one thing, that's usually not a good sign. um what does work, so what they've leaned into and found pockets, the math behind it, like they need to know it better than anyone. How they think uh is a big thing. So, not just listening to what they say and the content, but how they're thinking about situations and and and structures and then also you learning how to think. It's kind of like the metal uh meta example, and I was going to make another entire video on this, but there's so many skills that you can learn that then fast forward everything else. So that's everything from learning how to type faster to using AI to um you know proper speech to leadership stuff like any of those kind of like more meta skills in you as a person and what you do on a daily basis like just speeding up your mouse is going to make you 10% faster and like you start stacking those together and it sounds stupid but like if you're on a computer 10 hours a day and you can go faster and your computer doesn't lag and this and this and this like you just gain 10 or 20% of production. Now you have to make sure you're working on the right things. you have the right skill, you have all that stuff, but like there's some foundational blocks you can work on. So, important to know how they think and how they're structuring things. And then again, caution level one, level 10,000 on this. Gurus, do not follow the guys who make money teaching you how to make money. Like, there's a place for it, but and I've paid them and I've learned things from them. So, I'm not going to say that they don't have great there there are nuggets in there, but I don't know. I'm just more of like an an expert. I like to find the experts. I like to find the best of the best and they also put out free content that you can consume. So, and then mentor levels 1000. That's just circling back on this. Every top book, every top person will talk will tell you that mentors are the best thing ever. I think of mentors a little differently than I would think of courses. Uh but a mentor is someone who more so just exists in your life and in checkpoints to basically like be a guiding guiding light of that. And you're going to pick up more nuggets that are like ancillary than just the core thing, right? It's not where you're buying a course and you're learning the A to Z on how to do this. It's more so the evolution of it and checkpoints through u but mentors continuously like over time is the best way to learn something and like elevate your your view on things. So now let's get tactical how I use GPT as a as my partner in this. So I will prompt it like a researcher. I will come in and say act like you're the best copywriter in the world. Act like you have done, you know, XYZ. And it's only getting better right now. So if you can position it well, create one big thread and then give it context, context, context. So for example, of what we're doing here with this MR community, I did a massive uh brain dump. Again, back to the little meta skills, but like being able to audio talk into GPT versus type is like 50% lift. And you get more context because you kind of like yap in circles. And just that alone gives you gives GPT more context and can feed it back versus what you're willing to type or going to spend the time typing. So context, context, context. I was like, you know, here's what we're doing. I want basically actually how I started yesterday, for example, was I said, I want to launch this uh paid basically subscription community. I want it to be the stickiest thing ever. I want it to like, you know, the best reviews, the this and that. It gives me like this insanely good output. And instantly I was like, wait a minute, this is for someone who's just paying this. I want it in my specific context, in my specific case, to be on the back end of another product skew, so call it like a high ticket. And then afterwards, they're going to be in this low to mid tier ticket that is recurring. And we want it to be like life focused, like forever focused. Just giving it the context of those changes. You're going to go from here to here. It's actually like a downell continuity play after retention. They learned all this stuff in, you know, phase one. And then in phase two, this is the continuation of it. And it was like on a dime flipped in completely different way of how you do activation, how you celebrate milestones, um the the framing of it, like all those different things. and then layers in all the other pieces because you're still going to have the gamification. You're gonna still have those. So context is so important. Summaries um back up here. So when you have these books and these YouTubes and like or YouTube videos and newsletters, you want to consume them, but you can only like retain so much and it's kind of just good to just be immersed and just have the videos on and have them in your ears all the time and just like constantly having it. Um, but what you can also do is feed those entire things as summaries or as themselves to then summarize out to you inside of GPT all in this master thread or collection of threads. So, they're feeding off each other. So, you basically have everything it knows. It has everything you're feeding it about your context and then kind of going deeper down the rabbit hole are like isolating pieces of what it already knows because it can find these a lot of the time. Um, but you can take entire, you know, this is the best book about it. give me summaries from this and apply it to my event or my my situation. Go to extremes. These these three are kind of like fun, but I take it to the highest level of extreme in anything, whether it's the math of it, whether it's like it's just so much easier to understand the I do this with everything in life, but if you take it to the extreme, you can see the difference. So like what if it was like the lowest possible? What if it was the highest possible? And you can do that with different metrics on things. You can do that with whatever because everything's going to land closer to the middle or you know it's going to lean in one of the two directions. So being able to understand how far you can take something and whether that's your copywriting, whether that's your media buying, whether that's your team, um taking it to extreme and then also the ability to go down rabbit holes. So like the whole like double click on this and go deeper concept. You can really do that inside GPT where you find a piece of something about community management and you just want to go deeper deeper. Where have people done this? What is the most successful of this? Uh now give me breakdown of this company. How do they structure their entire offer stack? like you can kind of web your way through and it's literally just like consumption, consumption, consumption, but on your terms, right? You're not just scrolling through some feed and getting it every third thing and then using it to think better. So, constantly asking how could I approach this in a in a better way? How can I approach this in a way that's more scalable? How can I approach this in different ways? Uh is super helpful. Now, building the stack, how I do this then is as I'm going through here, I'm collecting things. So if I'm on uh YouTube videos or paid courses, coaching, I am keeping a notion that is basically like I have all my learnings and then I have each I have a page or even subpages from there of each thing. So like everything from like how to run YouTube ads to copywriting um to uh you know automations to operations and team development like I have different ones. You click into those and then I'm just keeping and compiling notes structured from the course. like subheaded video 2.1 is about this and I keep my own version of notes and I link things out and I feed all of those in to basically like what did I take from it you're just taking notes simply put but you're putting in there and then over time you can like codify different frameworks that you use so it's like I break this down I then summarize this section and these are my action plan from these and then what you can do is take that entire feedback feed it back into GPT into that thread and be like here's what I picked up from across these so this kind of goes back to like the summaries portion Um, and then you can basically create as your assistant. So, as you begin to actually do this, which I'll cover right here, but as you begin to actually implement, which is like the number one thing, um, you can use it as your assistant to give updates on like here's the data that's coming through so far. Here's where I'm at with this. Oh, here's a roadblock I hit. And it can navigate you because it has enough context to do that. Okay. Okay. So, I have like complete dedicated threads where I have everything from equity and and legal conversations to uh low ticket math and launches and like where we're at with CPAs. Just everything you can imagine and the depth of it. I I mean, I just built one entire thing on coach comp like the different compensation models for the fulfillment and how you can tier it and what other top people do for bonus structures versus percents. Like, you just have to give it the right thing and ask the right questions, which again is why this framework exists the way it does. Identify the right thing and make sure that you're constantly doing a sanity check. Am I optimizing and trying to learn the right thing being immersion you just constantly have it around you and in your head and you're getting nuggets and ideas paying to jump the line and get the structured version of that immersion and then feeding it in and giving the context for yourself getting your unique context categorizing those learnings and then feedback loops implementing is the number one thing. So again, circling back to sanity check, are you learning this just to learn it and it's fun for you? Cuz like that's a completely different model if you're just trying to like learn art or um learn, you know, travel or do these different things that are kind of like passion projects versus if you're doing something that's tactical that you need to implement now because you could learn everything about paid ads, but if you never run a paid ad, you haven't learned anything. Overgeneralization, but like you you can't even count it because why are you learning it unless there's some other higher leverage play. Um, but you need to launch. You need to gather real data. And then I put this on here, but hard uh hard and also easy mode is doing this all public. So being able to share what you're learning and share like that you're in the trenches and doing it both makes it harder because it's like you have social pressure, you look stupid, you whatever your mental beliefs are, which none of those are true, but uh and then it's easier actually because there are a lot of people out there that are going to help. There are a lot of people that are going to be able to identify where you're at in the journey of 0 to 10 on skill. Um, and yeah, I just wanted to add that there. But feedback loops are so important. So again, you've identified, you're constantly taking a sanity check on if you're listening to the right people and what you're doing. You're immersing yourself and surrounding yourself with the environment of things to just like absorb it, you know, put the book under your pillow type vibe. And then you are speedrunning where you can pay for the right people. Once you've identified who are the actual best in the space, you are then using GPT to take those learnings, go back and forth, and make it contextual for you. You're constantly building a dock uh or stack of things that are your learnings from it and how you can apply it and then you are implementing and this is an iterative cycle. So I wish I would have put this in like a ch in a in a circular chart but it is an iterative cycle and then the question is where do you break out? You have two roads ahead. Okay. Is this a side quest? I do hundreds of these. I will learn the most random [ __ ] ever and just like do it. But I have I realize that they are side quests and they're like feeding this like desire and interest of me and I have now allowed myself to basically look at them as that versus looking at them as distractions or like starting up another business. I use this example but like in I think it was November, December, I was like, "Oh, I want to like run ads from zero and I want to, you know, drop ship and do something just cuz I'm interested in it." spun up a page, did this, you know, bought whatever course, did a free course, watched a ton of YouTube videos, landing page optimizations, AOV boosts, like these different things, launched it, did 100 grand in a month, like back and forth, and just was like, "All right, I learned it, broke even on it, by the way, 100 grand in, 100 grand out." Um, but like learned what I wanted to learn, and then was able to take portions of that and apply it into our current main business and some of the info stuff, right? So, I learned stuff in e-commerce and how to do it and then there were pieces of it that I could then apply inside the info and coaching. And that's where I go with this with this polymath and where else can where else can this apply? Polymath was just like way overused when you know basically Elon it was this huge thing is like he knows all the stuff about physics. He knows all the stuff about you know energy. He knows all the stuff about whatever. uh and he can use those skills like interchangeably and that's how he can create a Tesla or SpaceX because he knows things about all these different spaces at like a pretty deep level that when you combine them you're like one of one versus like you're never going to be the best in the world at I'm not never somebody is but uh you're never going to be the best best at math call it um or like you know economics but the example of combining those two or combining that with geography or combining that with info business or combining that with these different skills you can become the best person because there's overlaps on how you learn something over here and how you can apply it in this business. So that's what I mean by where else can this apply. There are things that I have learned in random stuff that I have ventured off and side quest on that we have then brought back and applied. So there's stuff that's in the software space on how they do things around retention and how they do things around activation that we have used inside communities. There are ways that there's just a million things. So my goal is always just to become dangerous in it. So, I want to be able to go in and tinker and break things, know what's happening in a meeting context that's like deep in a department, but like understand what's happening because that's where this then goes. You've learned all this, you're iterating on it, and then you have to decide, are you going to be the best at this, and you are going to take, you know, what I just said here is 50 to 100 hours over a week or two versus are you going to become the best, and that's thousands of hours, and you're going to lean in and lean in and lean in and continue to go there, or are you going to know enough about it, be dangerous, and then you're either going to delegate it, and you're going to have someone on your team who's actually it, which is my preferred method. So, like I'm learning this stuff right here so I can be dangerous. I'm not learning it so I can lead the MR community and do the activation, the gamification myself and lead the department. I'm doing it so I can understand and then find the best pieces that are contextual for us to then push into the company and push into the team that's leading it and be able to delegate it out to make sure that it's done correctly, but understand it. Can't delegate it very well without understanding what's happening and knowing what to track. Um, so yeah. So the other option is always automate it. There are certain things that are automatable uh that you can do this with. So being able to automate anything that's a technical thing or um you know there's full flows and things now with you know how you do AI and how you use NAN or Z or uh Zapier that you can automate out these things that you've learned. So that's a fun one. And then yeah my goal here is ownership versus expertise. So in a lot of this I want expertise level of like you know top 5% top 10% you know I'm sure that's probably more accurate of my understanding of things and then have ownership over where that exists within the company and within there because you can this is just like a really high high lever thing. The idea of you learning Facebook ads means that you can either work on a team of somebody that and run and be a junior media buyer. You can have your own agency or I mean you can be a solo guy and have six clients that runs Facebook ads. You can own an agency that does Facebook ads. You can like I mean like you can go it's how deep do you want to go or how high up do you want with leverage and that's skill stacking because then you need leadership because then you need sales to sell it. You need all these different things but it starts with just being able to run Facebook ads. And when you stack it you can have an agency that does 100 million a year that just runs Facebook ads. But it requires more skills that you stack on top of that as you climb. So, and then always being able to revisit. So, things are constantly learn changing. I used AI and AI as an example here, but they're constantly changing. So, being able to come back to them how things change at Facebook ads, different optimizations, how they roll out different campaign structures. Now, it's smarter with the pixel when before you would try and like push this in. Again, using that as an example, but constantly being able to do that. So, quick summary, identify. You want to make sure you know what you're actually optimizing for and why you're learning it and identify the best people in the space to learn from. Constantly do this sanity check as you step through here as you're coming back and forth as does this really make sense for me to be doing. Is this what I actually am supposed to be learning and developing on right now? Immerse yourself in all the [ __ ] Go into every little bucket of this. There are the depths of the internet that you don't know exist about woodworking for cars, woodworking for like you have no idea the depths. So being able to immerse yourself in that speed running by paying for different access, finding mentors, finding people who were uh who were where you are and getting to and got to where you want to be. Um, and making sure you identify the right gurus, using GPT this entire time to have context and go back and forth with you, cataloging all of your learnings, implementing for actual feedback and looping constantly through this process and then deciding if this is something that you are learning for fun or if you are learning to delegate or you are looking to do yourself, right? real life examples of this. I bought two or three different courses that basically taught the VSSL, taught the tech, and then taught the sales of how to do a callunnel. Launched the entire thing in a weekend, and by the next week, we were doing, you know, 20K in a week, which was, you know, basically on pays for that 100K month, increased pricing, got another sales thing to learn how to do sales management, like order forms, routing, all the stuff we had no idea existed, all while iterating on the VSSL from another course, all while running ads that we learned from another course. And we iterated that and you know 5 months later we're doing a million a month all from things we learned in courses and then me just obsessing over different things inside this space and constantly asking questions to the right people who had already done this. Um so that's how we did that one and then the MR community. I was posting about this live but I'm just trying to find the best of the best who actively run this study what they do. Um, I already collected a bunch of the books, did summaries before they physically arrived and fed them into GPT to give them context to my situation and I haven't bought anything yet. So, that's kind of this next step other than books. But, um, I haven't bought anything yet. So, if I can find somebody who can do this and then my real goal here is just to learn it um, completely so that I can delegate it out. It's already going to happen without me. But if I can add some extra juice or have some context so I can understand kind of the levers that we can pull to make this the best possible, that's the goal. So that's that early morning one today. So sorry if the energy is low, but it's not. Just sounds low. Um daily update. Yesterday we did like 50 or 60 G's. Um day before that we did the highest day we've had since September. Um which is like 120 130 something like that. So things are on the right pace. We got a sales manager in now. uh through posting which is great because the content is working uh and I'm really excited for him. I think just that alone will get us back into um basically all-time high record or you know top pacing months and then from there it's just growth of the team restructuring of that. So anywhere from four to eight weeks would be the target on that and we just keep on pumping. So today's video 52 54 something in a row. Um so all of them are cataloged here so you can see and I break them all down by different category that we have. I've been making them every single day. So, hit me on X or IG if you have any questions. Happy to help with anything.
