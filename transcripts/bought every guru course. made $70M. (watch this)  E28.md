In today's video, I'm going to share how we went from zero to $70 million in cash collected from buying courses. I've spent literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on gurus, courses, masterminds, everything you can think of. Everyone shits on it. I'm going to tell you why I think they're wrong and what I'm calling the bottleneck and interest mapping. So, we're going to go through like a third of the courses I could find that we've purchased and then show in these black boxes the ones that were absolutely pivotal in my career, the business, all the things. Stick around to the end. I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I do this every day. So, we're going to see the leads, apps, calls, buyers, and our cash collected yesterday in our main business. And last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. I share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. All right, so let's get into it. So, like I said, I I can't even fathom the dollar value that I've spent. I know it's over 200. I don't know if it's over three, but it's close to. Um, and I just always do this. And and what what I mean by bottleneck and interest mapping means like where I am stuck, where we are, this is like a cheat code. So people are going to like [ __ ] on gurus and talk about how it's, you know, just like I it's not good when someone is teaching something they don't know or they're making money by teaching someone how to make money and like it's this like vicious loop, but for somebody who has done something, who is an expert in the field, who has the exact track record of somewhere where you were and you need to be like it just it just makes sense, right? Like so for someone like me who's introvert leftrain who can follow a structure and a system and just scale the [ __ ] out of it like it works. Someone who is creative like I don't know how as easily to do zero to one to come up with something. And I'm also being introvert don't connect and network and all of that like there's a reason I'm making these videos. Um so I don't have the back and forth of oh this is working now or oh this structure or system or this page flow. like all I find is what I find on the internet um what we run and what we learn while doing it and then what I buy and finding courses and masterminds and communities. So this is a lit I think this is only like a third of them but I found these all in like a courses folder I have and this is basically in order and I thought this is hilarious so I'm going to share this. So first course I ever bought was IG shoutout something. I couldn't even find it in here but once I saw these I was like oh I need to include this. I was 18 maybe, so like 10 years ago, maybe 19. And I had just had like an in real life business fail and was trying to do like private equity stuff and scale into all this whatever. And I literally got a ad or was like an organic, I believe, clicked into something, ended up going through a webinar funnel that I didn't even know was that at the time, bought for $4.97. And this was basically teaching how to do shoutouts to a lander that had an opt-in. And the opt-in then basically sent them to an email list. You were building an email list to monetize through affiliate traffic and the thank you page was literally just sending direct to a ClickBank affiliate link to essentially self-liquidate the cost of what you were paying for shoutouts back in the day on IG which was literally like the original version. So you'd pay a hundred bucks to get that. You'd send everyone there. You'd get however I don't even remember how many email leads and then they would send into this bucket. Then you'd email your list and you could expect a dollar per email on your list per month. And like failed miserably. like it worked and I got the there, but then I didn't want to email the list. I didn't want to pretend to be somebody I wasn't. It was just like this whole thing. But like that opened my brain into online marketing, digital marketing. So like yeah, I spent $500 and didn't make any because of me. That's the other thing is like people are like, "Oh, this didn't work for me." Or like, oh, like all of these have worked for someone and could work for you even if you use 1% of them or the entire framework or whatever. And to be like, oh, like I I didn't learn anything. It didn't work for me. It's like that's because of you, not because of that. even if it's again this much of it. So this then basically put me into like online marketing, learning ads, media marketing agency. I ran ads for people. I built random sales pages. I tried to learn, you know, pay-per-click and all this stuff. All of this could have been its own business and I could have been doing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month 10 years ago or eight year whatever this was eight years ago or something and I didn't, right? I just learn little snippets and like increase my skill level, but never fully deployed, never went solo, never like tried to do my own thing. Okay, Jeremy Haynes, this is so funny to me that I see this in here. So, like he had at the time I before I say anything, like literally love all his content, watch all his videos, has helped us a ton. Right now, our CMO is in talks to join in his mastermind. Like just how all this connects is what I'm getting at is like you can learn this much or just get connected or just meet somebody in the group and that can spiral into or scale more so into tens and hundreds of millions of dollars depending right so Jeremy I bought his like social media stuff was learning how to run ads I had his contract back in the day he had like megalodon or something and like just that alone was like oh this is a framework that people scale to a million dollars a month and that wasn't even his like coined phrase then but just hilarious that like I would of course I pay all these guys and pay for all of what they've learned to jump the line. Okay, Hack Reactor, then Lay Wagon. So, this is just kind of like a little funny offshoot. Then I was like, "Oh, I'm more technical than anything, less marketing, which is still true today, but I just harnessed it more into the marketing world." So, Lelay Wagon was an online um I'm sorry, an in-person coding boot camp, and they had them all over the world. And I was like, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm going to go into, you know, coding or uh investment banking or all like I was just where my interests were. I bought it. I learned a lot of the stuff. I did not implement in level of like oh let's scale like just lean full into this and that's on me for again not having a full-on e-commerce business or a full ad agency or anything not on the course but the things I learned and the little pieces I learned are then valuable today. Okay. So I ended up going to this it was in Bali. I lived there for like two or three months and lived in this place. And this is funny later because this is where I ended up meeting Luke and Nikki in person um who are the co-founders and creators of uh the company that we're running now that I'm now coowner of. Um, so it was down the street from where they ended up being when I met them in person for the first time. Just funny. So I did a whole boot uh coding boot camp, learned all that kind of stuff. This is the big one. Consulting.com. I bought Ovens's program. I if no one knows now, but he's the school.com. He like is the OG of the new age of online marketing um for coaches and consultants specific. People have their opinions. I don't care. Um, I bought his entry program, so like the accelerator, and then just bought the up level, which was at the time learning how to make a course, basically productize your service. So, his first offering was all about how to get clients consistently. The second offering was about how to uh productize a service. So, basically make group coaching, courses, all that kind of stuff. And then the third offering was how to like be the absolute master of your specific niche in business. And it was just a mastermind, right? I'm pretty sure those were three levels. So, I joined into this. And in that group, I like pretty instantly knew I didn't want to be the face of something and I didn't even have like the wherewithal and like in the brain to be like, "Oh, I could build this around someone else." And the co-founder of Warrior Babe, who I didn't even know at the time. So, he literally put a message in that group about something completely random. I was like, "Oh, I kind of recognize that name." Clicked through to his profile. He had just posted that he was looking to bring someone on to teach him marketing and sales and all this kind of stuff. I literally like applied or booked a call more so on this thing. talk to him and next thing you know uh I'm building random sales pages and just like learning technical stuff doing all the random things and making a thousand bucks every like six weeks and like fast forward to today and I'm now that was six years ago I think in a month. Yeah, six years ago in a month from when we had our like initial call and since then we've done 70 million in cash collected together. I've now become co-owner of the company. We're like you know thicker than thieves all the things because I met him in one of these courses. So like cool. I could have spent 500 grand on these and still had an insane ROI on courses overall, let alone this specific one that cost me like five grand, right? So it's just like that's the idea here is like this is the model we ran. Then once we did that, these are kind of in order but like close to Becker was selling this at the time. So he had like this YouTube and VSSL info product training that really was a Trojan horse for Hyros. But we joined in this. I took the VSSL framework that we used to do our first one to five million in cash collected, maybe even higher, and I took literally the VSSL template that was out of here, restructured it, built it, then uh the other co-founders wrote in basically like other pieces. I just built the entire framework out, went live with it, bought sales process.io, which is Nick Cosman, which is its own story, and he literally built and like showed entirely how to do the CRM for a callunnel. So we were on close.com and how to do the deal stages and like we had no idea. I had no idea. So we paid like six grand for this, five grand for this, six grand and like by the end of this this was our entire core business model that we then scaled to a million a month and three million a month and beyond was just from buying these and like combining them together. So if I say like bottleneck and interest mapping like we didn't know how to scale a VSSL funnel. We didn't know how to structure the tech behind a VSSL funnel. Like we just bought our way through it. Okay. Um, there's a bunch of these in here that are like just hilarious to me when I look back at because I'm like, "Oh, we use that." And I built a vegan blog for my mom and the thing scaled to whatever, four or five grand a month and she was just making four or five grand a month making vegan recipes and like through affiliate lab and just like where my interest lies. It like feeds the soul, right? You can get stuck in like monotonous day-to-day scaling the same thing, but like you're like, "Oh, cool. Like today I want to go and do, you know, a peak performance program or go into e-commerce or like learn about coding." And it's like do it. Who cares? Like there's a there's a fine line for sure between like distraction and interests and just like feeding into that. So don't let it just take over and don't stop what you're doing because it's hard and because it, you know, I don't know if it's going to work and like start a side business like that's different than what I'm saying here where it's interest, it's learning, it's growing, it's meeting people, it's doing all those things inside there. Netcommerce is a funny one. I bought uh Lucanet's course netscommerce because I was like all right, maybe I'll just do e-commerce. all these different waves and places in the in the company are like, "Oh, we're at this great point." One of the two really where it's like the side business stuff. It's like it's at such a great point that we work like, you know, way less hours a week. It's still like just printing cash. Maybe we should look at all these other fun things that are in interest as like a secondary business after this one. Um or it's, you know, things are all the way at freaking zero and it's like what are cash flow games and like I don't like that mentality. We've definitely had it and I've like corrected myself from having it. Um but yeah, that's an interesting piece. So, this next commerce thing, bought this course, learned about uh he basically just did a screen record about how he was doing insane numbers on e-commerce, uh like physical e-commerce. He then posts that he's looking for a WordPress developer for something. I'm not a WordPress developer. I swipe up on it. We go back and forth. He needs a site by end of next week. I do it that same night, cancel the date, or I'm actually on a date and then and just like cancel the evening part of the date and then go back, build this thing until 3 in the morning and deliver it the next day. that turns into me running Netscommerce, Nets trades back in the day, the tech stack behind it, the Discord, the connections with all this stuff and becoming friends with Luke Nets, just in that community, hearing before he even bought Pudgy Penguins. And then knowing, hey, scoop a couple of these, you know, those like as an example again of just like who you meet and just following interest of like, oh, I was interested in e-commerce. Oh, I'm interested. These people are cool. Oh, yeah. How can I provide value and work with them? Okay, I do. So then I hear about these things and like I'm an idiot and I could have been in that like I was in all these courses when people were doing 300 X's on meme coins. Didn't even like look at it. Didn't even know what that meant and I was running the actual tech and like the structure behind things. So it's just like it's funny but oops. Nothing held back. This is huge in copywriting and like offer design creation. I have a bunch of close people I've met in here. I paid for their program when it first dropped and just like the value in there is insane. And it also taught me that like I need to have people on the team who are like this, but like my brain doesn't fully work like this. I'm not great in copywriting, marketing, all that kind of things. Closers.io. This is we got to a point where we needed the sales team was getting out of hand and we were operating it, running it, onboarding them, managing it, doing all the things. So, this was an attempt at getting basically like an outsourced sales manager, which ended up not working. And one of the key things that they like said to us basically was like, you're at the size where you need like not an agency or somebody to do it. you need someone in-house which led us down the path of finding a sales manager. Crushed on that. Started to get into some of these pieces which is like you know interested in some of the PE stuff. I have friends that are in finance. I always think it's cool and like math and left brainy so I just lean into that. Um some more affiliate and lead genen stuff which led me into this. I end up going to some conference for affiliate marketing and lead genen. It's like a zero to 10k style or like zero to 100k is actually I think was their model. Um, I end up at that thing in San Diego, hang out with some guys in the lobby bar. Next thing you know, I'm at a club at somebody's table. Person whose table it is ends up selling a course later in life and I'm like connected with them. And then other people that, you know, not to be named, but like are crushing it in lead genen in in that space. I end up moving to Puerto Rico. I meet more people that are in lead genen affiliate space that are now some of my like closest friends. I run tech behind those still and have helped with those behind it. I've scaled offers that they already have going. Again, never done anything from scratch. No ego. Not saying I have, but like I have scaled their offers that exist or ran ran ads of their offers that exist and done tech behind it. So like I understand that space now because I've been in there ad outreach. We bought these guys, Alec, great dude. Um we've bought his stuff for organic and for paid on times on terms of YouTube and scaled up a big portion of things on YouTube at the time. It was a blocker. And like you'll see a ton of these things in here all the way down to AFL most recent one or not even most recent one which is funny but I just don't want to add the other one that we just bought. But uh AFL I just personally bought like followed Iman stuff since he had like I can't even I don't even know how little like 10 I don't even know sub 5K sub 10K like very small um like still operating and trying to scale up an agency small and follow his stuff forever. talks about personal brand. Big standout to me was, "Okay, cool. I have this whole like, you know, whatever level of skills times zero in visibility equals zero in, you know, results, zero in impact, whatever you want to call it." So, AFL was the kick in the ass for me to be like, "Okay, cool. Just start making YouTube videos every day." He teaches how to do this a much better way with better everything, uh, and structurally for the team and offer. And he's obviously like a smart dude. Um, but for me it just was like kick in the ass, be around other cool people in network um, that are all attempting to do the same thing, learn a bunch of stuff, and the real kick in the ass was like record some videos. Maybe they're not as polished and nice and whatever, and that's on purpose because I don't want that audience. That's not who I'm targeting. And yeah, so that and then yeah, I'm just going to go into this, but we just bought some other stuff that's like hilarious and interesting to me. But yesterday's stats, it did 620 in leads, 135 apps, 71 calls booked. We're scaling this down. If you have seen the videos on days prior, so we're scaling this down a bit to keep it tighter and be in the more purchase optimization pockets on Meta. We had five high ticket buyers, which is okay in the right direction, but like not good. Um, oops, I didn't update that. Low ticket buyers, 46. Cash collected was actually I didn't update this, my bad. was actually 53,599. That was from two days ago that I copied this over. Um, so yeah, so I do these videos every single day. I share these. I'm sure this is kind of exhaustive. It's just to show that like how you approach something and the reasoning behind it can be like just completely different, right? Like you can you don't have to listen to everyone who says, oh, like 99% of gurus are not legit. And I will agree with that. But the 1% that are, you can't let that distract you from the 1% of people who have extreme value, who have done it, who have the result. You're going to meet people in the group. There are people there, there's gurus that are not good that you're going to get in a group with somebody else who's trying to be like you and become close with and then scale something later. It's like you have to look at the pros in all these. Um, obviously weigh that in terms of ROI. It's like you want to try and pick the best ones where you're going to put in a,000 bucks and get out 10K directly and then you can make millions extra like, you know, indirectly. But yeah, that was just kind of the gist of today's video. So hopefully this was a bit valuable and offered a little bit of color to kind of the background. Um, any questions always Instagram is the best for communication. Comment below, share, do all the things to increase the YouTube algo so we can get this up to thousand couple thousand people that are in the high ticket info space, online scaling space as that is the goal. So talk soon.
