# We Roasted These Funnels… Brutal but Effective (w/ Josh Gavin) | EP110
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sFJAB10SBE

What's up, guys? We are back. Day 110 in a row and we've got Josh Low Ticket Gavin according to his name on here. Josh Low Ticket Gavin. Legal name. Legal name. That's true. Uh, so we are going to do funnel reviews today. We posted on X uh to get some feedback or to get some form submissions. So Josh is essentially going to MC lead it and go through Sharon screen and then we're just going to bounce back and forth and go through them. So Josh, kick it off. Or actually, who are you people for the new news? Oh, I'm a I'm a 23-y old kid living in Minnesota. I build low ticket offers. I built um we're approaching 550 low ticket offers I've architected or worked on myself. And yeah, I just love low ticket. I don't I believe in high ticket. Low ticket is a means to attract high ticket, so don't confuse me with those people who say you can be profitful just low ticket. Um and yeah, we're going to jump into this and give some people some advice. Lots of low ticket in here. So, it's my favorite. It's my favorite. Let's do this. Who ready? So, first one on the table, we have it looks like an agency bisop and I asked them for as much data as possible and not everyone gave a ton of data. So, if you ever submit your funnel in a future episode, make sure to give us as much as possible. But what I know so far, Ryan, is they said, I believe, so I believe the front-end sales uh are $25 to $30. CPA, I'm going to in a second. Okay. In a second. So, we got CPA around 30 to 25 to $30. Order bumps are at a 5% take rate. That's super low. I think he means his upsells, too. So, I think the biggest thing we need to help him right with is going to be his upsells. So, let me pull these up here. I'll share my screen. So, we got an upsell issue. Usually, the problem I see upsell is they're just it doesn't make usually aren't making it clear on why this makes sense on top of what they already purchased. But Ryan, can you see my screen? All right. Yeah. This is a $25 CPA for a $3 front end, right? Yeah, it looks like. Yeah. Let's see how much the ebook is. Go to step two. That page is hurting my soul a little bit. Dude, this is bad. Uh, but hey, it's again. And when we say anything, I was going to say when we say anything on this, it's not Oh, that's interesting. Pre-check and nine after it was a three. Um, before Yeah, before we say anything, this is this is all constructive. Like obviously people are trying to get feedback. We're not like [ __ ] on anybody at all. Like anybody who's trying and doing this is, you know, 9,000 steps in the right direction. So um but all right. So what data do you have? A $25 CPA. Yep. And you have AOV. Uh no, he did not use AOV. And uh Otto's could use Titaning. And that's all he said. So got it. We're just going to rip it. But he said we know there's a 5% take credit on order bumps. And so I'm assuming he means these and he might be meaning his upsells too. So either way we know that the upsells and order bumps are not hitting. Um first thing I'll say here I only talk we'll talk about the sales page in a second but just on here like Ryan look at this seven figure soup to nuts recipe. What do you think that is without reading this? Like the seven figure soup. I have no idea. I I have no idea this for agency. The agency box book is what people are doing. And they have a seven figureure soup to nuts. So it's basically how to take your agency to seven figures if I think about it for two minutes straight. But like off the rip, it's not copy is not on. That builds an agency that runs without you is different. You can that could be a whole different like something that builds or runs on its own is a machine which is much different than a seven figure type of offering. So, if you're trying to get to seven figures, that's like a scaling how to go from, you know, if these guys are what who's the who's the ICP? Is it someone who already has an agency? Uh, it looks like somebody for agency owners and freelancers. Yeah. So, existing phoneless meetingless agency that creates halftime lifetime. Less laptop, more beach approach. God, it sounds like my worst nightmare, but some people love that [ __ ] Um, you ever had a laptop on a beach, by the way? Dude, it's the worst. I can't do I can't I can't see my screen. Mac has that new like uh whatever non- glossy laptop screen and I refuse to get it on anything because I'm like no no no sunlight. I'm either in the cave. It's hot. It's annoying. I don't I want to I want to be relaxed about it. Be totally working. People are going to watch this and be like, "What the they talking about?" All right. All right. So, from from the get sales page needs some love. Your spacing's all over the place. This This looks like GHL build, which is I cannot stand Ghell's uh default font. It just irks me. But we see here, we don't know what it like this kind of sells the outcome. Like this the phone list. Like I love like the outcome you're selling could be really good. I know this will hit. It's obviously selling. Agencies hate doing fulfillment. They hate uh they hate selling meetings. Yeah. They hate phone calls. They hate having a calendar full of meetings to do demos and do they hate the whole business model. They want to get out of it. Everyone would hate the agency. I bought everything. Yeah, dude. I think so. If you look at Jeff, we did this offer for Jeff Miller called agency behind the scenes. Uh oh, find the old page. Yeah. So, we did his we did this offer. Let's see if it worked. Let's see. Um sometimes my Wi-Fi just like blocks certain funnel sites. So, we'll see. Okay. So, let's look at a better example of a an offer that did over I think we got him to 100,000 a month on MR for his school group. Okay, so I built this funnel super ugly, really basic, but it's still ripping. So, we look at what's a good example. Uh, this is like pretty much summing up everything you're trying to say, just a better headline. So, we're implying that fulfillment is simple, right? Fulfill in 30 minutes. We're saying it's high profit and then we are saying that it's volume. So your thing is trying to say a lot of different things just not clear. And so uh we also I think you seems pretty close like happy clients seems like you kind of modeled this already. Well having happy AF clients that's something Jeff just says and so I pulled that that pay you longer than the month because you actually get them results. I like that. So this one ripped and uh again and then here we're going to what is it actually like your page I don't know like obviously the VSL can probably say stuff also like the overlay you picked seems very interesting like I don't know how it really connects or pulls me in. Yeah, YouTube video is not a vibe either. Oh gosh, a bass boost in my ears. So he said more beach less laptops. Um you should sell drop servicing at that point if that's true. But anyways, you need to fix that. You need more clarity. What is this? Who is this for? We talked about this in the last episode, but at the top of the page, right away, who is it for? What outcome is going to get them? What's the narrative of it? You're not hitting it there. Um, and then I love how many testimonials are. It does add a lot of social proof, and this is why you're probably converting like very high solution, state, warm people. But if you were trying to scale this, you're de like I know this funnel is going to hit a ceiling because it's not converting to people who aren't automatic buyers. Like, you're converting to people that Yeah, that whole thing like if you scroll up a little bit more. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Um, no, do it. No, like just like everyone's on mobile those. No one can even read those and like you're choosing and then you're doing different like like I'm such a sucker for like consistency around stuff like this and like you're the wording you're choosing to use as like the highlight you're doing in like this lower case on some you're doing like this uppercase. And like I get if you're trying to copy direct, but like people can't even read those. The margin that's both on left and right side as well as between is like crazy. Like no one's reading those. Someone's scrolling through that page as fast as possible until they get to the break where this and then they're trying to and then they're reading this because this is like more correct. You're using red on there. Another stupid example, but like you know these are the things on what's inside. Red is a no no generally if it's not in your brand stuff. And like that then is like all designed differently. I think just with a cleaner design, you're going to double. Yeah. Yeah. Like literally just I mean you're trying I see you're trying to pull a mixture of Allen's automatic clients page plus your own. I would just stick to the structure. Um this one I call it the mini AC funnel. The first one I I I was lazy. It was funny. Allan was talking about this on his call. He's like, "Yeah, people start doing mini AC cuz they're lazy to build long one." I'm like, "Yeah, it's 100% why I did it and it rips." And so I did the mini AC for for Jeff and it'll work in your market, too. doesn't work in some, but you might as well just like model the structure. If you're already trying to do it, like if you're going to try to follow a template, you might as well follow this. And this is like this is an ugly version of our pages and it's did fine. So, you can design this very simple and this one ripped, you know, 100,000 months and it's just very clear and nothing fancy. So, it's shorter than your page. You'll be able to build it. you just, you know, hire a designer to make you a a legit old way, new way thing or just get a Canva template that's in the free nothing held back group and you should should be good there. Um, your buttons are different colors like what you know it's blue now it was green before. Yeah, exactly. I think consistencies I hate I hate this little thing. I know people crush with it though so like all the power to you but like consistency I'm just talking design honestly right now but it's like consistency and that and then you're you're really good at this. So, like how would you how do you have your checkboxes? Like they have like what Blake was talking about where they have the mult multi- option which I which does is shown to like to work. I think that one's a little confusing because it's like all the same. Like for us, for example, we have one we have a two check on ours and it's like discount applied. It's like the two product discount applied. It's just two options. It's like you're either going to get the one main thing or you're going to get the other one with the discount applied. That is the order bump um separate because right now you essentially have You have what? Eight eight different AOVs you could have or I mean that's multiplication on there. So it's actually four because they could have this one and this one and this one. But like that's just kind of crazy behavior. And then same thing with what Josh said is like seven figure soup to nuts. Like no like one of these is like how to scale this how to scale it to seven figures which again is the next kind of step I believe in the current state you're just trying to make it so they can run the business model that's like light. And then the next thing right here is you're already introducing how to scale that business model from likely a couple clients to, you know, over 100k a month or 83k a month or whatever. The next one. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. It's freaking client quick makes sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. So, it's like, see, and this is for order bumps. Everyone watching this, the reason I'm able to get like a 40 to 50% take rate on all my bumps is because we sell tools or milestones. Like templates and tools are your best friend. Um, and if your front end's education, it's like a course, a workshop, a book, your the up rest of the upsells, like especially if it's bisop or B2B, give them tools to speed up the outcome on the front end. So things like this, obviously I wouldn't just say client wins. There's more you need to add into this, but uh it definitely is way better out of all of these. Like if I had to pick this one, swipe files do well. This one would, you know, probably are too high take rate if I had to guess. And then this one I would just delete alto together. Um, Ryan, answer your question about what I would do here. I've actually never have done uh like check things like this. I usually make it like if I'm doing an audio book, I just have a separate bump for that there and I always just have it be one product because I just don't want them to like I feel like they just overthink here and I know it works well. And if anything, I would just do the book and then the book plus audiobook option just so I don't have to make a whole another bump for it. But ideally on the order form, my goal is like the least amount of friction. And I want them to quick quick buy. Like don't second guess. Don't overthink. And this is just too much like thinking going on before they they get down here. So I would definitely fix that. You're nuking your conversion rate. And the whole point of order bumps is that it doesn't hurt your uh I'm sorry, your convert did I say that your conversion rate um yep is just getting nuked because people have to scroll through all that because they're trying to check it. They're trying to understand what the difference is. It's like not clean at all. H Okay. Um what do we got here? It's here's the thing like offers like this bro like they sometimes make a lot of money like they can rip like ugly funnels they can rip. So especially in these markets ugly funnels too is one thing but but the thing is like it depends on the market. The reason like this is getting by and getting sales because it's like one to 100 it's biz up. It's like you're not going to get away. So people watching this like if you have if you're not in those markets you're going to need something a little nicer. So, don't think I'm giving you the green light to to do this. But for him, he has an excuse. Like, he can get away with this. Um, okay. I take this out. Take these out. Mobile. These just suck. If you don't have a guy who can design something where it shows like one little thing here, one little thing here, one little thing here that don't just use the default elements to do this. It's just because mobile it looks super bad. But on desktop, it looks really nice. like it it goes across the top of the page like this. So try to hire someone in Canva that can make a smaller version of this or like screenshot it, make it small and then put it here or just like don't have it. Um welcome. You didn't affirm the purchase at all. Uh you didn't like say, "Hey, you just got everything you need. Here's like you didn't explain why they need this next." So you said, "Great. Gotcha." And you bait and switched them and said, "Special offer. here's everything you need. So, you're like, "Wait, I didn't get everything I needed on the front end, you scammer." Right? That's like these people think. They're like, "You freaking like you you just stole my money." And then that's why you get refunds and why you get people in the ads being like, "What are the upsells?" Or, "What are you trying to sell me later?" You got to you got to you got to affirm it. So, go back and watch our other episode. We talked about this before. Uh how I used anytime. Keep scrolling on there. opening with anyone any time. What does that even mean? Start layback sales conversations. So, you should have framed time. You should have frame this as a just client getting scripts. Honestly, like that's a if you're doing agency, everyone watching this, I've done so many agency offers uh like SEO agency, AI agency. Like I did a couple really good agency offers and all a sudden all the agency dudes want me to make like compete against my other funnels. So, it's very simple. You teach them a new agency model in the front end. Upsell one then is templates to get clients. Upsell two is fulfillment related templates. And that's it. And then order bumps are swipe files, examples, and case studies. Do that funnel, you'll rip it every time. A winning offer I did when I was a kid that I wish I would have kept going was called five meetings a week challenge. Very clear where the goal is get five meetings a week, close at 20% and get one client, one client a week. I'm going to show you how to do it. They come into the course, very clear outcome and the same upsell templates and then fulfillment. So, still waiting for someone to do that offer. I keep throwing it out there and no one wants to do it. Another one is inbound agency clients. That's another one that was really good. I've got a whole bunch. So, dude, just like make this upsell focused on just getting clients and make that very clear. And then also, I thought we already got this in the order bump. So, we're back to the soup. Back to the soup. Uh, yeah. So, I would just redo again. Follow a structure like literally go through at the top. Does it group those? Um, it's breaking down all the courses. No, it doesn't. Saying to you, you get more and then it's like you there's course one, there's course two, there's course three, there's course four, there's course five. And if they make it to the end on that page, it's like add a butthole. And also again, yes, ugly things can work. Like we talk about this on here all the time, but like you could have the ugliest page of all time and have your address at the bottom and nothing else functions on p on the page and people will mail you to buy stuff if it's like a good enough offer. But I don't think the offer makes sense even. I don't think it's even like like structured in a way. So it's a 101 in courses, 804 in savings. That doesn't make Yeah. It's like it's design and copy on this like in a nice So and we don't have the data because I don't know your AOV. You said it's like we just know his order bumps are 5%. Which like even if he means to check that's really low. That should be like 50. So step two customize. Step three customize. That isn't like even more beach laptop and even more beach. More beach and more less less laptop. Even more dude you get a beach. You get a beach. Double the beaches. Upsell one is how first how to get the beach lifestyle. Upsell two is how to get two two beaches for one. It's like supplements. You sell more beaches. I'm not even going to read like I don't even know, dude. What is the headline on this? How to turn that and then scroll the bottom. The world wait there. We go wait. The world famous five minute Loom videos that sell. So this is acquisition. So this is this is teaching them without Yes. Because the first thing they need to understand is how to get more clients. And I don't know if you're framing with your mechanism of e or I mean a mechanism or like USP is even more beach and less laptop the mechanism on this being loom videos that if anything you kind of want that to be more USP as well because it's just a loom video and everyone's like oh a five minute Loom video. Yeah. You're selling the template. you're selling. Here's the easy cookie cutter way to have like no whatever, no time like any of the stuff acquisition, which is the looms. Yeah. Yeah. I want to try to pull this up. But yeah, so that I would change that. Let me try to find an example here quick. So like I know people are like, "Well, give me an example. What does it look like? Josh and Ryan, you're out here like telling me it's all bad. Give me example." Let me try to find an example my swipe file here and then we'll jump into the next one because we got some more I want to get through. Um I have a hard stop but I already told you that but just FYI. So we got to get hard stops nowadays. I'm trying to protect my time. Got to get that assistant bro. I know I do. Got to get that assistant. Okay. Here's my swipe. I'm going to show you some mock page. Um I luckily fun hack. Duplicate your funnel. So, like if you share with people, they don't actually have your legit link. So, um hopefully a lot of you guys do that here, but just like an outline of a page. I would just switch it to a page like this where it says, and can you see my screen, Ryan? Is that good? Yep. I got you now. Yep. Important. So, it's up here. Do not close. 100% secure. So, it's all secure. Don't worry, it's all good. Watch this welcome message below. So, we say welcome. Please watch this video. And the spacing is whack right now because my desktop has a weird setting. I have a weird extension. That's freaking it up. Um, but watch this video. You'll learn how to get the most out of the program and then please watch this video. Your steps unlock a gated VSSL. So the CTA button appears after these 8 minutes here and then they can purchase or not. So, if anything, if you want to save yourself in design, everyone watching this, just do a gated VSSL upsell like this. And then below when it pops up, it's I I'm not going to wait 8 minutes here, but it's legit just a freaking like mockup with a button and like a guarantee badge and that's it. And it it crushes. We have a we have an upsell like this, literally the same page, selling a 997 done for you offer, and we're converting 10% on cold traffic. So, yeah. Um, just steal that page. What's the ticket on this? What's the ticket on this one? That one was just a 197 and then there's still having the consumption of that for that and then also everything that happens in emails and all that. We're not going to go into that because we just only have pages but like Yes, sir. those crank and like even that page has some love it could have right like No, seriously. Right. Like clickable uh whatever like thumbnail on there uh all that kind of stuff. Huge. And then so for you Yeah, I would do that on there. I would do some version of that and then I would also make sure that you frame the first upsell like Josh was talking about like what is the first thing that happens not a course bundle of seven different things and then the next one being more of the same framing it as like the loom you know the templates here's your templates now on how to get clients like today right is like you know so I think they probably understand I'll shut up now let's do it all right next one I think this is an uh health vertical Let's see. Okay, so X1 is here. Oh, there we go. Yep. Sales for cost. So, it's very new. It looks like they just started these ads. Okay, so all that matters for us right now is cost per results 45 bucks. And of course, we have no AOV. I think we need to change how we're adding. We're going to add in this stuff. We'll make it better. There'll be a link below for you guys have a better one. We started running ads on June 26. I plan on making the copy stronger for ads or find a sales copy and add an order bump in Otto to increase AOV. For now, we wanted to launch quickly and uh test instead of trying to perfect everything. Focus to get customers quick result from the front uh book and consultation uh to sign up for coaching. I'm already going to push back on doing a book, but I I'll say h it's whatever. All right, let's see what this is. All right, so this is the one that's $45 CPA. It's such small data. Bro, what the freak? Your page is SC. It doesn't have an S. My Wi-Fi doesn't pull up pages. It don't have a nice little I think it's a secure thing. Let me see here. SSL. Mine definitely won't. Mine won't even open some of your pages. Go here. If you want to pause, I can try to pull connect to different Wi-Fi. We can try to pull it up. Not pausing the next one. Let's see. Let's see if anyone else has a legit. Okay. Okay. Here we go. So, we got another one here. All right. So, so we got pixel set up. So, it's book a call funnel. Cost per lead is cost per lead. Book a call button click is $30 and it has no bookings. All right, let's look at it. You want this average play like 15 10% conversion link click to VSL play. All right, let's check this out. Click Funnels 2.0 page. Do you want mobile view? Yeah, 95% of most people's traffic. Yeah, I'm already I'll let you. You're a big VS. You're a Vs. I mean, you literally you're offer you're on you guys use VSSL. DTA what I always talk about is a DTA funnel. Crush these is how they run. So, um it's going to be headline VSSL. watch this thing and then schedule your call, book a call, apply, whatever. Okay, so if you scroll through that page, what happens when you learn elite mentorship career progression? So it's a closing biz up on how to become a remote closer. Yeah. And then book a call is embedded on page as well. And then what happens if you like can you click on that or go? I think it's probably going to do the same thing. Go to Why is it right clicking? there. Okay. It goes down. Oh, just it's just CJ. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Um All right. So, you click on that. What are the application questions? Let's go book a call. Okay. He's got available time today, which is good. Speed. Why is it not working? Here we go. Let me try to I might have to change it to desktop. That's fine. Oops. We're both like I mean some at some level it's fine. No one's going on. So very very limited. Wait. Okay. Calendarly has been bugging a little bit. All right. Uh how would you describe? I'm currently working high ticket sales. Monthly earnings. Where are you at now? Where do you want to be? And then this is just classic. I have little savings. I have some savings. Can you pay me? These questions are so like clear. It's like I'm going to sell you something. I want to make sure you have this much money to be here. Yeah, dude. I know. It's like whatever. It still works, I think. I don't know. I don't run up at all. I I've actually like direct. You usually ask like their age. You ask how much they have saved? That's fine. Do they have an existing business? When did they get into business? Are they working a job? You ask like indirect. And then you come up with like and you maybe ask if you show like if it does make sense would you be able to uh invest. That's usually how we dance around it in bisop instead of directly asking because there's like there's a lot of shame involved if you're like have to click this one or like this one because people compare and they know it's not like a ton. So you gota you got to feel it out. So what are your thoughts? VSL man call phone starting up on the top. Yeah. Video reveals how sales professionals are transitioning to remote sales and earning 10 to 30K. How sales professionals are transitioning to remote sales. So, you're targeting people who are in sales in their career, but you want to teach them how to go remote without needing to cold call or quit your job immediately. Okay. I mean, that's not terrible. I mean, I think it needs to be I don't know how you're targeting or what your what your ads are bringing them to. Can you look at that data really quick? Because I think he said it was like a $2. I mean, not like it's like I think he was the one that had 3% CTR. Yeah, he had a 2% CTR click, too. Total link clicks. You've only had 93 people go to page. A good number for this is five or 10%. I know we were on I was Jeremy and he was talking 20 30% click to app, which ising crazy, but like if you're not getting like five or 10, then something is definitely broken. Yes. And you're running one ad. Not saying that's a problem, but what what are your thoughts in the ad? And sales earning four to six per month. You know, there's another level that's got to get flagged to by the new financial update like calling out specific things that's definitely going to be put in a special category soon. I also don't think that if you're in sales earning four to seven is really makes sense. Why? Like what if someone's making eight or three or 50? Also, it's like that makes like a lot of people. Yeah, completely. Lots of people target. Yeah. Uh without starting over, make the transition from the remote sales model where I can earn more. Yeah. Lean into that part. Earn more, work less, and live on my own terms. So, because really what the whole thing of remote is is like it's the ease of being able to do the job. It's the people who go and drive around and have to go to physical locations and do all this stuff like spend their entire day driving just to make have a conversation and sell or do doortodoor or whatever. Like so you're kind of also being a little broad but like not saying that's a problem but like if you're in sales and then you're tightening in the targeting to 4 to 7,000 per month people sales is massive. So, like taking someone from I don't know what your experience is, but like your experience being able to sell that. You went from door to door to remote, sell door to door to remote. If you went uh medical sales to remote, do medical sales to remote. Like be able to do that. Corporate sales. Yeah. So, he's like, he's talking about commutes and corporate and whatever. So, like layer that in somewhere. You need to like I mean most people are just going to use this and thousands commission. I kept trying to read that from here. You're good. Is that better for your eyes? I'm just like I've got like three windows open and like that's where it's at. All right. It's not I mean whatever ad you are kind of doing more more call outs but then so go back to squeeze page. Yeah. Also change that name up there but that's a little thing. Yeah. And then how to get into high ticket which now you just introduced high ticket. they don't know what that is or care because you're you're talking about true like you know what I mean like high ticket sales we know but like they're in corporate and you're teaching them remote sales and now you're talking about high ticket sales. Yeah. Also all know like meansish the same thing but they don't know that the difference between someone making 5,000 a month and 20,000 per month. So now you're talking all about income differences. Okay. So he worked with Charlie. Here's the thing. One thing I have an issue with the messaging from the offer side is and this is a big issue like a lot of people who do closing like I knew guys doing a closing setting bizop they were doing a million a month with a low tia funnel uh just like on that and what happened is they maxed out the TAM and like people are so aware of the mechanism of remote sales where there wasn't much novelty to it if you go on YouTube look at remote sales there's like a hundred influencers talking about it so you need to understand you're not in the romantic stage anymore you're in the realism and accountability stage. And so you're competing on uh results now. You're competing on you have to go that's why I see some people go to done for you uh where they they flip the upsell path done for you on the front because people are like already bought education. It didn't work. And so for you, you either need to have some sort of novelty like what makes your remote sales different because the number of people who don't know about remote sales or haven't consumed content on it um is it's way smaller. it's a really small TAM and so they're going to be comparing you to Cole Gordon uh uh the sales agency all these are dudes who are pushing massive spend and so either like the biggest thing is you don't have a ton of testimonial or status like them is to just do something different so I've been telling remote and sales people this forever but I think people should be transitioning people out of like instead of being remote sales uh in general it should be remote sales for like a new industry so my buddy just got into tech sales for like government and he's doing great I'm like dude Instead of telling people to do remote sales for info where it's very saturated, just be like, "Hey, in know remote sales, you probably try info or want really good job stock high ticket offers, you can make more money doing the same amount of work in a new market, right?" So, same thing of red ocean, blue ocean. So, if you really want to spice this up from freaking messaging wise, if you want to pierce through even though you don't have as much status as Cole Gordon, then just have a new novelty and be like, "Here's how to transition." I just going to say it's exactly what I was going to say is like them saying six their brand name being six figure remote and saying remote sales like there's competition in that market. You are basically you're duping what he created as his like I don't want to say it was really necessarily unique to him but like he owns the remote remote sale remote whatever thing. So even just having something different as like what your mechanism style or what your USP is not remote high ticket model. So like literally as simple as like remote high income, remote high, you know what I mean? Like because like they don't know what high ticket is. They're not familiar with high ticket funnels. They're not familiar with these things because they're coming from corporate world. So being able to call out corporate and then like exactly what Josh just said, moving industries entirely to this new online world. Yeah. Like existing people. Yeah. Because it's like what are the I mean exactly. You're you're literally giving the benefits in here. I just don't think they're getting to the point where they can hear this. Yeah. If you're talking about pre-qualified leads, no cold anything. You're talking about complete remote, not having to drive around and do that grind. You're talking about higher commissions is kind of one thing, but like it's more so the throughput. I don't know if higher commissions is the thing that's more important or like your higher income because higher commissions doesn't necessarily have to be I mean it is true for this but exactly the do the math portion is what's really the more think you're you're talking in a way where only a person who's already been in like knows this model would understand. So people don't understand they're checked out. So the people understand us they already know this model which means they know your competition which means you probably consume those people's via cells which so then you just made it even harder. So it be one thing if you're talking people that no idea about this stuff but your language is attracting a person who does like they don't understand but what are we selling you know is this info what are the inbound inbound calls for like the reason Cole Gordon stuff worked well and Dan Lock dude even Dan Lock he was before Cole like Dan Lock freaking milked the market but thing they had a super structure they said they were talking about how info is so big and online education's the next wave it's a billion dollar market and how you can make money from it is people need sales reps. So get into it. So for you, you're lacking super structure for why what is what's high ticket? What are we selling? Like I need to believe that people want the product. Like right now the best thing I would do like or best if I a best sales remote bisop is teaching people how to sell for AI software companies like going because AI is big. It's like AI is so much money is going into it. Everyone's AI and you know AI companies are hiring sales reps to sell their corporate or enterprise packages. has higher margins. It's an easy product to sell because everyone wants it. And I would teach them how to get into that. And so then AI becomes my super structure. And then all a sudden I can like knock on info and be like ah you know it's getting a little saturated or you know only a few winners like are big offer owners who can even hire you. But in AI like every day a new AI company's opening and so you can just flip it and just make it a way better offer. So yeah, I think it's a message and then double down. Yeah, I was going to say I agree. And then doubling down on that for the step two of this real quick and then we can move to the next one. But the schedule your call like schedule your call. Like you're telling them the literal thing to do which is like not Did that just reload at the top of the page? Yeah. Yeah. Step two, schedule your call. It needs to be like and then you're framing out the next thing is what you're going to learn on your free growth call. Like it needs to be like on an example that we use is like book your XYZ call to learn how to do XYZ and like you're aggressive here just throwing your notes up. Um everyone look at my notes. But no like framing the call is like what it actually is. So like you're calling it a free growth call, but then up there you're just saying like schedule your call, book call, choose a time to speak to me onetoone. Is it valuable that they want to speak to you onetoone or is it valuable that they want to get the result? What is the mechanism you're calling the result? Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, all right. We'll go to the next one. I was going to show you an example, but we kind of made the point here. I think it's a messaging issue for sure. You're going to run into a big market. You can make that market works. It works. I think it's like your goals. Like I if I'm going into that market, I'm expecting to build like a maximum $100,000 a month business with what's still available. But I'd be have to talk to people who don't know it exists. I'd have to create new customers instead of going after people who know about Cole and everyone else. That's just Yeah. Once you really unless you have more status because think like you have a few pages and then you compare it to Cole's page. Like dude, whole and his experience on there was how he did it, right? How he went from whatever he said he was stuck at four to 6K and then he took it to 23 or 36 or whatever number he said. Like yeah, that's not, you know, it's cool. People want to like work side by side someone who's done it more so sometimes than like big companies with all these huge stats, but like you're going up against those guys. So you need to like you need to own your corner until you have that and like resonate in that way for it to make sense for someone to want to work with you and someone who has 1,000 times the results. Yep. Okay. Next one. We have two options, Ryan. We have someone who just started ads and they spent $5. Or we can review someone who has actually told us their AOV and their CPA and other things too. Should we wait to review the person with F$5? You guys have resubmit probably. I don't know how much. Yeah, do your AOV and CPA. Okay, so this next one here, um, we're down to Yeah, we'll do at the end if you have time. Appreciate you submitting it. Whoever that was, we will. If anything, just resubmit for another episode. Um, do you move your wedding ring to your thumb when you work? It's It's a fidget. Like I fidget with it. My wife hates it. She's always like, "Stop." Like, "Don't move it." And I'm like, "You're gonna lose it. You're gonna lose it. You're gonna lose it." I'm like, "I I need a fidget ring, dude. I need like a spin or something. I need a secondary." Yeah. You need your wedding band and your engagement. What do they do? I don't I don't know. Yeah. Get the rubber one or whatever. All right. Okay. Offers toolkit is converting cold traffic at 4.6. Oo, it's pretty gassed. No, that's pretty good. That's pretty good for average cart 72, CPA 115. And what are they stuck with? More customers. We increase ad spend, but sales don't. Okay, so it breaks when they scale. Let's see how many ads are running. 20 new a week. Straight up, dude. There's so much AI right now. It's like not hard to have 20 leads. Austin Ford, I've heard that name. Yeah, he's uh he was at the event we were at. You probably met him. They good at challenges. Shout Austin atomic offers the secret. Wait, wait. Most experts thinks more content, but that's exactly what high ticket offers are failing. Less is actually more. I think I don't know. I don't believe simplify your offer. Streamline your delivery. Wait, so what's he selling in that first one? Most experts think more content equals more value. But that's not exa that's not that's exactly why those aren't working less is actually I don't think that argument hits like I don't think people think that's what makes like too many videos random bonuses and years of value sounds great but you're drifting out I would here's how I would reframe it like you're what you're trying to say is people think that they need to add more to their like they think it's a offer stack issue uh and they need to add more but I think more people think it's a funnel issue like in the market people already like there was they auto and offer issues. So that's why Alex from came in and like introduced, "Hey, here's how to fix your offer." But a lot of people in the high ticket space thinking it's a funnel issue. And so I don't know. I think for you like I would knock like it's not a funnel issue and then introduce like um like cuz people believe it is. So you have to tell them why that's not true and kind of have a counterargument. It's like stop obsessing over your funnel. The real issue is like what you're selling in that funnel because you're talking about offers. So you either talk about traffic, funnels, or offers. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's what I was going to say cuz like in that top one or that middle one, too many videos, random bonuses, and years of value. So I assume when you're talking about years of value in the first one, you're talking about more content, more value. You're talking about the traffic sources. And then you're also talking about the kind of like funnels, but yeah, exactly. Offers more than anything. Like I think I would bite on the fact that oh, you don't need, you know, to have six offers. You just need one offer and your offer is wrong. Like the reason that you're scaling is because your offer is broken. your and like lean into that and just run the gambit of like the reason it's not working uh is because of that. Even this I mean the meta of this is that's why this isn't like at that scale right is like the offer is or like it's not clear it's not clear enough. Um yeah, I like it dude. I mean like look at the I like the little testimonial snippets in there. Like our our client Jordan who turned a $500 workshop that he had as an offer into a $10,000 program. Like that's the type of sh like I like that. How do you reframe and re restructure your offer? Like I wouldn't talk about how like I would talk about the biggest like reason why people aren't converting on the phone is because you're you're telling them too much stuff. Like have you ever gone in like what if you went to a car dealership and they started telling about every single little feature you didn't care about? It's like you're probably there for one or three reasons like you want better gas mileage or he wants it looks good or he wants something safer reliable. Like a good sales rep knows when to shut up but you you can't shut up. your offer stack is so long like this this and this and then also then you have to fulfill for years and you're give like you're doing you're doing more work than you have to make your life easier they don't know what to buy they don't know what they what they're buying it's like every single person we've looked at their funnel stack so far is like has been that issue like this is the solve to that is like people don't your offer I'm excited to see what the upsell track is on this can you go to page I love that you please have an going back oh that up his stats. No, no, no. I said I love that you did that. Oh, here we go. So, this is what a pretty page looks like everyone from prior. Um, yeah, he's got Clickfunnels. He's got Clickfunnels mixed with the AC. He's got the fonts. Yeah, this is beautiful. So beautiful. First and last name. Kind of weird. The check the box over there on the right is kind of funky, but I'm sorry. This is design thing. Looks Is it? Yeah, I just I don't know if it's looks like Go Hollow font, but I think it's Click Falls. I can't tell. I don't know. Oh, look at that. It's like this is I think it's like I think I bet it's go high level. This I can sense it. I can feel it. Okay. Sorry, I'm scrolling through the beauty though. What the Yeah. Proven framework helping create five take and practically sell themselves without adding more complexity. Yeah. So, lean into I mean this is not as to be very blunt here. This is not as much my game. That's why I kind of like doing these because I like seeing them like I you know we run more in the callunnel game. Um but page is beautiful. the headline. I still am like depending on who's here because it's like yeah it's like are you taking somebody on how to create an offer? Are you telling some are you helping someone reframe their current stack or take something that currently exists as an offer and make it so it's that this is kind of like overarching all of those a little bit which maybe is the point but I would like I think when it says without adding more complexity drowning in content like one of my biggest issues with bullets. Yeah. So for everyone listening want to improve your conversions like easy way to boost it is get super clear on what you mean when people say like like the sales guy he said without starting over what does that mean starting over what like it's like pretty much the issue people have when they sell features and benefits and they're not selling outcomes. So you need to show them what things they're avoiding. So without adding more complexity, I would say without giving away lifetime coaching or support, without creating like add giving away eight bonuses or having to create eight bonuses for your offer, without um you know giving one-on-one support in your coaching, right? Like what do you got to be way more clear? So just adding that alone is going to help people uh spark their imagination for what it is they don't have to do. And so like without doing one-on-one Zoom calls every single week with your customers, without you know burning out delivery, what what's burning them out? It's probably calls. Like I said, the Zoom calls, it's probably support in the community, which people do give away way too much when they don't have to. And so if you look at um Funnel Gorgeous, they had a offer called a scalable coach, I think, and they did a really good job at this and explaining the pain points that burn out coaches and how their model avoids that. So I think you need to do more of that. Yeah, agreed. Agreed. Let's look at the Otto. Let's see. Did he have a link or order of them? Yeah, he ordered. He had three pages, right? Yeah. Check out Otto1. Yeah. What' you say? His AOV was $75. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's how you do that's how you do an OTO or I'm sorry, an order bump. That's how you do an order bump. Yes. Insider pass order. I don't know. The insider pass to top. Okay. It's just a swipe file. Insider pass. Yeah, I would just say it's a swipe file. And I think people in this market know what swipe file is and would literally want a swipe file. Yeah, if you maybe just say it. Yeah. So, yeah, it's pretty easy. This one again, great order bump. Swipe file is my favorite. One of my favorite things is called a a case study VSSL order bump. That's my unique mechanism name. Fire, right? And what you do is you sell a case study, so it's a swipe file of work you did for one of your private clients. And then at the end of it, you pitch them to book a call. So you hide the ascension within it. And so you're just selling a case study via cell as an order bump. And people love them and it helps with ascension inside your product. So uh anyways, little nugget for watching. Um 60. So he's probably making up I wonder his take rate is on his upsell. I don't know the upsell pages take rates, but this looks good. push your button change colors. I hate that stuff. Drives me crazy. Was it orange? Orange on the front page. Oh yeah. Simple congruence. You need the congrent. I love that stuff. And then there no check boxes on that. Like simple stuff like that. But like again if you're over 50 60 whatever what's your target? What's yours on checkout? 50 60%. Yeah. Yeah. You know 50 60. So, it's like don't don't worry about these little You can hire some sero guy later to obsess over over that stuff. Here's the big one. Is it a book a call so somebody can do it instantly over personalized for you? See, again, this is how you do it. Customize. Welcome to the toolkit. Reaffirm. Congratulations. You got your thing. Amazing. In-house seven figure one to many. Like there's a code have chat make the code that hides the stuff on your loop video. it. I know it. It's a thing. I have it somewhere, but hide that. Upload it to Wistia and pay or oralics and pay $211 or whatever the cost is. Here's why I'm giving you in-house system. Here's why I'm giving you an in-house seven figure one to many sales system. So, now you're teaching them how to sell. Uh-uh. I don't think I I mean, yeah. No, not yet. This isn't my game. I bet. And I get clearly it's working, but or a little bit, but what's the cost? 197 because now it's like we're going to have to educate them on believing in the one to many salesunnel which it already requires a lot of lift because you have to convince someone to be okay presenting. You have to convince someone to be okay um what I what I would have done. Here's what I would have done. Um let's see. So I would have literally version do go. Sorry you were breaking up but I didn't hear yours. No, go ahead. Okay. What I would have done is they now they have the offer. You're showing how to create the offer. I would simply show them how to present or pitch the offer anywhere. So instead of saying it has to be one funnel like you're doing here, you should help them with doing on sales calls, webinars, challenges in their group, pretty much just how to pitch it, how to present it depending on the funnel in a way that simplifies and like increases conversions. So instead of you selling them on a whole funnel build, I would have just done a instead and you're giving away a lot here. I know where you're trying to take people cuz he does done for you challenges on the back end. But I would just simply focus on the presentation and be like hey like you can have an amazing offer but if you don't present it if you don't describe it in a way that sparks the imagination and creates desire uh it won't work. So I'd be like creating an offer about how to create desire for the offer in your pitch. So it's like this mechanism on like desire like how to generate automatic desire instant desire uh in the pitch whether you're doing challenges because think you're including everyone now but this you excluded everyone who doesn't want to do a challenge or webinar which is a huge demographic of the market a lot of people don't like going and doing live events they're super stressful a lot of work huge lift there's so many objections you just added into this instead of making a product that includes everybody and then later you should introduce your done for you option where you just do it for them which everyone Everyone wants anyways. No one wants to run a challenge themselves. I mean, you know this Austin, like that's why they pay you. So, um, that's what I would change. Yeah. My thought is, yeah, for the next thing, what is the next thing they need? Yes. It's how do you how do you present it? How does what is the acquisition source or whatever of that or model for that? The other is you talked about content in these other places. How do you do traffic to it? You could sell into there what you're already doing, which is the sales system, but like how do you even get them to the phones? So that's kind of after the fact of these other two. And then what I think for this and where I my mentally would go is like, oh, you just got how to simplify your offer or how to make the best offer, whatever. And it's like, oh, it's right here, but how do I do that faster? And it's literally I'll pay $197 for a 30-minute implementation call or an hourong implementation call for whatever dollar value where you have a coach. It kind of messes with fulfillment a little. So I don't know what your team stack looks like. Um, but like that's what I would do. Like further implementation, same information, further implementation as an upsell. Uh, you have so many levers you can pull with this cuz it's like once you have the offer or the idea that they're then going to be able to solve for the offer. It's like you can do it faster, you can do it quicker, you can have it done for you completely for a thousand bucks. I'll get on with you and I'll do the entire offer for you with you. Yep. Um, should all be about offers then have separate funnels for challenges and everything later. But like this should all be about offers until the back end. Does he have another page on there or is this the last one? Let me click no thanks. I think his last one. Yeah. So no downell. You should have a downell. Might as well have a pop-up down even though I click no thanks. It should pop it down. Yeah, exactly. And then just be like, hey, no. Okay, fine. And you get the same thing on a payment plan, a threepay plan that equals or two pay plan that equals out to whatever 250 or 300. Yeah. Three pay plan of 97 97.97, you know. Yep. Cancel, you know, you can get a refund. You don't get the value. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a good that's a has a lot of that has a lot of legs. I love stuff like that because I I truly like and I think a lot of people in the market that you're targeting are under the belief of like offer offer offer. So, if you're someone who can solve that, dude, like that right now resonates for me because I'm like, "Oh, if we crack this low cold low ticket offer, I don't understand that. It's like if they crack that cold low ticket offer, that cold whatever offer, like nothing else matters." Like, of course, everything else matters, but like that's such the core thing. So, you're saying low ticket funnels are most important funnel to have. I'm saying uh go to what is your thing? Offer publisher low ticket offers. I was trying to I'm trying to shield for you and I don't even know your link. I don't even know your links. So, No, dude. I send so many people to you on the on both sides. So, your two things right now. Let's quick shill actually though. You have the beginner friendly, which is the people who ask a lot in the Q&A is I'm like, "Oh, go here to learn how to do the expert plus marketer business model." And then I do think that there's another leg on there for operator, but that's that's a separate conversation. And then the other is you build these out for people, low tickets, full offers for people that are already what doing 100 grand a month basically. Yeah. Yeah. Like the last three people talked to all doing a million a month. And so we do it, we have the option where it's, hey, we're either going to publish you and do a performance-based deal where we're going to work with you and grow your business. Um, and then we also have the option for a lot of people watching your content or freelancers, copyrighters, you're trying to grow your skills and you're like, you know what, I want more ownership and control. I want I don't want my client breathing down my neck saying, "No, make your order bump like this or change this." like if you want that um then we teach the path uh to build a business that way which I know your your partner Luke we interviewed on our channel he followed that similar model himself and look look at the award behind you. So there's you can definitely scale these businesses pretty far. I just put the 75 on and it's like slightly slightly tilted and it glues itself directly on the second you click it. Like I literally put a corn and it got stuck. It's a little bit jarred but it's fine. It's beautiful. It's all good. So anyways, be a completely new one where it's already stuck on. Please, thank you. All right, guys. Well, we'll do maybe do another episode. We'll make a better form. Make sure to leave your AOV. Make sure you give us all your stats. Like, we'll ask for it. Um, for the person who submitted one, we didn't get to it. Run spend more money on ads and then come to us so we can give you better feedback. But appreciate you all and thanks for watching. GG. Talk soon, guys. Bye.
