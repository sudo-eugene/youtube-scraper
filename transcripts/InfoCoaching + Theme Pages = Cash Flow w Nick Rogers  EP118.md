# Info/Coaching + Theme Pages = Cash Flow w/ Nick Rogers | EP118
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YghRdmMmNs

What's up, guys? We are on day 118 in a row. Can't believe I'm even saying that. And we've got Nick Rogers. I vetted him because you guys [ __ ] on me for not vetting people before. So, he sent me this. I feel so bad. I have to ask for like, "Hey, can you send me all your stats?" But he sent me all stats. Then I incorrectly had thought his last name was GRS, but now we're here. So, Nick, kick it off. Who are you? Oh, that happens a lot with my last name because my handle is like an abbreviation for it and people think it's the uh well, I don't want to get you demonetized here on YouTube, but they think it's the nword. Um, so anyway, yeah, I uh I guess I'll start with what I do now and then maybe work back a little bit on the story just to give you full context. So, what I do dayto-day right now is I have a theme page network on IG. We did 276 million views last month. We're already at 102 105 so far this month. Um, mostly like business niche network. So that's number one. Second, we have a I have a consulting company where we help people start their social media specifically personal brands. And then the people that kind of graduate that I kind of pick off and I take equity of them or I take rev share of them and I scale them up uh much bigger. So those are the three things I do today and they all kind of work together. Because a lot of those people that we take on as basically our own brand, our own equity, we can pump through the pages. So we can take all that traffic and and the network that is the pages and we can push that traffic towards those brands, towards those people and grow them in that manner. So it's all very very cohesive uh and work together. Now there we go. He's back. He's having fun internet issues. So we're just going to have fun in this one. You're good. You're good. So yeah. No. So, where it left off for me and I don't know and apparently I'm also exiving this which is hilarious. So, um really? Yeah. So, okay. So, explain to me the page portion of it first. I want to like understand the front front to back because I I I kind of understand what you're saying how they all kind together. But, so just the page portion. So, when I started I was trying drop shipping. I was trying I the typical you know you take a you take a product from China AliExpress you're like this this might be good. And it never was for me you was always pretty shitty. Um, but I was spending all this money on Instagram pages to promote the products. And so I kept looking at this and I'm 19 at the time and I'm like, "Oh, smart, you know, why don't I just start my own pages?" And so I started to dabble in that and I started posting business news and it just popped. It was kind of one of the first businessy theme pages. Like the motivation niche existed, but the business niche didn't really exist yet. So, if you're familiar with pages like Wealth, I knew Wealth when he had 10K followers, you know, I saw him grow from zero um or 10K, but I was I was kind of in that in that niche. And from there, I just started growing growing growing and people came to me and said, "Hey, like I want your help growing my page." And that's how the agency piece started. And I ended up instead of like I used the pages to sell some info, do some affiliate, I sold a lot of advertising on there, which is shoutouts, you know, to grow people organically and that whole thing, grow their audience. But really what I started to do was leverage them to grow clients. So I would sign clients and I would use all these followers I have and I would shout them out. So let's say we have a real estate guy. Hey, such and such did XYZ, he owns, you know, 100 million worth of real estate, blah blah blah, the whole thing. you should go follow him. We'd have a real estate guy, we'd have a trading niche, we'd have all sorts of, you know, Amazon FBA, ecom, all sorts of niches. And you're doing this all from the same page or you're doing multiple pages at this point? Uh, that was multiple at that point. And then we used to buy a lot of shoutouts, like a lot of shoutouts from from other pages. And I don't know, would you consider that paid? Would you consider that organic? How would you what would you consider that? That's how Yeah. I mean, we've never really played that game. That It's funny you say this because to one, this was my initial intro into internet marketing. I had like no idea about any of this. And I was probably I was 19. I was 18 or 19. I think I was 18. Um, no, I was 19. But uh I bought a course um that was $497 that was Instagram whatever internet money type literally. I'm pretty sure that's its name. And you were basically paying for shoutouts, sending them to link in bio. You didn't even have your own page. So, you weren't building your own asset there, but you were sending them to a page that was an opt-in and then you had the thank you page as a redirect to a ClickBank offer. So, like to try and self-quidate, build an email list and then just mail your list and then make money from affiliate offers like content content content affiliate offer content content. So, like that was how I learned about it. So, in that capacity to my understanding, like I would put that as paid, but where you're doing it to grow pages, that's like that's like a hybrid, right? because now you have the organic following. It's in your asset, not paying for it, but it's really to grow the following. Yeah. And uh I want to expand on that point actually because I think there's something interesting because you have you have a lot of guys on here that do paid. Yes. I think they all right. Pretty much like all you guys uh Yeah. Like Ahmed was on here. Uh he's the one that sticks out in my head as someone who like really leans into organic. His whole like black swan approach where all of his clients are generally speaking doing YouTube long form. And there's a couple, but like yeah, I mean I hang out with a lot of the guys who do uh paid and then all the guys in the Iman crew and whatever that I hang out with over there are almost all organic. So it's like that's kind of the dichotomy. Got it. My thought process and I've pulled from a lot of different people, you know? I've seen I've seen how a lot of the really really like advertising heavy paid guys run things and I'm like I don't know if that's me because I don't know. I look at it, I'm like, [ __ ] like the the overhead of those ads, you know, something breaks. And I see you talk about it too on on the channel sometimes. Yeah. Where it's like, [ __ ] we're kind of negative here. And I'm like, I don't know if I want to be in that position. I really like the coziness of the organic. But I I've seen, you know, I've seen the really heavy paid guys. I've seen the really heavy organic guys. I've seen a lot of the guys that do the hybrid. And the the way I've kind of expanded on it from the pages is the pages were like an unfair advantage. I had those. I use those to grow clients, to grow myself, grow grow the audience, grow the brand. And then we would start to run organic or not organic, sorry, retargeting ads that retargeted the followers with basically a CTA, aka a direct response ad that says, "Hey, buy my shit." And my process now is more more so mimicking the organic. So, if we get a a a piece of content that just bangs in the algorithm, we'll put money behind it. So it grows the audience more. And then we'll have another ad that takes that audience and nurtures them. So we'll have a lot of this middle of funnel content that just targets only the followers and it nurtures them and it makes them say, "Holy [ __ ] like I really like this guy, you know, I see I see all his stuff. He can really help me." And then the people that watch, you know, a certain percent of that will then get retargeted with the direct CTA, the the direct response ad. Um yeah, Jeremy Haynes used to have something about Uh it was called I think he called it the Venus fly trap. His is like almost all paid or at least and Jeremy don't hate me but I think it is mainly all paid but he uh he used to do it where it was basically like you're moving someone through a funnel like almost of awareness. So it would start with paid XYZ and then it's like once they saw this ad they would show them to this. So similar to what you're saying except your initial step is organic and then you move them through the funnel steps like almost forced through paid because you can target then obviously that's the other benefit of paid is like very specific targeting. Um but that's super interesting. So, you're building so you're building these pages back up and you have multiple clients, multiple niche pages. Did you ever think like I I don't know what happens with these pages. I know two guys like that are actually pretty local to me. Um, and I need to connect with those guys again because I like feel like I talk about them all the time, but like they were mobbing with this. They were creating a ton of organic pages. I think they were flipping them. They got into like handles at one point. You know, everyone in that world knows each other and they were doing these massive pages. I don't know what they ended up doing or like monetization wise, but like last I heard they're crushing it. So, like shout out them. But um do you build up the pages to want to sell them? You strictly use them as advertising and then you can swap out the offers and different clients like what's I've I've thought about the the selling part of it a lot. They are pa pages are such a headache to uh manage. [ __ ] Did I did I You're keep it reconnecting. Um, pages pages are such a headache to manage sometimes because I think every page I've ever had got banned at least once. And so, so you just have to have a rep at IG, Facebook that that just can get you and they're pretty common. So, like that's not a huge deal, but you got to pay every time. It's annoying. I have one page that's been down for like 6 months at this point, you know, 400k followers just down. Uh, you know, just stuff like that. They're always just getting banned. Um, my thought process is I would like to sell them. I think I've I've spoken to some people that do buy and sell businesses and like they exist in that world. It's not my world per se, but they they think that the strongest path to do that is to make most of the income from ads and to have a specific product that is only existing on that page, which would be basically a separate infounnel that only exists on those pages. And I have 19 20 I have 20 pages now actually. and that that's kind of like the sale aspect of things. Uh I don't think that's what I want to do necessarily right now. Lost you again. How about now? How about now? I'm right next to the router. There we go. We're back. I'm on top of the router. out. I'm I'm getting cooked by the Wi-Fi. Um I I apologize. So, you're good. You're good. Keep going. To finish answering your question, um this the sale is something that I eventually probably want to do cuz I don't envision me running theme pages forever. You know, I started at 19. I'm 26 now. I don't really touch them on a dayto-day. The team touches them. But I don't want to be 40 being like, I own a bunch of pages. You know, it's media lever. It's Yeah, exactly. I mean like if you have a team if yeah you have an asset I mean it's an asset class at some level right it's like I have this grouping of pages but I mean I guess I get the the optics of it but cuz so so what so you take them all and then the bigger thing you were saying there that I picked up on in between was the you take like consulting for equity you take consulting for revshare or you take client like service work for revshare or equity like what do those deals look like so because now you have based on what I understand so far and like sorry about a little bit of choppy so I'm trying to okay so we have the we have all the pages You also do some level of paid and then you plug into other info coaching generally clients some ecom maybe or no so no no ecom I don't touch ecom only info done a tiny bit of like software but it's kind of like almost bizoppy info a little bit that's just kind of the world I live in and I understand it and I yeah and not to go out of it I think you can probably relate to that I I don't know but I um yeah I say I'm like I'm staying in info coaching like I'm I'm good where I'm at. Like everyone tries to go pages are attractive on those. I mean, Jesus Christ. I think that within info coaching, you can go so much deeper. Oh, you're good. You're good. I think you can just go so much deeper in info coaching. I think like staying within that lane, like there's just so much cash flow. There's so much upside. Like it's not really like a private equity game where it's like, oh, I have a, you know, I have 50 equity holdings and these different things. But like the rev share agreement makes a lot of sense. Profit share agreements make a lot of sense. Scale agreements make a lot of sense. So, did I lose you again? You're good. Yes, live live stream videos are a little different. No doubt. No doubt. No, we're good. Again, dude, these are raw every single day. Law, like complete raw edit cuts, me meeting people. This is not like, oh, let's polish it and who is whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What do you think about the different monetization models? Because that's what I was trying to say and I think we cut out on it. Did we cut out again? Is maybe maybe this is like bad ju guu. Maybe I shouldn't be saying these things out loud because every time I say them, you cut out and we wait again. I hope you guys enjoy our media break sponsored by I think that's Mountain Valley Water. different monetization models. I just said this was sponsored by Mountain Valley, so hopefully they send me like 100 grand. So, um, yeah. So, monetization model wise, you said, what do you think about this for info coaching? cuz you just said equity and like I don't challenge people on here because I don't really have strong beliefs times but like equity and info coaching is so not like really a thing right like it is cool but like you have risk now you have a 0.001% 's 01% likelihood of selling. So like what's the upside versus what likely is higher as revshare or more in alignment which is profit share I guess but like I hear all the different types of them. I like revshare. I think consulting for revshare in info coaching is like like that's the hitter in my mind is not necessarily as fair depending on what kind of service delivery you have what kind of whatever. So maybe more profit share is more in alignment, but like as the person doing it, like if I was to do it tomorrow, like rev share makes sense to me because I know that I can't control the profit in the same way I can as if I'm in the operator role. So it's like that's literally it. Oh, now we're going to use this as our sponsor break by Zen. You don't think net net makes sense? You're getting so frustrated. Oh god, this is good. We're good. You're good. Roll with it. Uhhuh. Yeah. 100%. 100%. Yeah, I know a lot of those guys that do. Someone just asked in the comments, what's the difference? Cuz I literally accidentally went live on X with this. It was hilarious. So, it's actually live right now. um difference between revshare and equity and info. Revshare topline or what he's saying in there gross. So taking all the cash collected minus what you spend in ads and potentially sales team cost whatever basically to acquire it and then it's paid off that amount. Rev would be off the total top equity or net bigger issue is it's like full profit share. So, what Nick's saying is like these guys will have a marketing expense of a Lamborghini and technically the net will be like $10,000 instead of $350,000 and then you won't get paid as a proper percentage. What Yeah. No, that is absolutely ridiculous. So, what is your like client stack right now? You're doing 10 clients, you're doing 50 clients, you're doing two clients. Do you try and go big with size or is that kind of capped with what you can do in terms of organic paid with these pushes of these pages? Like, could you take one of them to five million? It's like 12 questions, but Yeah. I think high ticket start. Yeah, high ticket starts at like three to five depending in my book. Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah. I love that model. I love that model. If you're if you're good people and you have good [ __ ] I love that model. The guys who like Yeah, it's the math makes sense. The model makes sense, the cherry pick, like the, you know, cream rises, you get paid to do the whole thing, so you still get paid for your time without having to only do the cherry pick where it's only like I like the dance of having those two in one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I could talk to you I could talk to you the next 40 minutes about this. I only get to talk to I I only get to talk to a couple people about this. So my initial and like what the market initial is like terrible idea, doesn't work, won't work, a lot of wasted time, a lot of whatever, right? is like the initial and I am in the camp of like building one of those right now and in that direction that like half the time I'm like is this stupid because we sacrifice all the cash flow and all these if you're doing it in like some version of what is like the right way in terms of like how you're building the team how you're building the diversification how you're having to test things and like burn cash how you're having to machine it how you're having to remove founder comp plans W2 like depending like you start stacking all those together and your margin can go like this depending and like Then if you go out of certain scales and like you you know the contribution overhead finally you know overtakes the overhead at whatever size like I was talking a lot of videos ours is at a like a million and a half let's say and that's like technically with spending x amount on ads in order to make it so we can fill calendars so it's like not overhead but like is kind of like cost of doing business for us because we're so paid heavy so blah blah blah but like I don't know I know a guy that is doing this that's not public about it but he's doing this kind they're calling them education companies which I also have a beef with a little bit on what the difference is between info coaching and education and there is overlap but like info coaching is like the method in which you fulfill more or less education is like what you're selling kind of right and they're like a little different there and the whole thing with education is education isn't recurring unless it's structured properly to be recurring because no one pays for college for life for what they learned one time in it Right. And you hear Iman and Dan Henry had a good video about this where they talked about it. But like I know a guy who's basically grouping these together. And I think I lost you on this, but I'm just going to yap because we'll upload this after. But I know a guy who is trying to group these together. He's trying to find 5, 10, 15 of these exactly like what you said. Group them into a holding co. Cash flow the [ __ ] out of them. And then like literally he's trying to do like a take it public in like a foreign Oh my goodness. We are solo, ladies and gentlemen. This is a rough one. I apologize. I'm just going to talk about it. But I know somebody who is essentially doing that, trying to take it public in XYZ market and then trying to move it over to like the New York like just crazy talk. Something that like I'm not even familiar with. But the economics on it just don't fully make sense to me. Um because again, most of the time you have these I just yapped the whole time. So you're good. The general gist of it was I know somebody who's trying to do this, who's trying to pair a bunch of them together, cash flow the [ __ ] out of them, have them as solid education businesses, and then literally try and take it public on like an XYZ exchange, and then once it's Yeah. Right. Like crazy [ __ ] And then once it's over there in like a foreign market, then build it up from public cash, then take it over here and like do all this stuff. But like, so that's someone who's trying to do it like over here. Then you have the guys that are like in the middle that are kind of trying to do that where it's like holding co-private equity. I had Cole Gordon on. He talked about it where it's like he almost like doesn't want to do that game anymore because he's like build upward build go deep in one thing. He did it with whatever five companies 7 million a month and the profit on it was basically the same as when he was running one standard. So I don't know. I mean I don't know that it's a perfect fit necessarily for info coaching. Um, it's a lot harder with info coaching, I think, to have them where they're actually exitable and then the diversification like through holding and through multiple of them. They all need a standalone at some level unless there's like cuz like when you have these things and like when people like roll up laundry mats like they have all the same like economics and like the business models may be the same, but like unless they all stand alone in that, I don't know. I haven't gone down that road, but like I just yapped a bunch and I'm sure you didn't hear a bunch of it, but like I'm interested to hear your perspective on it though. I agree it's difficult. So like my perspective is I have multiple assets and my my own personal info coaching, you know, can stand alone on its own. And like let's say let's say I eventually want to remove myself from that and sell it which we're in the process of because we're starting to acquire a lot of customers just on the business name launch socials rather than my own personal name. Um I have that I have the pages and then I have the agency thing which I I ran for years. It's really good cash flow and then if it could potentially be be plugged in on a holding co structure I wouldn't hate it. But I'm not married to like the fact of this is my one thing. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to go all in. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to do it this way. It doesn't necessarily have to pan out that way where it sells for me to be successful. So, I think it's worth the risk of trying it cuz I was doing that stuff anyway. Yeah. So, I think we're talking about the same person on or I know who you're talking about more so when you're saying the guy who's growing them and who sold his and did all that, but who else do you know that's done this? I heard so and I'm going to Jeremy Haynes event this weekend and he was talking about how he knew someone or a client of his sold for like minority chunk of it for 20 mil and like all this stuff. the ones that stand out and who was on here that talked about selling um Will Brown and then the other one that talked about sell or that has sold is Hormosi and like who else right like I don't know directly off the top and like even you know Iman talks about it like digital launchpad that he has he's like oh we built it as this thing that could like exit essentially that was non-relyant on him multiple faces inside the product multiple faces and IP they can use for front like all this stuff and even he's like yeah that thing can't sell because it's still too reliant on me. Yeah. And it's like there's not many. And and so for me, that's always like a it's like a I'm doing this and it could be something that I wrap up maybe, but it's not something that I'm married to. And and and I think that's the only way you can approach it because it is so few and far between that people sell these things. You're good. Oh, okay. I thought I thought I cut out for a second. I I I haven't I haven't really heard of anybody that that sold anything. I've seen offers. I've seen I've seen a lot of offers because I've been on a lot of I've been on a lot of offers and I've seen a lot of offers from people maybe to come in to buy something. And then a lot of times I'll also say I think a lot of times people will go to buy some of these companies and then yeah pe people go to buy some of these companies and then they'll do due diligence on it and they're like oh my god it's so [ __ ] up. Like it's the back end because a lot of the people running these offers don't know what they're doing. I audited this this company the other day. They're doing 500 a month and they don't have any tracking. They don't know where their leads come from. They they were making most of their money from organic after I audited it, but they're spending like almost six figures a month in paid. Just like all over the map, and the paid was basically going 100% to waste. Um, a lot of a lot of these offers are just like not in good shape. They're not real companies. They're just kind of thrown together pieces of things and the operators on them are kind of non-existent. So, I think that's one of the reasons a lot of these things can't sell. And then secondarily, they get audited. Like people might be interested. It's like, "Wow, look at that cash flow." And then they get audited and it's like I might have lost you on this, but this this isn't good. Come back. You're good. There you go. Um, so on the what do you think of like offer stack? Like what's your what's your honeypot? I heard you say a trading offer in there. You obviously you said some bisop ones, but like do you generally do stuff that's more MR focused? Do you do stuff that's more high ticket, mid-t like direct to cart like for the clients? Yeah. So really just high ticket. I mean what what you consider high ticket? I know you said three to five. Um which is commonly high ticket in the space. Basically anything you have to sell over the phone I consider high ticket. I know there's like high ticket ecom and physical product but like info wise if you have to sell it over the phone I just I'm like oh it's high ticket. I I sell mostly high ticket. I like MRR. the trading company that sold was MR and I think that's one of the reasons that it did sell because of that consistent recurring. Um I think that everyone this is my personal opinion on people starting everyone should start with high ticket like the velocity of cash flow on it. You have to sell how many courses do you have to sell to make 10K if the course is 100 bucks or 500 bucks a lot. How many you know info coaching do you have to sell to make 10k if it's 5k two or split pay whatever it's like three or four you just make so much more money so much faster and you can do it with a thousand followers and then you build the offer stack out from there so eventually people are going to graduate I like to have a graduation usually on the offers of like you hit this like you've completed it and then they graduate and then it's like oh logically I can offer them this next thing and then you build out the upsell and then as your audience grows and you you get a lot more people that just aren't a fit for it. You can build out the lower ticket, whether that's MR, you can build out, you know, a low ticket course, stuff like that. That's typically how I run it. So, a lot of people never even get to that stage where they need it. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, I think high ticket to start. I also think that doing it through the beauty you have then with that like just inherently is then that people are getting on the phone. So, you have the opportunity to like massage the conversation, learn from it, get feedback. So like you have versus sending them to a sales page is like how's the copy on the page? How's the video on the page? Like you do all this production, you spend all this time trying to like launch an offer with a sales page and like if it doesn't hit, you just burn the cash or you burn the clicks from organic or whatever. And it's like, you know, not as much with organic, but like still it's versus you get someone on the phone, it's like you can maybe come up with different offerings. You can mess with pricing. You can understand maybe they have different like pain points and you want to change what the offer is over the first five or 10 calls. You have the opportunity to do that. And then exactly with the cash flow, but that thing around MR you said is huge. Like we just two a month and a half, two months ago launched like a mid ticket I guess you'd call it. Uh continuity that's MR on the back. So we still sell like one to one over the phone high ticket. That's that they can continue on with that if they want after year one for as many years as they want. But and if they're going to leave because they don't want onetoone personalization, all the stuff it's like, oh, we have this other thing that's basically group coaching model. So it's you get access to everything. You just don't have the onetoone with your coach and it's like half the cost. So it's like okay cool you build this MR engine on the back is that after the year is up. Cool. So it's like a downell continuity. So we try and keep them in the main thing but it's like if we're churning call it 50%. It's like can we recapture 10 20 30% of those into something that's half the price where they still get a lot like you know same result different implementation or different like handholding. Um, and it's also like if you frame it correctly for us, it's almost like a graduation cuz it's like you learned how to do XYZ because there's kind of an education component that comes with the coaching. So it's like once they learn kind of the frameworks and the how we want to do things, then after that they might not need the access to the coach as frequent, but they still want to stay on for access to the app and the community and the this and this and this. So I don't know. We're kind of b bouncing back and forth on like should we push more people into that? It has a higher margin percentage but a lower do uh lower dollars. It's like it costs whatever to pay a coach for one to one to year. It costs this much to pay a coach for, you know, group coaching in like per unit, but the dollars are more on the one to one, right? Cuz let's say it's, you know, 10 grand versus five grand. So like the the margin is higher, but do we want to build up this? Cuz like technically we have recurring revenue through the 1:1 coaching. Like technically we do, but like knowing your numbers on it, what's the retention rate? What's the actual like on an annual basis? You're saying on an annual basis. Yeah. So it's like uh so like right now we're doing a revenue generating event internal to coin Iman's phrase revenue generating event. We do ours internal. So we'll do like renewal special that's 500 or 1,000 bucks off or whatever for the year and it's like a one week thing. It's like hammer the list coaches hit your hit your client rosters do this whole thing. Margin still 80% or whatever because there's no advertising cost there's no sales cost. There's no whatever. It's just like a renewal. It's just the fulfillment cost. And so we'll hammer that. So like yesterday we did like 290. Today we're at like 175 like just ripping and ripping doing those. But like it's a oneweek period and then we so we're trying to like bake an evergreen in and then have like two revenue generating events that are internal only that are like renewal only. So it's big engine on the front that's diversified so that it could sell one day where it's multiple faces, multiple funnels, whatever cost and alignment. They play together. They do their thing. You get the client. They sit in this onetoone coaching thing that has obviously a lesser margin because it has the cost to acquire the customer. It has the sales rep. It has the fulfillment. It has all the things. X contribution overhead exists. And then after year one is like, do you want to stay or in these two revenue generating events, do you want to add a year or two years for a slight discount because the margin's still great? or at the end of your term in an evergreen setting, do you want to downell continuity into this other program that's like you don't need a onetoone coach anymore, but you want to stay is like the current frame. Really interesting. I um it's it's interesting. I think the the most interesting point that you made is like technically we have recurring, but what's how many Yeah. Yeah. It's not a huge thing. Yeah. churn goes crazy on stuff like this. What What is your churn number on that? Do you know? So high. Yes, I know. And I refuse to It's high. Like we had we had an issue with like how we were doing payment collection. We were letting them check out with their own external financing when they wanted to. And we hit it pretty hard last year. So we had a bunch of people that were selecting like payment terms that were different than what the term length was. So like example, someone clicked 18 or 24month financing for a 12-month program. So like the you know churn on those are high. But now that we've put we didn't have we have you know a retention team now that's basically sales reps that we didn't have prior like once we've implemented all these things it's like 20 30 40 50 like are staying now and then now you include these renewal numbers and it's like 50 60 like so it's getting up there but like it was [ __ ] for a long time like you know we bas if you just do net net it's like 50% call it we have like you know x amount of thousands of clients right now and then we have call it 10,000 or whatever that are that have come through on that specific offering we have. Yeah. So, blah blah blah. But like it's getting way better. And then if you bl you blend all these numbers, but I'm interested for so to kind of get off that a little, but for sales and I don't know if I just lost you. I think I did. Someone asked this question. I think it's a good question because I have a very strong belief on it. Should be throwing anothers in. Are you back? Are you back? Yeah. Yeah, I'm back. I have Go for it. Yeah. Go ahead. No, go for it. You had some. Oh, I was gonna say, so someone asked on here sales-wise, and I have a very interesting like belief on this, but what is your because someone asked, do you have sales team in place for your high ticket offers, Nick? So, if you have multiple of these, you have multiple sales managers, sales sales teams, like how do you do that? Of course. So, the way the way we like to run it, like, of course, we always have sales teams in place. Usually, it's setters, closers. Um, we we we the way the way we la Okay, so it because there's multiple layers, right? That's why I'm I'm trying to figure out which one to attack first. So like the guys that we launch, the founder is selling it. I'm like, dude, you don't they try everyone tries to hire a salesperson and I'm like, dude, you don't even know what the offer is yet. Like you need to go in, you need to sell it. And kind of to your point earlier, take those 10, 15, 20 calls. I say get 10 20 sales first and then fulfill those people just to get the feedback from them to know what the offer should be. You then take all that information and data. You relaunch it fully like what I would call a hard launch. It's like I consider those first 20 sales like a soft launch. Yeah. You know, get those deals from DMs, get scrappy, get those people in, get the feedback, get the data. Then you hard launch it with like hard CTAs, retargeting ads, the full thing. You put the full system together. you still take the calls once it's working from there. Like I don't know why I'm a fan. I'm a fan. I know so many people would not who would not do that. So like that's why I'm kind of like laughing but like I'm I'm completely in alignment. Got it. You guys like anyone starting an offer has to take the calls because you're just you don't have any visibility if you don't and then the sales guy isn't recording. You don't know what his experience is. He's on five different offers. He's all over the place. Your offer isn't enticing yet because it's not making enough money. You have to take the calls first. You get all that feedback, all that data. You know how it works. You hard launch it. You get enough volume there where you can put one closer into place and one setter into place and you build from there. And then once you have a few closers, a few setters, you put a sales manager into place. So that's the system I run for every offer, whether it's starting all the way to big offer doing 500 a month, mill a month, whatever. We're mostly like at at the top end. we're in like 500ish range on average. Uh I have another point on that as well I want to touch on, but um so so it scales, right? It really depends on the stage someone's at, but we always aim to build a sales team. Like we always want to remove the main person that that's the face of everything from everything except for like a fulfillment touch point usually and all the front end, right? They we just want them to be the face, you know? If we can get them to that position, of course, we want to have a sales team. An interesting point. I have two points actually cuz I cut out on the recurring. Something we've been testing is a a high ticket front end like a five six whatever on the front end and then like a 200 or a 400 a month for the entire year. So on the front end on that purchase we get the we get the big payment and then we build recurring into the first year. I'm not saying it works. I'm not saying it works. I don't know. I'm testing it as we speak right now. Um, but we've had a few sales on it. Like people aren't Of course I lost you on the good part. No. Right. There you go. I got you back. Yeah. So, the two people the two people I know that do this that crush with it. Onyx and Gal does this when we were at his, that's how he pitched his. So, it's like an upfront join fee and then it drops into monthly. And then same with uh one of the best masterminds that I'm in that we literally don't even use really anymore, but we're in Ezra Firestone's Blue Ribbon Mastermind. So, ecom whatever. and he's just live showing him building and scaling massive businesses. Um, and his is like that. It was like I don't even know what the number is. It was 5K or 10K or whatever up front and then like 1,200 or 1,500 a month. I think it works a lot for the ones where it's like really community- based and like stay in. I don't know how. And like the for like you're in it forever, right? It's the lifer mastermind model more so than the educationbased or like you know one-year term contract fulfillment which frankly is like what ours is kind of, right? It's like we have all these our client wins channel just fire off and it's like they're doing such a good job of fulfilling on the contract for the year. It just wasn't really framed up until like 3 to four months ago in a way that's like this is a forever thing and we didn't have the other offers and we didn't have the other like you know so I mean I agree. Uh what are you what are you selling that works for monthly and is it for the rest of the term or is it like indefinitely framed? We we're just testing an adjustment to the pitch where it is a big upfront fee and then we just add in the monthly fee and seeing if it takes and it's taking a little bit. Uh it's somewhat working. I lost you. This [ __ ] [ __ ] Sorry guys, we having mad technical difficulties with this, but I think Here we go. You're good. I I I just want to apologize to you, dude. You don't Why? Well, cuz cuz come on, man. I got to have my [ __ ] together here. Although I am You're good. I am three feet from the router. You're good. You're good. No, I am the most No, I am the most chill in the world about this stuff. I don't This is all good. So So what were we saying? So you the how you changed the pitch is what I last heard. Dude, we just pitched a different price. Like we didn't change anything on the pitch except we're testing a different price of like Yeah, it's this plus this monthly and and we're not getting many nos. Um how do you see the actual like LTV of it change though? Or like what's the time time to churn or cuz that's the thing that I'm like okay cool if we just threw it in. It was like the startup thing and then this. Well, because that's an interesting thought though. I mean, I'm kind of thinking about that. That's like because we have like so much organic like it's mainly 90% organic that we acquire customers from. There's very very little churn like ever. Like our payment plan collections the price on the what is like a monthly example or what's a pitch example? So, it's 2K up front and then like 300 a month or like five and then two or or four and then five. Uh we've been playing with it just a little bit. Uh I don't know if I'll keep it, but it's it's just something to test. I lost you again. You're back. You're good. Yeah. Interesting. So for us, I know that's like a very interesting model because I'm like so I'm trying we're going to try to achieve that but not through we're trying to do it through additional offerings. So like same way that somebody would do 5K upfront with a to get like the info education portal and then once they're in there there's a $200 a month software they use for trading or for to find suppliers for drop shipping or whatever, right? So it's like you pair two offers together, not price one offer in two ways. So like we're trying we're going to try and play that game with like what else do they buy, right? So it's like supplements. Is it this? Is it that? Um so there's like two monetization methods but two different pricing models or price or whatever monetization types. Um so that's like a but that's a very interesting frame cuz I know that crushes for masterminds. I know it crushes for masterminds. I just wonder how if we could even make that work for the front layer of info coaching. I'm not sure. That's why we're testing it. We're gonna find out. So, okay. Now, around the sales team. So, my strong belief, and I'm curious on yours, so you're building sales teams in-house. Yes. Come on, man. It's the life we live. Um, so with you're building them in-house, but like my belief on this and how it shifted over now this range is like I believe in sales agencies, which I never had one. I never used one. I tried to use one for $1099 like management, but we never used one that was full- encompassing. Now there's these guys who like crush it that do like 20% rips and they handle the whole thing which obviously is a little more expensive than if you run in house cuz you let's say you run at 10%, you have setters you have three whatever 3 to 5% so you're at 15 maybe have a manager you're at 17 like you can save for sure by going direct but I am under the impression that the headcount equals the headache and it becomes a massive issue over time. when you're trying to scale, it becomes the biggest headache versus why not just worry about marketing more inflow. Why not just worry about ascension and retention and product and just like get rid of the sales team? Because all these info coaching, cash flow businesses run so lean. It's all about cash flow. It's all about this like to then manage two, five, 10 closers and potentially then two, five, 10 setters is like a whole new you you introduce like managing of people which doesn't really exist in info coaching at like the small or medium scale. Yep. So, I've worked with tons of agencies, lots of them. I think some sales agencies are really good. I think some are not so good. It's hit or miss. Like, you know how it is. It's the agency game. I only have two guys. I only have two guys I recommend. For context, yeah, it's it's the agency game in general. Um, and I have a few guys I recommend. Of course, I I probably have a control issue. I like I like to have the the control like in house of you know we I'm it's also I know every part of the process because this is just my game. So I in a sense am a sales agency if that makes sense. Yeah. When I manage other offers. Yeah that makes sense. So so it's like I'm just going to do it for for these offers. Um that's that that's my take on it. But yeah, agencies in general, like there's there's some agencies out there that can do it better than you can or I can or anybody watching can, but there's super few and far between. And how much cash and time do you burn trying to find that agency and a lot of times it's a lot. I mean, I've I've been there. So, yeah, we did that with marketing and just burned it. Like just dumbass burned it. Like we just didn't want to worry about marketing, which is the stupidest thing. But for a minute, it was like just like such a headache. We're like, "Oh, we'll just use this agency. We're getting good results. We're like, cool." Agency kind of started to flip, like falter a little. So, we moved to another agency that had all these big promises and experience and we're like, "Oh, we're good." And just boom, next thing you know, we're spending 130 grand a month or whatever to an agency. CPA is rising at the same time, like both those in tandem, and it was like not good. But yeah, I don't know. I think I think the sales thing's big. So, you just said something interesting and like I don't you don't have to dox your numbers by any means, but how do you view your monetization model? Like how does the math work? Cuz like you know a sales agency like I said a lot of the time will take 20, some take 25. I've heard some take less than 20 but most are around 20. They staff everyone. You're doing essentially the management portion but like you said it's kind of built into the into the model already where acquisition you know sales cost will be in there. What you can give ranges, but like what is like someone who runs your model? Ahmed was on here and talked to his number like rough because he does a similar thing. He basically like growth operates the wrong word, but he kind of does like a toz management of these entire offers and he'll be like and he gets a rev share rep is how he does it because there's no uh ad cost really because it's almost all organic. So it's basically the same probably as yours. But I've heard people can get 20. I've heard people get 40. I've heard like when they're really really hands-on. I heard guys that just kind of like co-o and do 10. Like I'm usually the 15 to 25% range, but I also do it on purpose. Like I think I could probably push it up to 30 to to 40. But do I want to have that level of responsibility on multiple different businesses and I don't cuz then you know there's a bad profit month, you know, something bad happens, something breaks, they're coming to you as a source of funds. Hey, you got to cover that negative. You know, I don't want to deal with that. So yeah, I I like a balance of I'm I'm getting compensated, you know, on a level that I deem fair. You cut again. I'm You're back. You're good. You're good. Yeah. No, you I mean, dude, so I have talked to many people on this cuz like this was kind of like a version and like still is cooking of like maybe where my land can live cuz I like I'm not going to sell anything like direct. performance in my mind is completely different like performance based anything. So like no fe like so how do you draw the line on what you're willing to service and not because like what you just said there is like oh if I took 40% I feel like I would have more responsibility or I would have you know capital calls or I'd have whatever like how do you clearly define the line as okay cool we're going to take 25% but like the buck stops here on where you're willing to do service delivery or help or whatever. coffee break. I have like four stems going at the same right time right now, guys. So, you're back. You're good. So, how do you how do you how do you view where you draw the line in the sand in terms of that? To me, to me, the best way to do it is have an abundance of the lead flow where I I don't have to just work with someone because the money is right. I I can work with them because I like them and I know they're a solid person and I know they're they're going to pay on time and I know they're going to be cool to work with and they're not going to bring in extra headaches. And for me, I guess I think the line you were asking about maybe outside of that is like the dollar amount and or the percent. For me, it's this is probably worth it. I would pay it if I own the business, but also I'm not taking on too much risk or or too much responsibility. And it's kind of that mix. And I find 15 to 25 is good for that. And I can come in and do a lot of hands-on stuff and then I can slowly move towards consulting, which is less hands-on and a lot less of like my time involved. Yeah, that's kind of how I'm viewing it, too. I mean like you hear guys who are investors and like of true like actual capital not just time and they will draw the line in the sand like no I'm I'm strictly a financial partner I'm strictly a this so I just think it's so much it's just so difficult to draw the line in the sand on where you want to do it with consulting where you want to do it with time where you want to do it with how much you want to dedicate to the offer but if you see the upside it's like all of a sudden you want to like 10x lean in and you're like oh this one could go to two or three million a month if I just put some more time in it and then it's like okay you want to you want to have the control like you said to be able to like cherrypick that and be like I want to lean in on this one you can keep your percent but like you choose to lean in versus like what is the minimum I think that's like the biggest piece for me on like how I look at it so yeah so you're are are you going to kind of turn your operation into like multiple of these and not just so core core biz is core biz that thing is going to go like the idea is that it almost grows beyond me so like I it's owner operate right now for Sure. Um but like even day by day like there's such a strong team. Like the biggest thing the issue we have right now is like such strong players almost like too many chefs in the kitchen or like not getting the efficiency out of team we have. So that's why you know you look at these like profit numbers or this overhead thing. And again this might be like a pipe dream for me even saying it and like I could just be wrong on this and in six months I'm like damn we burned millions of dollars on payroll and whatever. But like my belief is and you cut out I think so. Sorry. But my belief of it is more around the idea that if I can get the team efficiencies and the proper people in place kind of before that so like the seuite and then the proper players on the team and then get the operation operator piece handled to where they get the efficiencies out of that team. I think I just cut out there for you, but the the basically seuite just having a team of sickos, which is basically what we have right now. And right now the two biggest levers are getting efficiencies out of them and their teams. So like layering in operations and management for them and like helping them with that. So I just got a project manager last week that starts next week. I think it's going to be huge. And then the big lever is like deploying that within marketing because CPA is the biggest lever in terms of profit for us right now. Like by far by far. So, so, so I don't know if that answers the question, but essentially we're trying we're going to build main code to the point that it's I as an owner, not as an owner operator. And then my goal is to continue to stay within info coaching, connect with all these people, do all this stuff. And like there's so many like I get DMs that are like, "Oh, I'll pay 50 grand for consulting. I'll pay, you know, I'll give you x percentage of my company. I'll do I just deny everything right now." And it's like I want to partner with the right people and do the right stuff if that becomes, but like I also don't want it to be a distraction. So, right now my focus is main co and then I'm kind of cooking up side co thing that would be a partnership version of this. Um, but I'm not going to public announce anything until I'm like dead set sure on it. Hell yeah, man. That is awesome, bro. And uh I respect that actually leads into this next one on here. Someone asked in here and I'm curious on yours for saying no. What's the key to longevity in info game and does it essentially come down to looking at data and Oh, did I lose you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was just saying I was just saying I respect a lot the fact that you know you're you're sticking to the the main thing and saying no to the money in the DMs even though it's like super easy. Yeah. I just like don't want to one I just don't want to be that person. Two, the second I take 50 grand from someone if they don't make like you know 500 grand like I will not sleep at night and like I'm just that person and I don't like that. Everything I've always done is performance based. It's almost like a lack of confidence at some level or something, right? Where it's like these guys who can charge 50 grand are like, "Oh, my hour was worth it." And if they don't implement it, that's on them. Like, I'm just not there as like a person to where I feel comfortable doing that or like selling that. It's just not who I currently am or I'm okay with. So, I like the idea of performance based. I've always done performance based. I've always done that. And it's like if I help you and it gets XYZ, like I'm cool with you making 10 million, I make a million on it and like whatever type of arrangement or 5 million on it, you make 10 or whatever. Um, so yeah, that's been mine on it. But someone asked on here and I'm actually curious on this. So what's the key to longevity in info game? And does it essentially come down to looking at data and continuous optimization, which I think those are kind of like two different questions because I don't think it's a second one, but what's your what do you think the key to longevity in the info game is? Well, especially if it's a personal brand, it's being yourself. And this is what we help people. This is what I help people with every day. There are so many people that are just like, I'm going to do this thing for the camera. And I think eventually on like a spiritual level, it eats at your soul to do some [ __ ] that you don't really believe in or isn't you. And that's going to burn you out. And then secondarily, eventually you're going to [ __ ] somebody over if you're not acting out of the correct interests. And that that's it. like once once you only have the one reputation and people have gotten the reputations back, but it's not common. You know, it cooks people. So, so it's really just being authentically actually yourself and and not pretending to be somebody that you're not. And I think that happens a lot with the influencer, personal brand, you know, type of individual. Um, I also think the second thing which is just a standard business thing is cash flow is number one and don't outspend your cash flow to where you know you have to go into debt to to keep things running and stuff like that. Just basic business 101. Um, I think those are the two main things that I see at least. I'm curious what you see. Yeah, with info I have a hard hard stop in three, but uh in info it's I always say there's a difference between someone who's like they they always say like oh what offer are you on or what offer are you running and there's a big difference between offer and business and like you know those are just two words but like depending on how you look at them it is a very very large difference and there are the guys that are the personal brand dudes and it used to be forever in direct response it's like what's my new offer and constantly spinning up a new mechanism and a new mechanism and selling essentially the same thing with different Like there's truth to that in messaging and marketing, but there's not really truth to that in like your business model and like you're not building a business when you're just going offer to offer to offer unless you're building a machine that is offered to offer like you're doing, you know, an Agora or something. But like I don't know, I'm I'm under the belief that info will continue to change. The AI piece will continue to change, especially I think I already right now see a ton of stuff happening with like coaching being more so than info. um or info being used as a way to then sell coaching for the higher ticket stuff. Um but yeah, I mean I think longevity just exists like you said being good person being, you know, iterating on your product is different than jumping from offer to offer to offer. That's number one as well. Like I I don't know how I didn't think of that, but like I also kind of maybe tied that in with authenticity. If you're the guy that sells drop shipping one day and then you flip to now your theme pages and now you're agency and now you're crypto, now you're AI. Yeah. you know, your reputation is going to get cooked doing that. And second, you're never going to get the long-term client results that you could get to get the compounding effect to go really big. It just doesn't happen. Yeah. I know you got to go. Yeah. No, this was No, this was solid. I know we had obviously some issues. So, when you're out of the Smoky Mountains, we'll rip around, too, because now you clearly have a lot of perspective and you do it from a different angle than I do, which I like. Yeah, man. Uh, it was great and I appreciate you having me on and what you're doing is awesome and the YouTube is awesome and uh, we definitely I mean if you'll have me again I will I promise I promise the good Wi-Fi will be there. We'll run a proper call. Yeah, 100%. And I won't have a hard stop in an hour. I never have that. I usually do this at the tail end of the day, but someone booked in and I figured that would be helpful. I don't actually It's not even true. No one can book in. I don't have any calendar links. So cool, man. Y, we'll talk soon. Appreciate you. Take care. M I
