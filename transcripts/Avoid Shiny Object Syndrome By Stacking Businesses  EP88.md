# Avoid Shiny Object Syndrome By "Stacking" Businesses | EP88
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZISk534Mamc

In today's video, we're going to be talking about avoiding shiny object syndrome by stacking. All of us get shiny object syndrome, whether we see lead genen, ecom, info coaching, personal brand, whatever, and think that it is a better, faster, more fun, whatever way to make money online. And I'm telling you right now, the grass is always greener where you water it. Okay? Sounds cliche, but we're going to break it down today. Go through a couple different niches, and then how you could stack these business models on top of each other through acquisition models, monetization models, and fulfillment models. All right, this is going to be a fun one. Good thought exercise and yeah, go through some real life examples. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done over 76 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. All right, so let's get into it. This is going to be a fun one just because this is exactly what's on my brain right now. So avoiding shiny objects. These are just some common ones and even another one that was on here that I didn't throw. We're going to build this board live today which we usually don't do. So software. So a lot of people talk info coaching pros and cons. We're going to quick go through. So info coaching people see as a quick win. They see it as quick cash. They see it as easy to fill and deliver. And they are kind of correct. Okay. Um it is generally speaking a pretty high margin business especially if you are the one doing the info or coaching or if you're just giving a login access. Uh it's really just your marketing expense. Right. So, in your acquisition, if you're doing direct to cart, you are doing marketing direct to something and then giving them monetization is generally either one-time access if it's info or recurring model if there's some sort of coaching or continuation. And fulfillment is going to be a login access and some group coaching calls. As it gets more uh intense or depending on the model, you can have onetoone coaches, you can have group coaches, you can have all those things, but this generally speaking is a pretty high margin biz. physical ecom. People see the exit value. People see the just run an ad, make the like there's there's a lot of ways that people look at this, but depending if you're doing drop shipping, branded drop shipping, branded normal full inventory, whatever, it just has a sexier appeal for like a real business and real growth. You have recurring customers depending you play the MR game and you have recurring, if you have consumables or something, people come back to purchase. Um, but this has always been very attractive to me. Um, especially when they're kind of more faceless. Buy, sell, private equity. This is like the hot thing right now. You could also call it like hold co. Uh I'm going to get into this one a lot later, but this is like the tunch above that everyone wants to get to and they want to own multiple of these businesses and these business models and that's how they scratch the itch. Lead gen affiliate cash in cash out is a simple way everyone looks at it. You run $100,000 a day in ads, you make 120 grand back, you clear 20 and that's that. This goes so much deeper and that is such an over uh simplification of the business model because there are data plays, there is entire team plays. These have exit ability as well, especially on the lead genen side. I love this. Every 3 days, I want to go start one of these. Um, but that's what we're going to talk about here. Stacking these so you don't get shiny object syndrome. Software, very sexy thing for a lot of people. Uh, whether it's bolted on the back, it's a standalone thing. Real estate. This is kind of a side tangent, but this is more of the what I mean by this is more so of actually kind of doing it active but doing it more so for taxation investing that piece and then personal brand is the hot topic right so everyone's talking about doing personal brands everyone's talking about growing in that way and generally then doing it for info coaching so they want the fame they want the clout they then want to charge people for info coaching generally on top of one of these business models um all right So let's go through some examples. I'm going to use women's fitness on this because it's our exact example and how I'm looking at stacking these. So for us, women's fitness and let's walk through this right now. For us, acquisition models, let's start from the back. So fulfillment model for us is currently one-to-one coaching, but it is done through not us being the coach uh through someone else. So there's hard cost to that uh of having a team to do so. The monetization model is annual coaching. So there are we technically do have some info in here um that is one time but majority of it is going to be annualized coaching and then acquisition models for us is 99% paid and they're going through three different types of funnels and I have a ton of videos on the channel talking about that. Okay. Now, sitting in this knowing that we sell info coaching. Okay. I want to do all of these. I want to go I want a software. I want personal brand. I want lead genen affiliate. Like I want all of these. But it is shiny shiny. And it they don't make sense to put inside the same thing except a couple of them. Okay? And that's what I'm talking about here when I say stacking. So for us, I want to do physical ecom. I'm going to bring physical ecom into this business. So let's move this actually over here. So I want to stack these models in this way. So we can continue to have info coaching but then we can also have physical ecom that exists let's say to start on the back to existing customers but then gets becomes full force where it is front end and you can sell things direct but I want these to feed each other and live within the same as a multiplier effect not as a distraction where now all of a sudden I have this xyz ex e-commerce company that's for dogs. Okay, cuz now I'm running this business and I'm running this business and then also I want to do life insurance, lead gen and like all these other things and I have a fear that I will then fail at all of them. Okay, so in current state for me, let's move these back. This is the plan. We're going to do this. We're going to stack this. There is a potential play to do this, but that is much different beast as well. A whole dedicated team, the proper whatever, and maybe even should be standalone. Okay, so these are the three we're stacking right here. And then through these same acquisition, monetization and fulfillment models, there may be some differences for fulfillment where we do group. There may be differences for info where it is login access and even mid ticket physical ecom. This can exist either on the front end or the back end. Okay, so kind of doesn't really fit in this model, but uh the front end or the back end, meaning that we are sending ads direct to it because it's a hero product that can do that. And then software generally speaking unless it's B2B is going to exist on the back in some capacity and really not be a software that's like standalone in at all. Okay. So this is more so we would build software internal but not scale it up that it's like a standalone company in current state. Okay. Now let's go through some of these other ones. Dogs and let's take them to the nth degree. So let's put our women's fitness back. Let's put our info. We'll leave these over here. So next one. Let's say dogs. I know people that do millions of dollars a month in dog training that do it in dog that do physical businesses of draw dog in person training right so you can take this one to the nth degree and the skills that you learn through the online business piece whether that is and which is mainly around the acquisition it can kind of be around these two but like it's mainly around this because it's going to be your p paid advertising your organic your conversion cycle of whether you're doing what type of offer or phone sales or whatever I'm kind of bucketing that all into acquisition models but a Very clean example of this is info that is you know dog training or is dog XYZ. Okay. Now with that you have oops let me just move this over here. You have the exact same play and the playbook that you can run. Okay. Let's remove software from here but let's go like this. Okay. So you have info coaching. This can already do millions of dollars a month just as is. Okay. Whether that is literally in person or completely remote both work. And then physical e-commerce. I know guys who do multiple multiple millions a month by selling physical e-commerce like the dog sauce guys or whatever that company's called. Um supplements like in that game uh physical toys and products like whether that's branded drop ship or your own full-on situation like you can take any of these to the nth degree. Going further beyond that there is real estate plays, there are private equity plays, there are lead genen plays. So real estate I know people who own dog physical kennels and situations like that. not the same people that do this, which is interesting. Um, but you can take that to the nth degree. Leadgen, I know guys who do literally there are affiliate networks that have uh dog food, dog, whatever processing things you can do lead genen. So, all of where I'm going with this is basically saying taking one of these niches to the nth degree instead of trying to have a dog food business over here on the side and this and this. And there are people who crush it at this. So, this is not like a, you know, they are more so uh exemption or whatever. there there are kind of like unicorns out here that do that well. You know, you got your Elon Musk of the world, but like where can you overlap and stack the skill set and the business models on top of each other within a specific niche? Okay, so let's take vegan food. Same thing here. Uh my mom has a blog that's a vegan blog and how could you take it further? So that doesn't really exist in info coaching. It's more of a display and whatever. So it's kind of actually more a little bit lead genen affiliate but like super low scale. Um it's display ads, right, is what it does. But on top of that, the next business model that she would easily be able to do is to sell info. So cookbooks, um, education classes on, you know, 10day vegan quick start, whatever. Like they have ClickBank products around this. Coaching is the next tier up that could be mid-t that would be teaching how to do XYZ within the vegan food niche. There are software plays that I know that people have vegan software that have softwares that are around vegan meal planning and can stack those on top of each other. The personal brand exists basically on top of this. So this is her big play where she has this and then could go into any of these verticals. Physical ecom she can then take that and have and again this is not a business model I'm trying to pursue so FYI but um physical e-commerce where I know people who have made like this sounds crazy but they have like tofu presses and stuff that do hundreds of thousands of dollars a month that to my understanding have zero paid advertising have nothing and literally just exist okay and they have little patented things and whatever. So like there is the depth you can take this real estate. This is going like mogul status and I'm not going to go there but that lead genen affiliate you can easily layer on and then buy sell private equity. Now with this one and I haven't really talked about this one much through these models but there are plays that people have holding companies that are all health food oriented that are all businesses that are in whatever natural XYZ niche and it would not be far stretched for someone to have a vegan hold co that or private equity co that only does that. Now, let's get into some like actuals on like what my play is here and stop talking about some of these examples. So, if you go into here and say where we're currently at or what where I exist in this. Okay, so my play right now is essentially I'm doing this personal brand thing. Then I have this women's fitness thing where I'm trying to stack these. Okay, so I hate moving these while I'm talking to you guys. This is like difficult. All right, so this is kind of the play book we're running right now. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. But I'm not going to. The only thing and how I'm starting to navigate is I'm going to attempt to stack these on top of each other with this. Okay. So, kind of look at these like tiers. So, within the women's fitness, we're going to do info coaching. And this alone can be scaled to 10 million a month. I know people who have done 10 million a month just in this gambit, right? Not that big of a deal. So, info coaching layer in physical e-commerce as a why wouldn't you land grab whether that's through partnership or on your own. Whether this chooses to stand alone on itself on front end or not is different. Okay, so that's one playbook. Now there's me as an individual. I'm sitting essentially like this. Okay, so this is what I do here. And instead of being like, oh, let's go start this lead genen business on the side and do this where the skills that are overlapping and stacking are basically just the paid advertising side. Okay? And like we already have team for that, we already have that. It just sounds like a fun thing to me to do and I'm just holding off on doing it. Uh unless I'd had proper partners and doing that. So, what I'm thinking more so is leaning more in this land, which is so cliche and what everyone is talking about doing, but I have a theory on how to do it in a more strategic way for this info coaching land. So, a lot of people what they're going to do is they're going to go up and they're going to build this whole business model and they're going to go over here in this private equity bucket and be like, "Oh, now I'm also going to do this in I'm going to have a lead genen company and I'm gonna have a software company. I'm gonna have I'm gonna have a bunch of real estate. I'm going to do it across uh landscaping and life insurance and dogs and women's fitness." And then like that is not my play. I'm trying to stay navigated between a specific niche and a specific type of industry. Okay. So, if all I know 99% of what I know is within this industry, I want to learn this and I'm going to do it within this vehicle. Okay. Now, the other piece is what I'm building on top of here, which is me as an individual and the n and as I navigate throughout this, I'm not going to pinch myself just in this specific industry and I did not do that off this from the start because I am more so on this. Okay. Okay, so my personal brand exists within this space. Now, instead of going, "Oh, cool. I'm going to go start this physical e-commerce company that does dog food or do this lead genen affiliate thing that does insurance." My theory and where I'm trying to skill stack on top of each other is going to be keeping the personal brand highlighted in the info coaching space, but changing out the fulfillment model and the monetization model of this. So, how do I do this? and where do I live in this land where I can monetize this without equity play and fulfill this by not having 92 meetings a week where I have you know I'm sitting in sea levels or whatever or above sea level whatever you want to look at of all these different companies instead the fulfillment model being something and I'll I'll get into this later more when I get into when I actually start to build some of this out but info coaching buy sell private equity style but not as much on the sell okay so I'm thinking of this in kind of a different way. And I'll get into this on other videos, but that's kind of how my arc is looking right now. Now, let's use some more examples on here and then I'll shut up because this is just kind of like a circular video. Life insurance. All of you ask me all of the time, how would I start this today? What niche would I go into? Whatever. Let's use life insurance as a great example here and break down all of these. So, life insurance, I know people who have done info coaching in life insurance, have sold an entire thing for call it 5 or 10K. I forget the exact price point. So it might have been cheaper. They were doing direct to cart where they sold info coaching and did that right here. Okay. It was I think a 2K product, maybe 5K, I don't know. I don't remember. Um but once they were inside there, all of the product itself was talking about using XYZ system and that system was life insurance. Now the guys who were selling this info coaching were also licensed life insurance reps and then provided life insurance for all these guys in whole life and IL whatever they were using and made commissions on that. So, let's say they made a three to 5x rorowaz on the front. Let's say they broke even on the front. Who cares? The amount of money they were making then on commissions on the back end from this piece was massive. They also went the next layer to then say you're going to use it through real estate. So, they had other vehicles they made money in like funds, like flips, like pre- ready flips, like all these other things. So, they made money on info coaching. They made money on life insurance itself, not just as an industry, but as an actual product and skew. Then they also used multiple vehicles in real estate and they stacked these all into each other and just made a massive multiplier because there is somebody out there who will sell the same program for 2k or 5k and is going to make their 2 to 3x on rorowaz and that is it. And their back end might be some mastermind or something where they just talk about this stuff more high level. These guys had multiple ways to monetize as well as fulfill that made them 5 10 30x on the back end. Okay, so that was the beauty of that one. Now that is what I would do today. So I would do life insurance in some capacity likely uh as an example or something in the financial industry uh services. There's a lead genen play where you can do paper call, you can do forms, you can do whatever. So there's an easy not I want to say easy, easy is the wrong word. There's a simple framework and playbook that people run this in lead genen and affiliate. I know another guy that went the next layer and built a software that's not necessarily a standalone software but more a marketplace for the lead flow that he buys in lead genen and affiliate. You can then have info, coaching, real estate. This is we're just going to remove real estate because that's where it's going to get confusing. Um, and then runs them through here and then also has their personal brand tied into here. Okay. They don't really do any private equity plays. They don't really do any physical e-commerce plays. But all to say, they're loading these on top of each other to make it so they already got an offer for this to to exit this business. Um, just by doing the lead genen piece, the software piece, personal brand exists kind of outside of it. It is not the actual flow of it, but they talk about it as a personal brand and then they have info coaching that's kind of on top of it teaching this model. But this piece of the model was already offered to be acquired. Uh somebody already sent them an offer. So, a lot of ways to cut the cake. Uh a lot of ways to look at this. I feel like I'm being a bit confusing here, but I kind of don't care. Um this is just what I'm thinking about right now and how I'm trying to avoid shiny object syndrome by stacking these on top of each other. So, this is my example over here right now. This and this are the two core things I'm doing with the idea of doing this, this and this, right? And still never selling anything. Okay? Because I don't want to sell anything and I don't want to have that on the conscious of now I have to go help all these people who I've accepted money from. So that's the plan. Uh some of these other videos I'm going to go into some more stuff that's happening with us here because we're doing some crazy stuff and scaling really aggressively. Um, but right now it's just more interviews, more conversations around that. Today is day 87 in a row of us doing this. Um, I do want to talk about this one. Sorry, this video is all over the place. Uh, so this one I know somebody who is doing this right now and it's actually a different sport. So I'm not going to dox them because they are crushing and I don't want them to I like their business too much. So they are doing some different sport. Let's say it's for goalies for soccer. Okay. So they are teaching info coaching. They're the best and the best in the world. They have remote and they also have in-person. They're not necessarily making money on the real estate, but they have physical locations. They have a personal brand on top of it that runs it like an info coaching business or like a true expertled info coaching business, but it is branded. Um, so they have people that are communicating there. They do I think it's close to a million bucks a month right now through organic. They have a software that's basically an app. So it's not again a standalone software. It's just part of the fulfillment model and delivery. They don't do anything on lead genen affiliate. They do have some physical ecom and that is that. So the big play for them though is this model right here just selling off this. This is small. This is just piece of the puzzle and this is piece of the puzzle. But because of the niche that they're in, they have so much opportunity on the back end and it's almost all organic. So they have great margins because they don't do paid right now. But they have so much to squeeze within this that already exists. And then even more things on the backend fulfillment such as I don't want I don't want to give away their sauce, but there's big big big big like multi-million dollar backend plays um that works off of a niche like this. And yeah, so I don't want to give away too much of their stuff, but all I'm saying is whether it's these or whether you layer in a couple other online business things that people do, there are a lot of ways to cut one niche and break it down and make money from multiple things that excite you and that are fun all within the same instead of having to spin up a bunch of different businesses in different niches or different sides and then have them all be subpar. Okay, this was confusing. I'm sure it was even confusing for me. So, apologies for that. But let me know if you guys have any thoughts around this or some other ways you look at this. Uh, this is a constant thought process I'm having. And, uh, I think this is going to be my game plan for sure. Um, this is going to be my game plan. So, that's current state. We'll see. Things change quickly, but I will talk to you guys soon. Uh, all the videos are here. Like I said, today's day 87, I believe, in a row. I'm running this up to 100 and then we'll see. Um, but yeah, you guys can go here and see all the videos, find stuff that is specific to you, tech, sales, marketing, ops, all the things. And let me know if you have any questions. Uh, Instagram's the best. X is also good. and I'll talk to you guys soon.
