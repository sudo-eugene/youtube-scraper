# The Tech Stack Behind a $70M Call Funnel (Tools We Use) | E4
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7os4coBvW0s

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the call funnel Tech stack that we use to do 70 million through one funnel uh what this channel is is essentially me just sharing what we've done what's worked for us what has not worked for us and what we're currently doing now um so this is the stack that we used first things first is any of these work for anything you can use four different crms and they'll still work you can use four different website hosting platforms and they still work um so it really is specific to you I just want to go through what's worked for us so no guru no fluff this is just what we did and what we're currently doing in March of 2025 and hopefully I'll be able to document and show kind of as we evolve throughout this and go into the nine figure range and what we're using then so for now uh automations what we use right now is zapier and I'm doing this in private so I can ideally just show you guys just all the homepages of the sites but so we use zaps uh a lot of people use make nowadays we've done it for some stuff but this has just been the easiest in all honesty we kind of built this thing duct tap together um so one piece at a time since then we have you know two and a half million zaps a month that fire now uh some craziness there but this is what we use for almost everything still to this day we have since moved a bunch of it to custom um so we have a bunch of stuff that's like web hook dra and we have an our database but overall everything's still on zap all right websites I have another video on the channel that's about this uh initially we started on clickfunnels then moved to WordPress not.com but you know what I mean so we started on click funnel that's where we did the first whatever few hundred thousand probably actually over a million um then we moved to Wordpress not.com but.org self-hosted um and then we would do we did that because we wanted more content consumption the blog functionality stuff like that where clickfunnels at that point was just 1.0 so they didn't offer the um kind of like content consumption model the homepage the navigation stuff like that and then just recently we moved to web flow in the beginning of 2025 just because we wanted it for the design and we really just needed an overhaul um it's my understanding that we could have just rebuilt uh completely from scratch on web on WordPress and gotten the same result uh I'm a big fan of Wordpress I use it on other companies and other sites but we want to move to web flow for the design just kind of out of the box functionality and we still use devs for that but that's essentially the stack that we've used for website and we do have all of our funnels on the root domain on webflow as well uh we still use clickfunnels for low ticket and we use clickfunnels for uh order forms which is kind of funny U but we still do use those video hosting um wistia is what we used forever and then now we use a lot of Vidics so vitic is more like direct response oh I don't want this to log me in I just want to be able to show you guys baltics is going to be more of your direct response copy so the videos you see that look like this if you're using video where it has like you can opt in Prior we actually don't use any of these functionalities but we're going to see a video this just going to have a pop and it's going to basically auto play it can have a um sped up bar on the bottom so it'll like go quickly in the beginning and then stop it can have these optin um ctas that pop up bunch of different stuff uh but this is much better for direct response so we use this for all of our mobile vsls and then we are moving over to all of our desktop vsls so like if you look here you'll see um like this is wistia hey babe because we're silly and we still do that um but this is training this is Wisa I'm going to show this is vitic I'm going to show you how the worst physical pain of my so like that sticky bar like that the no open so when CTA pops they're not inside the uh on mobile have it full screen um so there's a lot of benefits to this it's actually kind of probably not smart of us to still have wistia but we are moving over um but just go to show you can do it on anything um you could email people a video and you could make $100 million so that's what we video for CRM we use HubSpot um HubSpot before when we first started this we use clothes personally I like clothes a lot I just think it's leaner and it's like so if you're just starting off um I think clothes has a really really good job you can store a lot of the data it's really good for just pipelines communication all the communication in there was tracked really easily which was nice because in HubSpot there's like differences with you have to send an email from within HubSpot for it to be tracked within HubSpot versus close uh at least in the past just like 2A sync with your entire Gmail so for all your sales reps any messaging anything that could come into support would all be in one thread which was really nice versus HubSpot kind like breaks it out but again it just kind of depends on what you're looking for um lot people use go high level for a lot of things I personally I've used it for like white labeling but when it comes to actually using it for like one specific business and just yours I am not a fan I like kind of having Silo tools that are the best at what they do not one tool that does everything does everything because you can't really be the best at any of them in my opinion um hub spot is what we use we have everything in here so we have like all of these except this I believe and this because we don't use the like website platform they have and like hosting like content marketing here and then this is for like I don't even know what this is for invoice subscriptions we don't use the payments in here we use our own setup um but I'm a huge HubSpot fan a big thing to think about here we had a conversation one time that was like how much do you think it costs us to move from clothes to HubSpot and it was had to have been like half a million dollars an opportunity cost SL like just the just the moving cost alone not the hard cost the amount of like office hours I would host with the entire team to make sure they understood it every single day sales reps the downtime and them not being able to like find deals the same way and move things and know where their pipeline is the migration what gets lost if you have 500,000 contacts and Deals or whatever you're moving over like it's it's a pain so HubSpot supposedly has like a negative churn um which is unreal and it makes sense because for us to move out of there now like they have you by the grass like or yeah by the you know so they have it uh where you like can't leave because where you going to go and even if you do then you have to export everything import everything do this big migration turn all your real- time data like everything is stored in HubSpot for us and we're going even deeper in with data and putting that as our source of truth instead of having custom databases we're likely going to use HubSpot so it's all in one place that's like in progress right now so application um and again sorry these videos are just me riffing just I mean I can in the future probably make things more professional and more you know slide decks and easy explainers this is just me saying what's working saying what we're doing saying what we learned uh going from there so application we use jot form I have love hate relationship with jot form sometimes you have to clear the cash and it breaks but we use it for all the applic for everything on the front end and the back end so the majority of what I'm going over here is just the front end so basically marketing and sales a little bit of fulfillment I'll touch on but mainly uh everything on marketing and sales side because fulfillment is going to change like if you're just doing normal info it's pretty simple stack but if you're doing like frost we're doing Fitness so there's like Fitness specific stuff that I'm not going to go through just cuz it's not as relevant for what I'm trying to build here and like who I'm trying to talk to uh that's more so I'm trying to lean and stay in the Marketing sales business Ops like that kind of side more so than like Fitness specific for running the C scale um so we use jot it's everything on the front end so sales applications then also everything on the back end and fulfillment we use it for reviews check-in forms um all that kind of stuff and then it has custom routing uh so like we have a financial qualifier finally for the first like 290,000 or something like that applications we had we didn't do that and now recently we have so we'll route people to different pages based on things it's in all of them so there's type form um there's a bunch of those but we've only ever used jot since the beginning um and then a lot of guys use custom ones so you'll see like uh some of the bigger guys I don't want to name names but they'll use custom forms they just connect back in the back end cuz same with us it just all pushes in HubSpot and then everything happens in HubSpot after the fact jot form collects it so that's what we use for app uh for booking we still use cly so here we still use cly um I like it there's some features that are missing that schedule once and some of these other ones have or you can like double book people and do stuff um and we'll see if over time we change but as of now we use this for all of the front end and all the Fulfillment side of the team as well um we still use this so we use a little bit of the workflows but mainly everything is just just to C after the booking just to do the calendar invite and then everything reminders and all that I have another video on that but um all of that mainly happens in HubSpot and then connections out of HubSpot so this is really just kind of for the booking widget phones we use lare I'm a big fan uh We've since actually used phones a lot less as of recent yes you can have my cookie checking um we used to only do phone calls so it used to be a 30- minute sales call over the phone up until a year ago maybe and then we moved over to zoom only so we still use them for reminders texts uh like back and forth communication like before um versus email obviously it's going to be a lot faster I do we are testing a blue sending platform right now that we're going to give a go I don't really want to move all the sales reps because we have 20 something 30 something depending on what time of the year uh sales reps that are in there closing and you can only send 50 contacts a day and blah blah blah but so we use alware and it direct connects to HubSpot it links really really easy it has a widget in the corner that pops up I want to show you guys like everything but I don't want to give away sensitive customer info so if I pop open HubSpot I'll be showing you people's phone numbers and messages and stuff like that and I don't feel like that's probably the best bet so um yeah so we use elare and you can do a lot of like power dialer and stuff like that meetings Zoom don't really need to go into that too much but autogenerated and connected through cly and same thing fulfillment and then a cool one that we do use is zoom Revenue accelerator I can't spell this so if you've heard of gong I think it's gong AI this I think it's this yeah so I believe yeah I believe it's this one it's gong AI gong.io one of them um but they essentially are like a conversation intelligence platform so they'll take all of your calls they'll take all of your Zoom meetings they'll take all that stuff and they have like a crazy overlay where they'll basically analyze the calls you'll know what deals one and then it'll be able to tell across all of them what the commonalities are what the script type is all that kind of stuff um so we do some of that custom with our own AI solution um but this is that's like for us it was I don't even remember 55 to 100 grand for us to do it a year with like a three-year agreement so we didn't move on it at the time just cuz the whole goal of getting these softwares is either to you know reduce time um automate things or uh save us money or change behavior and I didn't think it was going to change behavior that much at the time and then Zoom rolled out their own version of it so Zoom basically has one that's built in so obviously only works if you're using Zoom not if you're using phone calls um but for us this was cool and it only cost us like I don't know 1,000 bucks a month or something like that uh to do this so it has scorecards which is like the coolest part this right here um this is like the ratios but they have a where's the scorecard somewhere in here's a scorecard but you basically can say like did the customer uh or I'm sorry did the sales rep build report and it'll say yes or like and you can have 19 questions on the scorecard that gets Auto applied and it'll give you an answer to all of them and tell you yes or no on what scale all that kind of stuff and then also give you the reason why which is huge so it'll be like did they build rapport yes or no and it'll Mark yes and it'll say why I said that or why I think that is because the sales rep talked to him about dogs in the beginning because they were so embarking and they talked about their cute Chihuahua and they went back and forth and then she edified herself or like set the tone and got the authority in the call it's like yes so yes she built Rapport because of this which I think is really cool um it's not something that just exists out of the box in HubSpot or other that are more or less conversation talk time stuff so you know sales rep talked 80% uh the client talked 20% like that's not good right like stuff like that is yeah right there talk time Spiel filler wordss so we use that I like it and it's really good for the sales manager and just it all it also Auto syncs to HubSpot um order forms I already said that one but we use clickfunnels for that still uh I just found it easiest to segment them out and then up multiproducts across them so it is kind of conversome and and we dup them we put their name on it but we have like anop and an automation that already Auto builds them um but it works really well like it just works for what it needs to do so as we move over to HubSpot for all the source of Truth we will likely move order forms finally um processing we use stripe still to this day so we've done again don't want to pop open any dashboards but I should show it at some point um so 70 million in cash collected all through stripe and we have like .02 re uh not refund rate uh dispute rate uh refunds we have like a very liberal policy that's in basically if you're not a good fit if you're upset if you want to get out we just like give you your money back and kick you out of the group uh it just don't have time for that in the community we don't have time for that in the product we don't have time for that in the risk M like the risk of hurting our processing account like it's just not worth it for us um so I heard uh Iman have a really good video about this and he was saying he's like yeah you know we've refunded $4 million or $5 million so I pulled ours up and ours was like seven or n or something like that like we are the same way so he's still runs on stripe we still run on stripe uh you don't really run into issues KN on everything would um we do have a backup processor that's connected to clickfunnels in case there ever was an issue so we do have like a in case of fire uh setup but yeah so currently again all we process is high get payments so everything's through uh an order form and that way through a sales rep not through like direct a card so no one's going in direct purchasing uh it's end of or middle of March right now and we are launching Load Ticket that will be through website through clickfunnels and processing will still be from uh stripe but yeah so dashboarding this one I got to make sure I don't do anything crazy here so we use looker for a lot of stuff and then we use Google Sheets for a lot of stuff so looker is like amazing if I still I'm like pretty techy and I it confuses the heck out of me so I hire someone work to build these but basically just make sure you have all of your data in one clean setup in a Google sheet in a HubSpot table just somewhere that's it's a table that it's clean so date name of person what the event was cly or an application when the call was when it was booked for like all the information you want a clean table and then all you need is just ask someone to looker like I want this that it auto toggles across this range across this date uh you know for this so we use this for sales commission dashboards we use this for um Setter ones that we're building right now and that we in the past uh we use it for coaching um commission payments and stuff we do different things for retention uh any of those like live dashboards to incentivize and then all the other stuff um I like to personally build and touch and those are all in sheets so again not the most beautiful thing and just goes to show like we're still cranking on Google Sheets like no other um we use Google Sheets for cash flow management statement which is like the lifeblood it's like the it's the p&l it's the everything in everything out and then all the marketing metrics and all the Fulfillment metrics basic in one um so I use Google Sheets for all those and then sales dashboard for sales operations management uh marketing dashboard for marketing management essentially um owner level dashboard that includes everything down to like net income which is really cash flow um and then uh there's another one operations same thing kind like a mid-level one that includes a lot of those stats CS has one and something else so basically each one has their own and then they all are in sheets I have a zap that'll go pull by day 7 a.m. call it take a screenshot automatically of that dashboard on Google Sheets or looker wherever and then drop it into the relevant Channel and tag everyone so it's like you know basically do you see the numbers here's yesterday versus here's where we're at month to date uh here's where we're at quarter to date here's where at year to date and then here's in comparison to the past so last quarter versus last year versus and then green or red if it's up or down um so that's a big one for us dashboards um here how do I do this hyos uh so so we used hyros for the last like four years and we technically still have it on so we have all the parameters on and AD tracking um this becomes really important when you have multiple sources so you know you have Google you have YouTube you have or whatever you mean Google is all one but Google YouTube um Facebook Instagram meta allinone um email traffic all of that and we basically attach parameters in organic and it's a really big one for organic if you want to like put on your YouTube uh tracking link that you know where they came from on that uh it's basically Source tracking and then because we do call funnels it's 14 days on average from lead to close and then three or four from app and then you know two to three from call so it's important because they doing offline conversion is what it's called so the because they are taking the information over the phone the sales is putting in the information checking them out uh the ad platforms the tracking the whatever can't see that person checking out and know it's them because they're not actually on their computer or on their phone or whatever buying so we have some pretty cool stuff set up here where we used to use highest for a long time and then we went full custom I don't have the link for the other guys but we use um Dr UTM in current form and we're kind of testing to see how that goes so basically we have it set up so the stuff that's happening on the browser and the server match and it is capturing everything into HubSpot instead of into hyos it's doing both really but it's capturing it into hyos and it's doing it into HubSpot into our CRM and holding all those information of like the ad click when um all the stuff around you know user agent IP all the stuff we can capture um and then it is pushing those back in when they happen so for us right now we only track lead schedule submit app and purchase so all of the actual native Facebook events um we push back on those and then for purchase the big one the big difference there in my eyes at least is the custom one that we have set up allows us to set up the purchase to trigger on when they sign the terms so big thing there for terms is it's one purchase so like if you have a 10K product sometimes people are going to pay 5 K 5K sometimes people are going to pay 7200 and then put 2,800 or whatever on another card they're going to do these different split pays and sometimes hyros can get wony and if you don't have like a billing manager or someone in there running it and stripe handling everything here on custom and then also putting it into going into hyos and like combining events and doing all that then it can become an issue like that in that example it would show two different sales that came through fire back to the pixel and it would show in the in the extension and there too versus what we're doing is we set it up on the terms so the terms has double benefit because one you only have one submission per person it can then go into HubSpot pull the deal value put it back in and submit it and this is all custom set up through these guys and then the other big one is it's browser and server right because the uh client is actually going to the site filling out all the information and then submitting so that is acting as the purchase where someone can you know what I mean because it'll fire for the first and it'll fire for the second on hyros it'll only fire for one purchase with the full amount and the persons in the browser so you get the browser side and then server side we fire on our own so they match versus hyos is as close as you can get like out of the box um but takes a little bit more beef so yeah that's what we do for ad tracking right now membership portal um this is where I kind of start to lean I was leaning into fulfillment a little bit we use kajabi for the info products we used to sell and then also for all of our free products we have so anything um if you watch some of the other videos I talk about how we have at the end it's like if you stay at the end of the vssl you can get these free bonuses and these free gifts if you do that they basically go to the different Landers for different kajabi products and then they can pick which one they want so they want menopause they want alt guide or macronutrients they want these so we use kajabi for this and then the whole theme in the back end is push for Ascension to have them book a call or apply book a call and talk to someone to ascend up to the higher ticket um but I've had great success with kajabi I just don't use it for Community ever uh I don't think there even is community but um maybe there is now but Community this one is everyone has a different answer uh so for us our Target demo I think that is completely dependent on who your target demo is so for us ours is 40 to 6-y old women where are 40 to 6-y old women Facebook right so like we're obviously going to run ours in Facebook there are like fantastic ones if you're in make money online or if you're like uh uh information about trading or if you're um Fitness even kind of like can have their own buckets uh but you basically want to go where you're going to get get the highest engagement that's the whole point of it right is to make it so people are actually active in there they get value out of it out of it if you're in a recurring thing they stay for Community they feel like they're in one um so is a really good one I've heard um works with these guys on some stuff but but again it just doesn't really feel to me like the thing that my 46y old women would be want to be on um I've heard good things about Circle I really am not a fan at all but I've heard good things about Circle cuz this is like courses communities all that school obviously um if you're in this space you likely know school but these guys have everything in here feels a little bit like outdated like I just feel like communities you just have to go where people are so like if all the internet marketer guys are in here then yeah it's going to work um but like Facebook all the 46y old women are there so it works so that's what we currently use uh it's just Facebook group for that reviews we do it everywhere so trust pilot is where we collect here I'll just do this trust pilot so we do this we don't pay for this yet it's like you know5 or $600 a month which is just crazy it's like based on how many people are on your team um but we use trust pilot as like the main one just because we try and like aggregate them all in one but what we will do is run one of these every couple months and we push them here so we're basically like these are the core ones that are important to us these the core ones that rank uh and the whole goal is like if you've had a success if you've had success if you have like a positive experience we want you to share youreview because these are the number one factor in other people um seeing and actually want to join and you know get results as well um so BBB is a big one in our space uh trust pilot is just overall big one Facebook page Google review and then this is the other one I want to show you so we use testimonial. and it allows us to like standardize I think we got this from hormos I want to say Leila or hor Moi I believe um but they use this or someone use this I don't know that they use this but uh we got it from someone and uh it allows you to basically like have the questions pre-baked record the video right here have it more or less as standardized as you can and that's actually where we collected all of these from is using these video reviews is using that site having them all go into one approve them and then do that so a fun one for reviews kind of side tangent but we used uh we basically know I mean you know your cost for fulfillment so if it costs you whatever call it two grand a year for a coach or a th000 bucks a year for a coach to fill in the product um we know that if you want to give away six months it's cost you 500 bucks right and basically in hard cost in real cost if you have just like an info Community doesn't cost you anything um but for us we're like okay cool let's offer six months as a added or four months or two months or whatever you want to add and then have them submit all these things do it in a big giveaway and we're going to give it away to someone and then that was a nice one that did a nice push for us uh ovens did a really really good one in the past where he did uh basically rolled out like a 2.0 version of one of his products and was like you all get it all you have to do is submit a review first and like gated it and then every new buyer just got 2.0 and then all the people who were in The Core won it's like this is what you paid for but I will give you this for free if you submit reviews and he had like thousands of reviews over that time from the transfer so that was a really cool way to like collect reviews um and then same thing with when someone ranks NPS n or above it just routes them to there when someone just generally in general has a good feedback the coach will push them to there so yeah review collection is huge and then AI agents um we use an open AI setup right now that and like on laying chain I don't custom build this uh myself anymore um we have a senior Tech lead who's a phenomenal at this on the team but we use AI agents for a couple different pieces some of them are just like simple like AI agents but they're basically just using a app to just push information in and out uh we do use it for customized um stuff around Tech so like ingesting application information and making Uh custom uh responses there that occur so basically it'll be like without saying but like based on your application I think these are resources you'll be interested in or oh you know I can see that youve struggle with XYZ and are interested in this or you think that you are skinny fat in current state and your goal is to be you know shredded or you know like these different things um it can use that information and then tailor the conversation to them and then tailor resources it gives them uh as well as just like overall guiding them U so yeah so that those are the different AI agents pieces I can go like way in depth on this but I don't really want to go go over another Mar 25 minutes I didn't mean to um so yeah I'm going to make these videos kind of like this for now and then over time I feel like it'll probably be better if I can centralize them into one bigger piece it will just be hours and hours long um so the goal of this is just to share what we're doing and just share what has worked and what has not like AI agents we used to use one of the tools that was out of the box and use one that we paid like five grand for and then we built it in house and it cost us like 120 bucks a month to run instead of like mid thousands and we have full control and to change it whenever we want have like full customization so yeah uh I'm sure I'm missing a ton so these are just the quick ones off the top that I rattled off and wanted to share cuz I'm trying to do one of these every day and yeah if you have any other questions at all uh feel fre to drop a comment and I am more than happy to go into any detail about any of these I just need to figure out a good way to share with you guys like the actual application routing and all that stuff or how we have like custom Fields set up in the CRM like there's so much gold in some of these pieces I just don't know how to share those in a good way that will not give away like customer information or like just private information I'm more than happy to share anything I just don't want to give away someone else's stuff because that's just like not fair to them so yeah um I will talk to you guys soon and connect with me on Instagram if you want to have chat that's the easiest way to contact me so talk soon bye
