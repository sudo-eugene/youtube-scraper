## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYHxr7HMmjc

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go into the slack and communication setup that we use at our info coaching business that did 30 million in cash collected last year um so gold this channel is just to be raw tactical exactly what we are doing and have done in the past and with the hopes of helping somebody get a 2 5 10% lift in a piece of their business because when you're doing Millions a month that is needle mover in Top Line or bottom line depending um so these are the basic chunks that I'm going to use I'm going to fill these in as we go so for all team we'll start there we have three channels and again this is meant to just be raw like I don't care about the editing and the fancy and the how to make your first 10K and all that um there's a time and place for that for sure but not for us right now so all team so first thing you're going to have is our general so that's like the classic slack setup this is where we use for like announcements and um all hands meetings stuff like that um so birthday is all of th those pieces walking the walk is a huge piece for us as a fitness coaching business so for us walking the walk means anybody in the company that is walking the walk so um people do step counts they do personal training uh wins um new gym wins um nutrition wins anything like that that they're actually doing it we're a huge believer in someone who walks the walk is going to be a good coach is going to be a good sales uh team member is going to be good manager anything you have to believe in what we do which is selling that dream right and living that dream so client wins this is a fun one this is basically started as helping the sales team uh so you hear this in a lot of like sales programs that having a client's wins channel is huge and that has 5 to 10 messages a day that gets fed from CS and um the coaching team right because they'll just fill it sales team will see like oh I sold this woman two weeks ago 6 months ago wherever and they're getting success and here's it before and after here's any of that um so you can do this in any industry you can do MMO someone you know just hit a new just hit 10K mon just hit whatever um but for us it is in Fitness so these are the ones that like all of the team are in um operations and I have videos on the channel where I talk about a bit of the team setup um but for operations I just bucketed this as we have an owner's chat which is just the couple owners of the company so where we talk about like just stuff owners need to know and like tax stuff and um we have certain meetings and like monthly updates and stuff that we go through there and then we also have an automated tracker that goes into there with like a uh basically a day over- day week over week month um cash flow statement that we all see so it's just stuff that's like a little bit higher level uh goes into there now another piece of this is like I just said dashboards so I'll go through there's dashboards in a ton of these that are specific to the actual Department which is huge so the whole point of this of the SL setup in general is for communication having the right people in the right buckets and then like really again just driving behavior and streamlining it so it's not confusing but like it's the most efficient way to do it right so even as I went through this like you'll see I'll start to talk about stuff that I'm like oh maybe we could like combine these or cut these but that's where we're at so operations this is going to be our like sea level you could call it so um I have again I have other videos on the channel where I talk about this but this is essentially going to be like CMO sales manager um me uh leading Tech CS product CEO right like all the department heads and this is a weekly meeting Cadence but this is like the higher level stuff and for us these are like really strong leaders so everyone comes together in this meeting and then also in this channel to have communication that then funnels down into the rest of the company on like how they lead their departments um operations reports so all of the uh people on this operations team do a weekly report on what got done where you stuck all that um kind of like classic one to1 report and then that is brought into a weekly Cadence of uh one toone meetings that happen with CEO and then me as well and I kind of I'm like in this weird CTO coo uh role but again like only operator in terms of like uh hurting this team and making sure that uh our facilitating I guess probably way better way to say it of this team in terms of meetings and communication and all that so that's option reports um Human Resources the fun one everyone loves um so human resources for us we have 105 I believe 106 right now W2 employees and then handful of contractors that are um external or uh out of country depending whatever um out of us for us so we have a payroll channel so this is essentially the actual dollars so um this has automated things that'll go into here oh and then quick back on this so I want to try and cover what happens automated too because that's super important so the owner one like I said is a cash flow statement operations this is an operations dashboard that comes into here every day that will have uh like basically the stats from yesterday everything from new rev to units to booking count uh cost per sale everything like what drives the business in that way and then we also have an operations dashboard that we use that has specific kpis in it that each person brings to the table that comes before this meeting so I'll do another uh I'll do another video that's about the actual meeting Cadence and what happen on those but this is just the communication setup so payroll is going to be the dollars so this is going to be just a couple people that are basically HR lead and then some of the uh owners or all the owners and then some of the people in operations to see like the actual dollars going out we do a bi-weekly right now HR operations is going to be the more tactical stuff like back and forth and when there's issues and pieces that happen there so again small team on here small team on here HR Support this one's a bit wider so this is going to include the people that are also in onboarding so when there's like random issues and stuff like that they generally speaking will go back to like who is on boarding or leading the department in those pieces so this one is going to include just the uh basically owners in a couple operations this one's going to include more people that has connection to people that can submit issues or whatever comes up onboarding setup this is dedicated to HR of onboarding so that's Tech setup that's making sure they're getting the right pieces that's making sure that w9s are or I9 or whatever are like all of those pieces that they're getting access to the right platforms we use Rippling right now we use Gusto forever so making sure they have that and then terminations this is an automated one that when someone's terminated in our uh in our system then they get pushed into here and then also where like requests are done so if there's someone who is um terminated in XYZ way it'll get pushed into there we'll make sure all the processes followed through there all right now the first one that most people are interested in and the big one or one of the big ones I guess marketing so I'm going to try and rip through these as best I can but copyrighting so this was the OG marketing channel so this has been this copyrighting channel has been around for like four years so since we're doing like a million a year we've had this copyrighting Channel and uh it essentially was our marketing one but so copyrighting is literally just copywriters CMO and then uh the couple operator operations team so like me Luke um and a couple others that are in this copyrighting Channel all things copy get done in here email Cadence changing updating um any of that and then same thing with like vssl scripts will happen um ad scripts will happen page thing just all that happens in copyrighting marketing this is like the everyone is in it in marketing and we did not have this up until like months a few months ago until we just brought in a new CMO which is actually this week but uh a month ago or so we actually made this and centralized everything CU marketing was almost acting siloed and as I talk more in these videos you see like that was a clear like not good plan that we had right everyone in their own buckets and like not working and seeing all the same data so marketing is where we're going to have all of the dashboards and all that go into so marketing will get an open spots uh snapshot basically so it'll see how many bookings are on day the percentage of booked and then out 14 days so they can constantly adjust spends and make sure that they're hitting uh the you know 80% Target and then also just like an overall tracker so uh I have other videos where I go through the tracker but like cost per leag cost per app cost per booking cost per sale all those zap in uh yeah zap into here and then all things communication around marketing so now that we're doing new offers and low ticket and all that that all goes into there creative paid this is going to be like the actual creative so editing side of things for the paid and then creative for the organic um the organic one has more communication in it because it includes more people um so because it's actually creating it it is posting it more or less um and then it is putting it across all the places and then notifying uh copyrighting that they can like send emails to it so example uh new podcast or video is made gets edited they have all their coms in there about that once it is edited it is posted live so it's distributed then uh Tech team will take it and put it on the website and all the other you know relevant locations then they'll notify email uh of the copyrighting team and then they will be able to send emails to it to get that initial boost and then just add value right um so again I can have other videos that I make about like clickup boards and all that jazz but that's just this marketing feedback this is just a survey that we have somewhere built in there that gives feedback to marketing on why they came in what they saw what was most uh interesting to them to try and get uh Market feedback Talent Development this is the operations side of talent development so we have multiple brand faces that we are testing um this entire time to 70 million cash collected uh or whatever so far we've used one brand face who's the co-founder uh co-owner uh and just like Superstar so she has been the brand face up until now so now we are trying to go wider and have less uh founder risk in terms of the all the things actually so like traffic Source uh brand face product everywhere we're just trying to get wider in that with more while also staying like hyperfocused on like a couple specific offers that can crank with multiple faces okay so this is the operations of that so this will have the couple people who are in charge of managing that so for us it's like cheaper products SL people um it's going to be the CMO uh creative director all those pieces and this is where they basically talk about the operation side of it and then these are the dedicated channels that have the different um brand faces in them who are external so like other influencers basically um so in all these I'm just going to put like name one company all that cuz I don't want to dox anyone then I don't think it's fair to I wish I could share my actual slack and just show you but like there's sensitive information there so I can't share customer stuff or client name or team name like that's just not fair to them so I'm not going to do that yet until I figure out a better way or I hire an editor who can do this for me and until then I'm going to shoot looms and I'm going to record like this so uh ads company external so we have uh company that does edits this is actually kind of more so for like vsl edits but their company name starts with ads but um so these will be vssl edits and like the Crazy Design you know the the like if you see high grade direct response vssl ads these guys edit these we have an email one sometimes you have issues where when you're Mass sending your delivery and your more so your open rates just like tank so we have an external company of this guy that we basically you know they come up with a fix almost every time it's just new fix they roll it out so we just keep this so external meaning that in slack it's like an external connection so their organization is connected with ours they finally made it so you could like change your name on yours so we title them all like this so these are all the actual titles of the channel by the way so um external external external and those all sit in a bucket up here in my slack at least um that shows which one have external teams in them uh vssl company so this is a vssl writer that we have or that we basically test and that is like a performance Model guy that does that so that's going to have so all anything basically down is going to have all the leads of marketing and then the specific people relevant to it okay so email for that vssl page build same thing so this is going to have me Luke uh the CMO and then um so like basically CTO coo uh CEO CMO and then the actual person or their team right so like page build same thing here SEO same thing here we have one contractor that's outside that does this and then Tracking Company external we use a uh custom tracking setup so we use hyros we we've used hyros for like four years and we still have it on but we don't have feeding the pixel we have a complete custom setup for tracking um that is needs to have communication around it because when you change something you update this you need to make sure all that's in there so I can do another long video on that because we have a very custom setup for that and I'm sure they would love if we shared that so Tech next piece Tech is going to have the uh the senior Tech lead myself and then again main operators main operations people so Tech admin is the main channel that we will talk about just overarching things so a lot of times it's just me and the uh senior Tech League going back and forth communicating on things um tech support this is an internal one um that is basically which is can be confusing with the internal support So tech support itself basically is like all the support tickets so we have a a tech ticket that launches and goes into these different buckets and then they can um you can basically say like which part of the company they're having an issue with they can outline it they can Loom and then they submit a ticket because it was getting crazy and like customer support and all these other ways of asking everything from like an email reset to like a client level thing so we have tech support here that is a basically ticket submitting that auto occurs uh internal support this is we have a tech support VA that is has been with the company for like four and a half years absolutely crushes but she basically logs everything she's doing um cuz she does like she's really really good at Sops so she will come in and do every day it'll be all these 19 things that we can't automate and every time we post a video it'll be do this and we'll upload a training it'll get put in this back office and like all that kind of stuff um so she does all that and logs it in this internal support and then also you can go to ask her specific things in here it's basically her Channel um so we'll just go in there and just be where is she internal support versus like customer support she will support everyone on the team um SMS company we have an external we're testing blue send right now this is an example of another external company uh that we are in so it'll be just be again same people it'll be me it'll be senior Tech lead it'll be CEO and uh yeah app design company this is for when we were doing uh design for the Fulfillment for a product that's inside fulfillment so just a design company and then this is when we did the website overhaul we have these guys and they're also on call SL like a ticketing system so when we have updates and things that we need we just put it in there they create a ticket and it's managed through okay sales I hope this is super dry and fun because that's how it's supposed to be um sales sales operations is the uh basically leadership of them so that's going to be your sales manager it's going to be your sales uh ops manager or like a coordinator Setter manager and then all the right sea level right so all things dashboards pop into here for sales team of a management perspective okay so you have sales team which has like the entire actual sales team in it and they get dashboards that are specific to to their commissions and their performance production all that operations is going to get the overall manager level one so they're going to get what was overall this overall that right and Beyond sales hot leads this is a fun one this is basically if people submit it's B it's just it's hot leads simply put so anytime there's low ticket buyer it zaps into there anytime there is a custom time request zaps into there anytime a call is going over pushes into there anytime someone has some crazy intent pushes into there and they claim them comment on them and then uh take them offline or in the HubSpot more so so sales team that's just everyone like I said um this is the one that's going to have the most Communications in here these are notification channels okay so applications pushes every time we have a new application opportunities every time we have a new uh booking opportunities direct every time a closer has a direct booking so when they use their booking link to get like to a reschedule or if they're mining the CRM because they a noow or whatever um they these will fire into here new clients this is every time uh new purchase is made so what actually happens is the deal is marked as one inside HubSpot it's actually marked as sales approval in HubSpot they push into here and then the leaders of sales the ops manager and the uh actual sales manager uh will approve them and then they push into new clients right so just make sure that no one messed anything up the date the fields are all filled out correctly and all of that um so this is like the hype up channel so this one's going to have just yeah all the hype um cohort onboarding we onboard different cohort ports in like different buckets so when they overlap is when we start to use one two and three which we've done a lot over the last over 2024 we did this a lot where every two weeks we basically had them but they were still like dripping out of the other one so instead of just putting them all in one bucket we do cohorts right now on the Cadence we're at we only use one and then two and three basically just sit there idle until we're at a point where we have to uh bucket them and this is going to be all things on boarding all questions all what cuz if you're dropping questions in your brand new sales rep and there's five of them and they're asking all these questions in sales team or sales team questions like it's it gets brutal so we have like dedicated onboarding team that does this um like a hype officer that's in there that knows all the systems all the uh all the everything sales reports they do an end of week report for us and then they have their own trackers and all that um but just in terms of like comms they fill out a report that's a job form that then zaps into here so they're all in one place and then sales team questions this is any technical question there's a couple coaches in here and then there's also uh all the sales team and so it's basically like some more technical questions or something maybe a sales rep is not going to know not new onboarding not know but like just things that are kind of crazy in different directions and then same thing if like an order form's not working or if something's bugging like and they're on the on a call like this is their go-to spot that they'll ask and try and get support from operations Tech whatever uh or coach so Setters this is new to us so I'm going to kind of combine these but Setters so you're going to have Setter team which is same thing a sales team it's just all your Setters and management of that Setter application so these are all brand new so where we're at currently is like we've run this kind of in the past but it's never worked for us so we haven't had a Setter team in the last like two years um so we didn't use Setters at all to do any of these numbers um and now we're trying to again into the future so Setter team and then Setter application so Setter application is going to be basically someone who applies but doesn't book after like 3 minutes and then it's going to zap into there bum they can dial and go from there we have ai on this already but we're going to try and like overlap and do both of them at the same time and see how that goes so this will be like a basically like a hot leads Channel and then we will also see if this channel eventually it likely is just going to move over to cters completely which will be good so because then these guys can just focus on closing and not on hot leads and bouncing back and forth and Mining the CRM and all that because the setter still do that um set end of day they do end of days uh our manager wants to push for that so he will doing end of days instead of end of weeks Mand help this is our AI bot that I was talking about so when it Flags or sees any sentiment inside there that is like maybe a human needs to step in they push into here so it's another like hot lead basically Channel when the AI can does not want to respond uh they can claim them here and then triage team and triage operations so triage operations is going to be so we call Triage call confirmation or we call it triage but a lot of people call it call call confirmation this is the team that directly dials all of the bookings right after they're done right after they've booked okay so it's like instant hey just want to confirm that it's this time zone that you know it's a zoom call all that so we use an offshore team right now actually um that is 20 hours or I think yeah 20 hours a day s days a week so the operations is us with just their uh project manager or like team lead and then this is the actual team of the of the women that are actually making the dials um and we there's what three or four in there customer success I hope this is thrilling to everyone cuz it is to me um customer succcess this is like lifeblood of the company these are your di hards they are like the glue that keeps us all together um great great team here Community Management this is just uh for the actual communities it so we use Facebook as our communities because our Target markets 40 to 60y year old women um so it fits so Community Management any comms around that kind of stuff CS escalations so we call them escalations and then you have like escalations track of basically someone wanting refunds someone upset someone whatever and then you have refunds from there and then it's a percentage of escalation to refund and that we track on a week over week basis uh and they Crush these so like last week we had whatever 10 escalations on however many 4,000 clients or something like that and zero refunds so these are women that like wanted to refund need to talk to someone all that and then CS de escalated them all so this basically coms around that customer support this is I this needs to almost be up here I think it actually probably is should be up there Co but I'll just leave it but customer support this is the like or did I just move it on there it is um customer support this is like all company customer support anything that involves a client goes in like goes into here so billing requests forms uh someone can get into something login so like Tech and billing manage this just nonstop um we try and keep the tech support to internal Tech issues anything that ever touches a customer directly is going to be in here okay um so this is like this is a really big channel for us enrollment feedback so these are one toone uh surveys and anytime we get feedback or any of this stuff gets automated and sent into these okay so same thing with like set team sales team like those get all those dashboards I was saying any of like the main Hub of those will get dashboards that can then drive Behavior incentivize and nbm uh enrollment enrollment feedback is the feedback forms that happen after the Cs team does the onboarding call because for us it is a close then they schedule in with an onboarding specialist which is a CS rep and then they basically make sure they have all their Tech Systems they have all their docs they're excited all things and then they pass them off and assign them to a coach because we have 70 coaches so it'll like it depends on availability and open and all that um so enrollment feedback is uh feedback on how that call went that the customer fills out failed payments this is for a billing it's just if someone's auto pay um in one of the pay plans or whatever breaks this used to be way more relevant when we were selling a ton of pay plans and a ton of that uh not as relevant now but still retention management this is brand new we are rolling out a retention team that has that is uh top sales reps that then were pod managers uh or pod leaders so they would had basically 10 to 15 sales reps under them because we had up to 30 sales reps at one point uh last year and they now have moved over to retention so they're completely out of Front End Sales and now there's an entire system and flow in the back end that will basically create pipelines for them of women who are going to clients who are going to renew in 60 days and then book calls with them go through how their experience has been get a bunch of valuable feedback back as well as position to then renew them into the next year cuz that's where a bunch of the money is made um I have another video where I go over this but it's like 80% margins on the back end or the renewal more so um than it is on the front so this is comms all around that and specific to that support SMS we have the main lines of the company that send out blast and are just like all over everything so that comes into here which is also managed by the um the customer success like lead who does all the email management as well as all these SMS management merchandise external we use an external company to do like 3pl and all the stuff for all the swag that we have uh we just have like a very lean shop if people do want swag is like the ninth time we've tried it we finally found a company external that does really good and just does everything for us and it's high quality so we have one of these external um supplement Ops and support So we had a testing kit that we used for like the entire last year that everyone got on purchase and then basically does a call with them and then talks to them if they want supplements and then we get commissions and it was like a attempt to increase LTV and increase customer experience and like results it didn't really go great I'm GNA be honest we're paying for all the kits the backed out math was like I don't want to tell you how bad it was like just let's just say we lost like 96% of the money in terms of what we got back but and do the math on what you think how many commas there are um but supplement Ops is the like basically team that manages it so on their side and on our side and then support is both on our side and their side who does the actual like this person didn't get a kit this person is trying to schedule a call that back and forth so both on our side and like the Cs like actual representative who's talking to the person in email and then on their side of that same thing and then Ops the people who we talking about like we need different commission percentages and we need that right and then last piece coaching so coaching for us means fulfillment so info guys and gals um for us we're coaching so we have 70 coaches um or 65 or something in that range right now um that actually fulfill on the product so one toone coaching so check-ins is a part of our fulfillment process so we have like a weekly we have these different cadences of check-ins where the clients are submitting and they're submitting them into here and they also have some feedback in them um this is going to be all your coaches and then all of operations of coaches um coaches here is the same thing as like you know sales team it's all coaches so this is all announcements this is any you know fun and just back and forth um but those are all in there questions this is going to act the same way as a sales team question um so kind of for onboarding but mainly for like once you're in a position or like some client has an interesting request or someone's vegan or someone has XYZ you know disease or something like has anyone else dealt with this like a lot of that questions side of things will happen in there and then Tech also in there to help same thing with the onboarding as sales so we will do them cohorts when we're like ramping ramping fast when we get under I believe the number is 250 to 300 open spots uh that's when we start like the real hiring aggressive Cadence because sales when they're crushing is doing 400 plus units and then beyond and our next we of growth is the plan um so then we start hiring to make sure that the availability is there and then these are the same things so just onboarding cohorts if they overlap we use multiple and in the past we've scaled up to at least three on boarding in different cadences so like week over week they're basically starting and overflowing on the two to four week uh onboarding flow exit surveys super valuable feedback because for us in Fitness it's like if you help them get the result they leave and if you don't help them get the result they leave so uh it's kind of interesting just to gather all the information and see I mean definitely what they feel about the coach and the product and the overall stuff but then like reasons they're leaving um because then maybe we can better tune the retention team onto getting them to stay because of community and personalization or community and accountability but they don't need to know this and this because they learned it over the last year right so super uh valuable valuable for us feedback so that's throughout the process feedback is throughout the process exits on the way out so feedback these constantly are firing off so there's a month one there's a six-month one there's a random one that goes out and these are just constantly just getting feedback from like how do you feel about this like where how do you feel like we're doing where can we approve where can we whatever and then these are also what route when over nine I believe nine NPS score these route to the reviews and then gather reviews and then weekly reports same thing as uh all these other weekly reports they do a weekly update of basically what happened what they're working on what's good anything that came up or not um and yeah so that's a general gist so hopefully this wasn't too dry uh I tried to make it a little cleaner instead of just having these all pre-written on here so uh that you guys would just see everything and then just bounce uh but hopefully you get some value out of these and you know people are telling me I need to do editing and need editors and mics and all that I did get a mic because audio is important so mic's on the way but the uh editing and making them all flashy and doing that I don't know how I feel about that it's not really my goal of this to have hundreds of thousands views necessar like on these type of videos uh more so just have the right people 10 people people whatever in that range of people that are actually in the weeds actually doing it actually building so that's all I got uh drop a comment find me on Instagram do anything let me know what you want to see and I can just crank out these videos whenever so let me know
