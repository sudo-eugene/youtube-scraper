In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the profit math behind three different funnels. And by the end of this video, you're going to understand which one of these funnels to implement in your business to make the most amount of profit. I'm going to start by walking through each one of these funnels and how they work. And then we're going to deep dive into the math on what it's going to cost you to acquire a customer through each one of the funnels. And then if you stick around to the end, we're going to talk about how you can two, five, even 10x the profit through these funnels. All right. Now, last year we did 30 million in cash collected through our info coaching business. We've done 71 now actually 72 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So let's get into it. So funnel number one, I'll try and be quick on these, is a VSSL opt-in funnel. This is the classic send someone to a page to claim a free training. They put in their name and email, sometimes phone number. They are then redirected over to a VSSL page, which is the training. They watch the VSSL and it pushes them to apply. They fill out an application to work with you, to join your program, to whatever, and then uh after they apply or push to book a call. Once they book a call, land on a success page that is pre-objection block framing, watch this video before your call, talk to a closer, and then become a client. Okay? And we're going to break down the math and the percents of how the funnel drops off over here after this. Okay? Now, the DTA funnel is a direct to application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL, but essentially this page is a headline, a VSSL, an application, and sometimes some testimonials. And the idea of this is they don't have to opt in. So all of the traffic makes it there. On on something like this, you may have like a 20% opt-in rate on the lead uh to uh VSSL. And here you would have 100% of the people making it to this page. Now, after someone applies, they make it through the exact same back-end part of this funnel where they book a call. After they apply, they land on a success page, same framing, all of that. Then they talk to a closer and become a client. Okay? And then this last one in red down here is a low ticket funnel. And for this we're going to use a two-step checkout. So you are going to send them to a sales page, VSSL, headline, all the copy selling the program talk or the uh low ticket item. Could be a program, could be a community, a course. Selling them on the idea of it. They put in their name and email to check out brings them to an actual checkout page. So you capture them as a lead there. Then on the checkout page, they are going to purchase the actual product. Now, this is in our case an ascension optimized funnel, not an AOV. So, instead of having uh one-time offers that would be upsells for $99, $200, whatever. Ours is just pushing them to book a call, like a starter call. And that is with a setter. So, they book into the call with a setter. Then, the setter talks to them, qualifies them, sees if they're a good fit, and then pushes them, sets them with a closer, and then the closer talks to them, and they become a client. All right? And then we're going to talk about this BE1R and BE2 in here in the profit section. All right? So hopefully that was a good gist of what's happening here. Now in an effort to make this as easy as possible while sharing both of these, we are going to talk the VSSL optin funnel first. So quick math on this. Let's say it costs you $30 to get a lead. Oops, why didn't that work? $30 to get a lead. Of those leads, we're going to say that 20% of those are going to become applications. Okay. So, one in every five is going to apply that opted in. All right. Now, from there, we're going to say 50% of them that apply book a call. And then from there, we're going to say 12% of them become clients. So, in this situation, it would cost you $2,500 to acquire a customer. Now, down here, we're going to talk into cash collected and what that means and the math behind it, but this is just the math behind the funnel. All right. Now, let's say your lead cost was $15 and everything else remained the same. Now, that might not always be true. All of these are variable. All of these could change because you could get $5 leads, but they could be the worst quality and they would not convert at the other steps in the same way. But, we're going to just use this as an example. Let's say it was a $15 lead cost. Let's say it was 30% of them applied and 50% of them booked and 12% of those bookings closed. $833 uh customer acquisition cost. Okay. Now, bring these back to where I had them in pocket. Oops. Sorry. What was I say? 20 50 12, right? So, your 2500. Now, the other thing to note when I say 12% here, people are like, "Oh, it's a 20% 12% close rate." And it's not a 12% close rate. This is from booking to client. So, this includes show rate and close rate in in one. So, industry standard, let's call it 50%. which would mean this is a 24% live call show rate or close rate. Okay, so just a blended metric that we always use that's like sal we call it sales per booking but sales per all booking. So it's like all of these all of these and that's cancels no shows reschedules and then all only all client units. Okay. Now in a DTA funnel we're going to assume it's going to cost you $7500 7500 $75 to get an application. Now how many of these applications turn into bookings? We're going to say the same amount. So, in this model right here alone, you're cutting your costs in half, right? Let's just say this is an example. Now, how many of those bookings close and turn into clients? We're going to say 5%. So, it's actually going to cost you more in this example. Now, why am I saying that? And these are all example numbers, but you know, relatively in the right direction. People absolutely nail this. And some people have this as the example. So, like when we're testing right now, this is pretty similar to what ours looks like, which is terrible. So, it's going to cost you $75 to get an uh application here instead of 150 because it is the first thing. It's directly there. It is non-gated and they can easily do it. There's very little friction. Now, once they do that, we're going to say 50% book. It might even be less on this because someone applies and if the framing is not correct, they're like, "Oh, wait. Why do I have to book a call now? Like, I just want to fill out this application and see what this was all about." So, maybe this is even lower. Now 5% and why this is the case the stats show and it makes sense why because there is less friction there is less consumption they are not further in like an actual journey with you in time sake and because it is so easy for them to apply the show rate tanks. So normally if you have a 50 or 60% show rate out of the box when testing this say it's half say it's 30% 40% that show and then once they even do show because there was not as much friction because they've not consumed as much information they are less likely to close. So the blended amount of this we're just going to say is a 5% sales per booking which makes this bloody $3,000 to acquire a customer. Now there are people that crush this absolutely crush this and with the most qualified thing ever. What you can do is add qualification. Have it just a really good VSSL. Have it super targeted. So it's like only do this if you make over 200 grand. Only do this if you do that. Like you can do that in both the VSSL, the headline and the application. You can just DQ people if they don't have enough assets, if they don't have enough uh income, if they don't have, you know, whatever. If they're not interested, like you can do so many things. So you could make this $200 application, which sounds crazy, or whatever. Actually, even higher. Let's go like 300. You could have a $300 application that comes through here, right? In this, but of this, 80% are going to book. And like guys like Jeremy Hanes are like, "Oh yeah, just put them in one. Put the booking in the app." I like the idea of having like two steps so you can capture the other people on the other side because I think you'll get more throughput. Not tested. He's probably right on this. But he puts the booking widget inside there. So it's actually 100% on his. And then once you get them on the phone, because you qualified them so hard and you pre-framed this so hard, you can continue to get your 12% roughly or even let's go even higher. Let's say it's uh 15 to 20%. And you then only have a $2,000 CPA. Also, if my video is glitching, it's because you don't subscribe. Um so $2,000 CPA on this because you qualified, right? And that's the that's the thing overarching of all of this. The economics are the economics. like it is what it is. But like if you have the right messaging, you have the right framing, you have the right qualifi qualifiers, and you have, you know, pretty solid like okay media buying, like this math works, right? So that's the gist. Now, low tickets and then we'll get into the fun part down here, which is the gross profit and the backend cash collection and the recurring and all the jazz. So what's it going to cost you to get a low ticket lead? Let's say, no, let's be real, more realistic. Let's say it's $50 to do that. Of that $50, so it's going to cost you $50 to run ads to a page and get someone to fill in their name and email to begin to check out. Now, the framing on this is very much so like you're you're buying right now. So, it comes out to 55 or to 50. 55% of those good-ish number rough could be 60, could be 40. Let's say 55. So, it cost you $91 to acquire a customer. Now, why I had this net net ad cost on here is because these are absolute. It's net ad cost is the same as ad cost. Net ad cost. This model is different because you collect cash early in the funnel. So, it did cost you $91 to get a purchase, right? That's what you got here. But you made in this example, $37. So, the net is actually, and I just uh lit this green because cash was collected. Um, it's still negative. You still lost money. Uh, but in this model, it cost you $54 net. So now you spent 91, you made 37, and now in this stage in the funnel, you're only down 54 bucks. Okay? So on this next section, we're going to say that 60% of the people book with a setter. And this is where you start to see the math get different. $152 is what it would have cost to direct if you didn't collect cash. But really, it only cost you 90 to get somebody on the phone with a setter or to technically get a setter booking. This does not include show rates and all that, but $90 is what it costs. Now, how many of those then make it over to a closer? We're going to say 50%. Kind of high, but we're just going to say it in this example. So, that's going to cost you $300 direct normal, which you're like, "Oh, wow. It's the same as these ones basically." But really, it's 180. Now, this is the crazy number. These are going to convert way higher. Way higher because not only are they a buyer, not only did they talk to a setter, but they are like the consumption levels, like the the framing that they've gotten, the touch points they've gotten is so much higher. And this is like actual stats. So for us, we're getting over 80% show rates now or right right at 80 actually. Don't want to say over at right at 80. And the close rate is also dramatically higher. So we're getting higher shows and higher closes. And because the economics are working right now, this is kind of like a throttle point that we're at because let's say this is $100, like this math breaks. So just on a CPA basis. Now you could say oh on this if you had a higher cost here or the product was instead of 37 it was 97 but then you dropped the other percentages or if you added stuff post purchase which doesn't affect front-end conversion rates but we're trying to optimize for calls so these would break these percents. So there are little things like order bumps in here just better media buying just better creative split tests on page design to get one or two% lifts. So that's one of the things working on but this math is crazy. Okay so those are the three different funnels. Now, this is just the math. And before I get into this, which is like the fun part, this is just the math, okay? And you could play with these in any which way. You could have 30% up here. You could have what we used to have, which was, you know, sub $20 leads. You could have a 55, which we've easily had. We've had like 60. And you could have this at 15. And you could be have $800 cost per purchase just on a VSSL funnel. They're warm. They're consumed. You have a ton of data because you have all these emails, you have all these things. This one you can rip off the RIP and go a little faster and get people on the phone quicker because they don't have to go through all these steps, not as much setup. And this one is, in my opinion, just harder to set up because there's just like you have to have a product that's actually good to fulfill. You have to have like there's just so many different things in here that make this work. But I do know people who test this to like test a market in a niche cuz it's like if people will buy it, then they know. I like talking to people on the phone. I think this one or this is the easiest version of launch. This one is just kind of like tried and true if you can make it work. But like I'm trying to crack this and we still haven't even cracked this. We just started it. Um this is the tried and true. We did 70 million through and this is the new new now that we have like a brand built up and like assets and all the stuff that we can sell and like a full team. The economics al make the most sense on this and it's also a volume play because you're getting hundreds of purchases of this that then may convert later and are buyers in your system. So quick math but we're going to use this one now for the portions below. All right. So, Horoszi stolen word, phrase, whatever, lifetime gross profit. So, what actually matters here and to go back to our profit math behind this, this is just what it costs to acquire a customer. Okay. Now, what happens after you acquire the customer? And this is just what it costs to acquire a customer in ads. Okay. Now, let's say, and in the model up here, I'm going to use 6,500. So, it cost you $6,500 to acquire a customer. I'm sorry. It cost you 65. You cash collected $6,500. And in this case, it cost you, we're just going to pull this one over here from the low ticket funnel. It cost you a little under $1,000. Now, a sales team, what does a sales team normally make? We're going to use these as percents. A sales team is going to make 15% when you include setters, sales management, all that. Maybe even higher. Um, like I've seen this as high as like 20%. Um, so it depends on your model, but that's a closer, that's a setter, that's setter manager, that's closer manager. Fulfillment you want to keep under 20% as well. So your cost to a coach, your cost whatever. And this is I'm going to get into these on like renewals and backends and other things, but 20% on this as well. So your gross profit of your one unit backend is $2,900. So, you paid your uh the ad bill, you paid your sales team and sales management, and you paid the fulfillment team to do the actual to like fulfill on the service. Now, that'll leave you at 44%. Where this is not good is when this number is your CPA. When it's 30, when it's 20, when it's 55, and when it's 12, and you have wait 30, 20, 55. Just do this for example. When this number is this, which has happened, let's just say, uh, and your, uh, acquisition explodes, your sales team still still makes the same amount, your fulfillment still the same cost. You're making 7.55%, which is a 0.14 multiple of lifetime gross profit, 0.14, because you are in profit making, right? Where's my math coming from? Yeah, you're making $491 in profit on this LT LTGP to CAC ratio, right? So, it cost you 64 $3,400 to make 491. Now, let's go back to where it's 998. Now, you're making 2.91x because it cost you $998 to make 2900. All right. And this math right here, just so we're clear, is the cash collected minus what it costs ad costs, sales team, and the fulfillment. Now, the low lifetime gross profit is not really lifetime in this. It's one time. So, you've been paid one time. Now, this is what happens in as you go deeper into this. Somebody, what just happened was somebody came into your funnel and we got them all the way to become a purchaser. This is them buying their first high ticket thing and they may have bought this low ticket in this example. So, they came in, bought a low ticket, offset it, and then it cost you $1,000 net in ads to get them to become a back-end high ticket purchaser. Okay? So, you made $6,500 on that, but really it cost you those ads, and then it cost you $1,300 for your sales team, $1,300 for your fulfillment. Okay? Gross profit 44%. Beautiful. And again, what this is very likely to be, let's say, is like 2500. So, you made 20% on the front end, which is not so good. Now, here's where it gets all lifetime value, and people talk about this. Now, let's say you just have this exact same thing as a renewal. Okay? So, someone stays with you for a year. Let's say this our six-month program or a year or whatever. It cost you or I'm sorry, they then repurchase the same thing. They're like, I'm on another year. They pay you another $6,500. Okay? You have no ads. you have a let's say renewal team that helps them renew where you maybe pay 5% 10% maybe let's just say 10 just so we can be aggressive but your fulfillment stays the same. Your gross profit on your renewal is a 70% margin. You make $4,500 versus the first year where you made $20 or 20%. Okay? So you make 70% versus 20. You make 4500 versus 1400. Okay? because you have no ad costs and because your sales portion, which you may not even have a renewal team, they might just renew and you make even more money. Okay, that is the beauty of this whole lifetime value reselling to customers, keeping them longer, is because now you just took what was a 0.5 and instead now on your $2,500 ad cost initially, you are now making a 2.6 multiple on that number. Okay? And then if we bring this back to where it actually was in this model, I believe that was the negative. I think I have to negative my negative. You went from 2.9 to 8. Okay. See what I'm getting at here on the profit math. So, how you acquire them is how you set the baseline for what it costs to. Like, you want this as low as possible. If it's going to cost you 3,400, it's going to cost you 2K, and it's going to cost you a,000, opt for the,000. But understand that sometimes you need to run multiple of these to kind of like have them feed each other. But on the beginning you made 2.9 and after just one renewal and this and like people do this in six month or threemonth increments. Like I've literally seen people be like, "Oh yeah, our first program is a 90-day thing. It's 6,500 bucks. You get you in blah blah blah." They get you in, they still make money. Some people even go in the negative here to do this and then they renew them after those 90 days or 6 months and they're like, "Okay, cool. So now like the next 6 months or 9 months is going to be 6,500 bucks." They pay a full fulfillment team that's under 20%. So even lower than this maybe and they have no retention team and they have no ad cost because they already paid the ad cost, right? And the fulfillment then uh I'm sorry then the gross profit on that with that is then 5,000. So they make 80% margin on that. Okay, now this is where it gets different. This is basically saying, okay, cool. They're just renewing. Now let's say you have a completely back-end offer, too. And this is kind of something we're building right now on this. Let's say it's a $3,600 product or a what's the half of that? Oops. Let's say it's 3250. That's half, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's half. Let's say it's 3250, but your service offering is different. So again, we're going to say 10% renewal team, but your fulfillment on this instead of 20% because it's a onetoone service or something like that where it costs that much to fill, it's like 3%. So think about you keep them give them access to stay in the community. They get your app. They get some software. They get something right that cost you like nothing. Your margin on the back end then goes to 87% on this but at a lower dollar value. But your cost in time and money to fulfill is so much lighter that you could have 900 people in here without any operational like overhead or like time spent. And then so this example is someone comes in, they buy low ticket cost $998 and then I'm sorry right here then net to then get them in a backend purchase of $6,500 acquired you made $2,900 contribution to overhead. This is not profit profit because you have ops teams and HR and other stuff that like marketing team that you have to pay like all these things. This is gross profit not profit bottom line bottom line profit. Okay. So 2,900 here. Then they decide to sign on for the next extension of like basically the same program, but like the continuation of that. So it's still going to cost you 20% in fulfillment, but you already paid your ads and you don't have a retention team. Let's say you do have a retention team because it's kind of likely you're going to have a retention team. Okay? You then made $4,500. So these two combined, the gross profit you made on the first one and the gross profit you made on the second one, in comparison to the ad spend that was only onetime ad spend, you're now at 7.4x. Okay. Now, they then want to stay after this first year or second year, but they're like, I don't really need uh onetoone attention or this like crazy thing, but like I want to stay for the community. I want to stay in the group. I want to stay whatever. You keep them at a lower rate that costs you basically nothing to keep them in there. It's essentially just access or using tools that you already pay for. Uh maybe, you know, a one to many situation with a coach, something in that way. Very little fulfillment. You pay renewal team, but you might not. You make 2,800 bucks on that, which in addition to these comes out to 10 G's on that same 1,000. So your lifetime value, lifetime gross profit to advertising cost or two customer acquisition cost is now over 10. So that is how you get to 10x on your acquisition cost both by understanding your acquisition methods and how to get that CPA down and then how to drive the gross profit and actually understand it. So I hope that was helpful. um felt like I went in circles a little bit, but I hope it was very helpful for you to change some things in your business. And uh yeah, hit me on X or Instagram. Um I'm making all these videos just to try and find some talent, some opportunities to network with some cool people. So if you're cool people, let's network. And quick thing, daily update. I've made videos like this for 47 days in a row. Uh and I put them here on this URL with different categories breakdown when I posted them. Um the main idea behind them and linked out. So yesterday in our info biz we did 60 no 35gs bad day Sunday very low booking and it was the start of a new pay period so people aren't as jazzed to sell because it's just a fresh commission thing versus trying to make the push which was a massive day on Saturday prior um or not massive but it was a massive day for the sales reps because they were all hitting bonuses because they were like getting over the edge. Not a massive day for us. So we're working. We're trying to sales manager. That's our current um crux of this is this portion right here, this closer call percentage. But I'm just going to over so I'm going to cut this here. Appreciate you guys. Hopefully this was valuable. Talk soon.
