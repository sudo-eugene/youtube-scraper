# How Brook Hiddink is Scaling to $5M/mo... | EP70
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6tHVSDg20U

Love it. All right, guys. We've been chopping it up already, but today's video we have Brooke. You guys have seen his ads. I know you've seen his ads. He absolutely crushes. Keep these light. Today's day 70 in a row of making videos where Before I was spewing, now I'm talking to cool people now that I met from spewing. So, kick it off. Who are you? What's the quicklong elevator? Yeah. Uh Hiddings. So, I'm from born and raised in Canada. Um growing up, played a lot of hockey. ended up going to law school after hockey. Did the whole law school thing. I ended up dropping out of my third year to do like a high ticket drop shipping store. So, literally like three months before graduation, much to my parents dismay, I dropped out. Um, by that point, I was making more. When I dropped it, I was making more from my e-commerce store than I was going to make as a lawyer. So, I had a strong case. So, dropped out. Um, ran that store for the next 18 months. I think between 18 months and two years after I started, everything was going very well. Um, I joined essentially a program to start posting content online just because I didn't have any social media at all. Like I had an Instagram of like two posts on it. So started um posting a bit about like what I was doing. Had a bunch of people DM me and that essentially led to indirectly like it wasn't intentional at the time. I started doing one-on-one consulting with people for e-commerce and then that kind of led into launching the offer which we launched in late 2022 and which is like a high ticket e-commerce coaching offer and we've been running that ever since and it's been pretty consistent growth since then. So it's coming up on two and a half years now we've had that. Nice. And you're and you said Dubai. Uh Dubai now. Yeah Dubai. So moved to Dubai in Yeah. Would have been right around when we launched the coaching offer. So late 2022. I actually just when I moved to Dubai I just came with a carry-on bag like three pairs of pants, couple shirts and a carry-on bag. And I thought like you know what I'll try it. Worst case I don't like it. Came and really really liked it actually. So I didn't really know what to expect but really liked it and then just have never really left since. So, obviously I leave in the summer, but call it home now. Yeah. Very cool. That's what I did with Puerto Rico. I have a picture of me and it's literally or one of my buddies dropped me off at the airport and I have uh the monitor, my laptop monitor or like laptop and monitor in one and then a duffel bag that had like same thing like six t-shirts and you know, four pairs of shorts. Yeah, it's hilarious. Okay, so the ecom business when it starts, so what is that? What do those even look like? I mean, I see your ads again. I know everyone sees your ads. So, it's it's high ticket e-commerce, but is it like branded? Is it one niche? Are they multi-niche? Like what do most people do with this? Or what was yours, I guess? Yeah. So, mine was very broad. So, essentially like I had a homegoods store. That was the first store I launched. Um where essentially like what you're doing is you're technically like drop shipping is just a fulfillment model, right? Like you don't have your products in your own warehouse. So rather than going to like AliExpress or Alibaba or any of these like Spocket, whatever the other ones are, you call like US brands. So, like let's say if if you go to Home Depot, there might be like 10 grill or barbecue brands there. So, you can essentially just call those brands up and say, "Hey, I want to list your products on my website. I'm not going to stock inventory, but I'll run ads and bring you sales." So, essentially, they don't have any risk. Like, the worst case scenario is is if you shut down your store and you had like outstanding orders, like that's really the only risk to these brands. So, as long as you seem somewhat legit, you can give them the good value proposition, seem like you know what you're talking about, they'll let you list their products in your store, you can run ads to them, and then they usually give you between like 20 and 50% profit margins depending on the brand. So, a lot of the stores that do well, like I think that was one of the mistakes I made is um early on I had just like a very broad store, but a lot of the ones that do the best are like very niche, like golf or cooking or um like saunas do very well. That was my best product with sauna. I find that the more niche you are, the stronger brand you can have and then that the the brand actually allows you to do really well with SEO gives you more longevity and a lot of the ones that ends up like end up exiting and building enterprise value are like that a little bit more narrow. Yeah. So when how do you do it though where aren't those branded products already as an example? So like aren't you like you're a brand So you're a brand of like a home good whatever on top of then these other brands. So like why are they not going direct to those? Yeah. Yeah. So, it's it's like it's very similar to like Walmart. Like Walmart is a brand, but you don't buy Walmart products really, right? Or same with Home Depot. So, it's like that. But the the reason that like a lot of these brands don't understand online marketing at all. So, like like for example, if I was to start my own grill brand today and I didn't know what I was doing with marketing. If I just give my products to like 50 of these online online retailers, they'll just like bring me sales without me really having to spend a dollar on ads. Got it. I think it's just like a distribution play. Yeah, it's exactly the distribution play. It's like an Yeah, an affiliate or whatever. A lead flow. Yeah, that's interesting. Okay. So, and then so now your business model on top of that. So, you ran that for x amount of time, crushed it, made your, you know, your millions and then went into info of teaching it and then there's a software play like what's the offer stack of what you currently run for your biz now. Yeah. So, it's a essentially there's the easiest way to explain it is there's one offer with different level levels of access. So, we have like course only, group coaching and community, one-on-one coaching, hybrid done for you, and done for you. So, it starts at like 500, goes all the way to like 25K. So, we have all the different levels within that one offer. And then, yeah, I'm not sure if you a couple years ago, did you read like Lynchpin when it came out from Russell Brunson? Absolutely. Yeah, I read that. Made a lot of sense to me. So, that's what led to us actually creating our software. Um, software does well, like it does like six figures a month. Um, don't really think about it. But the problem, the mistake I made with that software was the only customers are people who come through our offer. So it never had like something like a high ro where it could expand beyond the program. But it's still it's a nice income stream, but it's not ever going to be like a big exit value or enterprise play. You know what I mean? Yeah. No, no, for sure. Yeah. We talk about that with like an example for us is supplements of that. It's like you can either build supplements that are, you know, your protein, you're this, you're that, you know, for your customers only, or you can build them where it can be direct to consumer like outside of that. So you could run ads to it directly saying same thing for you is like could you run ads direct to that software and sell it versus does it have to come through someone who's already a client and like for us or for I guess any of these things it has to have like the unique proposition. It has to have like its own standalone branding. It has to have its own thing to do that and that's why we haven't touched it. It's like it's its whole own beast that we don't want to do. We have been dumb and not done like you just said you make you know another six figures a month just off that. let's say like we could do that with supplements internal not having it its whole own thing and like we haven't even done that so like just dumb it's just like an LTV mishap leaky bucket situation but that's interesting so for the levels of access how I've tried to all these are different by the way so like who who listens to this I have there's always going to be the zero to 10ker right like crew that's just trying to understand and like but a lot of the people at least in DM I mean we got connected from me posting stuff you then right like a lot of them hundreds of high hundreds of them are six figure something a month or a seven figure a month which is amazing right so it's like the crew is there so I'm trying to navigate how to like have these these are I mean I I openly you know show the behind the scenes here of like we're just navigating how to figure this out but I'm trying to look at monetization models we're trying to look at fulfillment models we're trying to look at acquisition models we're trying to look at you know is this exit is this cash flow like what are these so so far you have the different offers that are there how does that work for fulfillment for you so like obviously a course is a course with the lower one but when it gets to group coaching onetoone done for you like what is the fulfillment model of how you do that? Yeah. So the group coaching is we use Kajjabi for our course hosting and Kajjabi we also use the Kajjabi communities feature if you ever if you ever seen that. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Just to have everything like a lot of our a lot of our clients are not techsavvy. Yeah. So we didn't always do that but we didn't we didn't want to give people like eight loginins. So we just give them one lo one login like you get your course your co your your community coaching calls everything in one login just to simplify things. So that one we have like 10 group coaching calls a week and they're all on various topics. So we have like a business setup call with doula which is like a a business setup company. So it's like a guest who comes in and runs that call. We have like partnership money monetization model. Yeah. An SEO call, Google ads call. Like all these different subbranches of e-commerce is like an expert call on. And then they have the community, the programs, and then like a bunch of bonuses. The one-on-one coaching is the exact same thing as that. You get all that. All the offers are like you get everything in the one below it plus, you know what I mean? So one-on-one, you get all that plus you get access to a Slack channel with a one-on-one coach and you can have like one-on-one calls for things like choosing your product, reviewing your ads, that sort of thing. And then hybrid done for you is everything above it. Plus, we actually pick their product. We give them a list of prevetted suppliers from the contact and we build version one of their Shopify store. And then the highest tier is we do we set up their business, choose their product, close actually close their first few suppliers for them, get 20 products live on their website and run their ads for them until they make their first sale for over $1,000. So once we make that first sale, the expectation is they're going through the program that whole time learning everything. And then once we make the sale, there's like a two to three week transition period where we're like handing the business off to them. So, it's like a done for you thing until they get their first sale and then essentially to prove the concept. They have a business generating revenue and then we go through a transition where they sort of take it over at that point and then and then they go back to the normal one-on-one. Yeah. So, that's pretty lean team though, right? For a fulfillment side. Yeah. I think we have like eight one-on-one coaches and then just like a lot of the guest coaching calls are a lot of the coaching calls are guests and we have like three customer support. But yeah, on the fulfillment side we are pretty lean. Yeah, that's that's nice. That's very I mean yeah we have how many you guys have with your offer? 70 something. 70. Yeah. It's one coaches. I mean we have 4,000 active right now and we've had upwards of higher when we were you know acquisition broke. So it's like a tail end thing. Now it's doing this again like a call. Do you guys like when when someone joins your offer do you guarantee them a set amount of calls? Is that why you have to have so many? Yeah it's one to one for a year. So you have like a structure that's basically like there are group aspects. There's like entire community layer. There's basically cohort based, so like the group coaching style where it's all them and then they have a onetoone touch point and then the entirety of the thing they have the onetoone messaging and it's customized for them. It's not like out of the box. So like in our example, you have x amount of call body types. You have x amount of like where you're currently at in your age, hormonal, whatever. And then you have x amount of desired outcome or goal. Someone wants to build, someone wants to shed, someone, you know, like these different things. you layer those across and you have you know 32 whatever options let's say of where they could go. So it's personalization still standardized kind of and like across the methodology but it it's unique and there are things that come up in the personal lives and whatever. So that our stack right now is onetoone now we're rolling out basically multi-year onetoone continuation because it gets the best results. It gets insane results. Like they get like the client wins channels like but the fulfillment model is sub 20 but like percent of you know c new cash call it like it's because we try to stay within the horosy numbers and like that backs out to a coach making like a healthy income like you know in comparison to market like all that stuff because we do everything except they just have to coach. So we flow. Are all your coaches like previous students? No coaches are not. No. So for the longest time all of our sales reps were uh like client success stories right like people who came from there so they'd come from the community and now we don't do that but we had that for the long time some of the core people on the team are still came from being uh customers but coaches no they come like full vetted have to have five to seven years experience in the space of like remote coaching they have to have xyz certification like all that stuff which is not a customer like customers never going to are very rarely going to have that that makes sense so they're like legit personal trainers at that point. That makes sense. Exactly. Just fully remote and instead of having to do any of the stuff be on floor, you know, do all the front end and back end that you have to do when you're a legit like inerson personal trainer, it's all remote coaching only. That's like all they have to do is just that. So that's why the, you know, the arbitrage is kind of there. Um, but yeah, it's and we stack them up. I mean that but they can only take whatever high teens, you know, not three figures, but they can take a high level of clients on an active roster and they're all in they're all getting the same thing. They're all doing one year of coaching. So there's like the programming you can align because it's all that a big thing that we have not done because all we've sold on the back end is just a continuation of the same thing. It hasn't really been framed as like they're getting their service contract for the year, but it's not really framed as like this is like a three to five year thing. Even though the entire methodology is already around, this is like a lifelong thing. I see. But it's like, are you going to pay for a coach forever or like do you really just need your coach for year one and then you're supposed to like go off and do this on your own now that you've learned the 8020, you might not have the accountability. You might not have the new phasing in person at like you know in our example if it's like a hormonal shift or if now you're post and before you were pre or like some in that example of menopause like it changes a lot. It changes like how the nutrition is. It changes how the exercise portion is. It changes these pieces. and if you don't have coach or access to personalization and we haven't done a good enough job of like highlighting that and and that was that's you know direct correlate to LTV. So now we're going to have as of yes two days ago Monday we're rolling out like a downell continuity that's 360 a month or like an extension of a year that's like a lifer program so it's group so our cost to fulfill on it is marginal in comparison because it's not one to one anymore it's like one you know cohort based you have to go through the onetoone first so I would go through my one year with the oneonone and then I would go on to this continuity offer that's 360 a month and it's like a group coaching thing correct you would exactly so then and then the cohorts can be more dialed in around like everyone comes with more experience and having done it for a year. They did all the you know deep work per se with the personalization and then so you're basically offered you can do that. You can either continue and we're going to do different options there where it's multi-year or just a continuation for another year either with that same coach or another coach if you want to mix because we have that's the other like kind of cool part is it's all standardized all around the methodology. It's all around the same thing, but like one of them is vegan or two of them are vegan. Like someone else is like uh you know more into uh running for like because they want to, not because it's like part of the plan, but like because they're a marathon runner and like other they have different goals. There's stage ready ones. There are women who are 50 60 that want to like do like stage competition and get like shredded shredded, not just like you know. So there's different pockets of that. So sometimes they want to move coaches. That's a multi-year style thing. And then this one is like the forever play. This is the you're a lifer. you want to stay in it. It's 360. It's the name of the program. It's the name of the It's the price. It's like you are, it's the all-encompassing lifelong thing with g with guests that come in with your, you know, access to the personalization when you want it through group and then the community of people that are all living the same vibe, the same life. And then the next play is to roll in the subs and do all that kind of stuff in the correct way. So like we're so big on brand that we haven't done that. That's why I said that earlier is like it's just you know people in supplements who it costs Yeah. Yeah. they make, you know, 90x on it. And it's just that's not our play. It never has been. We tried the partnership model. The math didn't work or yeah, the math kind of didn't work because of how their operations it wasn't as like direct response or like conversion focus is a better way, not direct response, conversion focused. So, we just bled and it just like how the pass off was wrong. But like we're going to do that and that'll be that'll be a big one. So, I think I think it'll crush. Yeah. Especially cuz like even especially in fitness like even myself I know exactly what to do but it's just like if it's not a top of mind it'll just like naturally slip. It's not like a knowledge thing. A lot of the time it's like everything else except knowledge is the most important part like being a I mean it's on YouTube. Everything is on YouTube. Every like in in almost anything we're talking about like is on YouTube and it's like the it's the 2% layer that's personalization that has the 10, you know, output. That's why that's kind of the goal of these is like if you can if someone who's doing six something figures am a month, you know, like is in that range and they hear something that is a two, a three, a five, a 10% change that they make like for a show rate or for lead flow or for partnership on the back or monetization model, it's like that's sizable. That is very sizable. Like I heard something more even more than that. Like small things that like once you start scaling and become pretty optimized. It's like the tiniest things that make the biggest difference. It's just like one line in a YouTube video or something super small. Yeah. No, that's and that's how we've learned everything throughout this. And like just doing the videos, I've noticed I have like my thinking has become more like articulate and like how I'm exactly, you know, because you kind of flip into that like teacher model of things a little bit and like you have to understand it well enough to teach it. So it's like I'm like regoing through my math and I'm like is that right? I'm like yeah cool. Like I kind of operated from like a napkin of that. Now it's in a sheet and I'm like looking at I'm like yeah and this exact number is this. I'm like interesting. How can I pull it down over here by two or three% now that I've like explained it? So, but that's enough about me. That's enough. Uh, everyone yells at me that I talk too much. So, I'm trying to keep interviewing. But, so for the goal of this, so you guys are doing I mean, you don't have to say exact numbers or exact whatever, but you're doing millions a month. Yeah, we're doing about between two and a half and three right now. Yeah. And this is alltime high right now. Yeah. So, last month was alltime high and that's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. That's hilarious because we talked whatever that was three months ago and you guys were like shifting I want to talk about that the marketing the structure of how you guys are doing the inflow now how it changed because you guys are doing direct to cart. We were doing direct to call. So I it sounds we were doing similar to you. So we had like one VSSL funnel at one price for like two years not no other offer and that's like all we did and then like launching this new front end is sort of what helped us double pretty quickly. And the new front end is direct to cart. It's the webinar. Yeah. Automated webinar direct to cart. So auto. Yeah. So it's like twofold. So it's like the actual marketing method, right? Because it's like VSSL versus webinar versus challenge. What you have all those like styles. Then the first offer being direct to cart versus direct to call. Like the efficiency goes to this, right? Because you don't have to use people essentially. You don't have to have sales team and like the flow and then the multiple touch points. So you're selling something direct to cart that's, you know, a,000 2,000 range. It's it's a $9.95 offer and then we have a bump bump on checkout that makes it 1,9.90. So buyers are split between about 50/50 between those and then the goal is as soon as they buy, we want to upgrade them to one of those one-on-one hybrid or done for you options. Are you guys profitable in the front? Just like break even. Yeah, it's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah. Ours is like, you know, I I was talking to Josh about this, like I don't know the quick liquidation percentage math off the top of my head still. Like I know the net CPA number like that of yesterday of trailing, but like for that that is but our economics break out because our ascension rate is like solid, right? So even though we lose it, we only liquidate let's just say 50%. Like the the economics back out, but when you're fully liquidating your ascension rate obviously it's important, but it's like not as Do you already I mean how long has this been running? We launched it March 22nd, so two months. Okay. So, do you have time do you have like time to ascension and like rough percentages off the top that you know? Yeah, it's usually about four to five days to upgrade. Oh, wow. That's great. The 1990 buyers, so the the people who buy the bump ascend at like a 55% clip, very high. And then the people who only buy the 9995 are like 20 to 25%. So that's been something I've been thinking about is like do I raise the price so it's or just make it one price 1990 or do we just optimize the pixel for the 1990 buyers because they're upgrading at like almost triple the rate is the 95 buyers. Yeah, I mean I would for sure I mean I would do that. I would optimize for that. The one thing so like you're you're low ticket funnel, right? Like what's your front end price right now? Sub50. So I wonder like with no order bumps with no order bumps because it back to the brand quality thing in two seconds I could throw on like you know uh three more PDFs and two of these and whatever and like we won't do that. We just won't we're just not those people who want to just do it to do it. And like maybe that's a limiting belief but we so we're having them built out. We have like the content being produced. We have that done now. It needs to be edited. It needs to be put in another Kajjabi product. It needs to be designed like all this stuff just so we can add a couple order bumps. But again ours is full ascension focused. So like you're selling something for a,000 to 2,000 like you know in that range for direct to cart. Ours fully baked is going to be you know 40 bucks to 90 bucks maybe just from the order bumps and then right after is like now book your quick start guide do that and is that how your guys' framing is? Uh essentially we have a we have an STR call them welcome to the program make sure they can actually access everything. Okay. They essentially assess interest in a one-on-one coach. Usually people say like they want to hear more about it and then we'll book them in. Yeah. Yeah. On oursel. Yeah. Go ahead. So, if you spend 10k, let's say, just for simplicity sake, how many calls will that get you on? Oh, boy. It's like the issue with ours is like I guess I don't know if it's an issue, but if I spend 10k, our AOV is about,500. So, for every 10K I spend, it only ends up being six to seven calls. So, it's super lean. So, if we spend 30K a day, it's like 20 calls, like three closers. Yeah. So, like that's what I'm wondering like with your It's so efficient, but it's so efficient because like that's where that's and I I was talking about this on another one and it's so quick math. Let's say it's a 3% or let's use five. It's easy. So like 5% ascension rate. If my target is 30 units a day of backend, it's like you need 600 load ticket on average a day or for direct to cardart or whatever you want to call it, right? Like yeah, which is crazy. But what would like what would what would your goal return on ad spend target be on that? Because I feel like with the efficiency of our funnel, we're leaving a lot on the table. Like I see it I don't see us really getting the return on ad spend above two and a half. Oh no. Yeah. We'll worry about that. Exactly. So it's like how does that work then? Wait. So if you're breaking even there, let's say you're breaking even on direct toart. You're spending 100 grand. You're making 100 grand there. And then you're saying 70 buyers. So 70 buyers and then whatever the actual upgrade percentage between the two price works out to like let's call it 30%. 30% of 70 would be what? Um like 25 20 to 25 at 5,800 it ends up being like another 100 150 grand. So how so Oh, I get what you're saying. So you're saying you're spending 100 to make 250 or whatever in that math. Exactly. So like on our VSSL funnel, we're at like a four or a five. So the profitability is way more, but it's just a like the new funnel is just way easier to run and way more scalable. But it's more like a play of would you rather make 40% margins on a million a month or 28% margins on 5 million a month. Yeah. Well, that's why so that's what we're doing. That's the what I joke like the value vortex system that my CMO claimed. You know, VVS, that's him, that's not me. But he is like, yeah, you run multiple. So the idea of the running the VSSL funnel is it's ready for the top 3% of people who are like in that pool and then the top 30% that could be in that pool or whatever and that like for us when we run a VSSL funnel it's a percent a percent and a half that will of leads will purchase which is like not that good and we understand that but like the economics on it work but if you run it in tandem to something like a low ticket or a direct to cart you have that access you also have like the risk mitigation of being able to do that, right? You're not just all in one, which we're the dumb. We did that. We did 71 million through one VSSL funnel. Like, that's it. Same with us for the first two years. It's just like, and it's great because it's so simple and it's so easy and you're just like, "Oh, I know my numbers and oh, it's this." But like, eventually there's market fatigue. Eventually there's like all these all these things. Uh, and it's just not smart to do and we didn't realize that. But if you can run them in tandem like that, yes, marketing attribution becomes a thing. Yes, understanding that. But if your blended numbers are and I don't know how you're tracking rorowaz if you're like when you're saying that you're saying new rorowaz if you're saying total total rev you know for contract value but the for us it's it's higher than that for sure because we run them both through one. So like I know my you know I use it based on CPA which is like a function basically or you know the inverse can be rorowaz depending on how you look at it but like ours is multiples when we're in this new state in place and forever it hasn't been and it's so funny but like the needle mover for us right now a lot of the numbers stayed the same in marketing KPIs and we changed our sales team KPIs I see because we had the new leader and new management come in they changed the floor basically of acceptance and overnight we went from doing 30 50 110 50 like all over the board numbers to steady state over 100 a day like steady and that alone so you take a close rate call it 15% and you get that to 30 it's like your CPA goes from call if it was five grand it's now 2500 like that one metric of close rate which makes sense like when you think of it like that but when you look at it in your marketing meetings and stuff and you're like how do we increase rorowaz how do we do whatever it's like if your cost per call is a hundred bucks and you're this and that and you know and you're your actual qualified call and you're something's that middle of funnel which sounds big but like close rate can directly swing that. Mhm. And change that. So your rorowaz goes from two to four or two to you know like Yeah. That's interesting. So is it you think that's an interesting one I think because it's like what do you want to run? I think it's just so scalable, right? Like we could it's just we could we could take like we could scale to I ran the numbers like 4 to 5 million a month with like six closers if that's all we're running which is insane to really think about. Yeah. It's very but I think I think like you said it's it's got to it's a very strong like base like I'm not sure I'm sure you know like Jason Flavlin or heard of him at least. Um like his thing is like the more webinars you run like just it's going to lift the whole business because if someone like the more people you have just going and watching a 2hour presentation like there's no way that that doesn't seep into all the other areas of the business even if the robot is like attributed that funnel isn't the best. So yeah, I think I think it's it's exactly as you said. I had a limiting belief for a long time that we're just going to run the VSSL funnel, optimize, optimize, optimize 1% here, 2% there, 3% there, and optimize. But there's only so much of that you can do, right? If you look at any of the big guys like Tai Lopez or Gran Card, it seems like they have like 10 offers going on. Eventually becomes an offer game, no doubt. Yeah. So I think it's it's like the perfect base offer and then it's like what can we put around this thing like the VSSL funnel potentially a low ticket funnel maybe a challenge funnel like what will because if we have if we have a webinar that we're spending 30k a day on like think of all those people that are attending the webinar might not be buying but then will attend a challenge funnel or will watch our VSSL just because different people respond differently to different conversion mechanisms right no for sure and like there I'm trying to remember what big I think it was I think it's Deian Grazio I don't know one of those guys that's in that realm of just like mass eyes. Maybe it's even Tony, but they talk about like having an having an offer suite where everybody has the opportunity to buy something. Everyone has a way to go from a lead, a viewer, you know, consumer to a buyer. Even if it's a dollar, even if it's $7, like having something and I also like, you know, don't agree with that until you're at size where it makes sense to do that, right? Because then all of a sudden you're just messy and fulfillment and community over here and community over here. But to layer them in strategically as you go, that's the other play for us of having such a low ticket is because our TAM is so large. I mean, so is yours, right? I guess like but the the ability to sell a,000 units a day of some like actual true true low ticket like sub50 thing gets the brand awareness maxed. And that's that whole like, you know, raises the raises all the ships type mentality because it's like just being in people's eyes, but like you're making money from those enough to either liquidate or like your ascension math on it works, but now you're you're already popping up on all these other people's feeds. It's like the highest top of funnel. It's like the brand awareness idea. And like you do that, then you understand the economics around the low ticket and the ascension side of it. And it's like that in itself makes money, but you're getting all of this thing for being able to spend 100 grand a day and get in front of everyone's eyes. And then someone has seen you then they do go over to your cold stuff or your organic more so and then like live over there for a while and then now they become over two weeks, two months, two years if you're playing the long game. One of the people who come in the VSSL funnel then or go to your main site apply direct and are like, "Yeah, cool. I'll do a piff in two seconds." It's like because they've done that. But that's that's just like depth and like moat around that for the front end. Yeah. I remember I remember like Grant Cardone in one of his interviews said something like one of the main metrics he looks at is how many people are googling him every month. Like he goes on like HFS or a keyword tool like what is that trend look like? So if you look at your brand like if you if you run if you're spending 100k a day on a low ticket funnel like there's no way it's not going up. Yeah. For sure. But if you're only spending, you know, five or 10 grand a day because you're in this pocket and you have like this 8x rorowaz thing and you're like, "Oh, I'm just going to hone in and like do it for cash." It's a great thing, but it just depends on your goal. So it's like if you were going for size and and scale, but that's very interesting your economics on the So I guess the other question though, that's like your rorow. So when you're saying that, that's your collected rorowes. Okay. Okay. So what's the LTV look like on these people? What are you offering them on the back? What's the community? What's the like what's the continuation after they get said program? You make another 100 grand a month or whatever quick number from the software. So that's an LTV play, but like what else is there something else to make it? So like cuz the big guys lose money for however long to acquire customer you're over, you know, you have great metrics and like trying to scale those or figure those out on both VSL and low ticket, but like how do you make them 10x on the back when you look at rorowaz of the whole company? Yeah. So, we two things. We started doing something similar to you where like we'll have we have we have like a $3,000 a month or $3,000 they can pay another six months. So, the first first six months is 6K and that they can get off for 50% off to stay in with their one-on-one coach for another six. So, a lot of people do that. Um, it's definitely over six figures a month right now in that. But then something else we did that I think is pretty interesting is we built like a Shopify app where like if you join the program, so for your six months in the program, we actually own 6% of your revenue and then once you graduate, we own 1% forever. If you're in one of the done for you programs, like the higher up ones, it's it's six and two. So we essentially own like tiny pieces of revenue in every single client store as of the last few months. So we're just rolling that out still. Yeah. So this app gets installed on their store and then essentially every month we debit the percentage of sales that they make. So the idea there is that that will be a big amount. Yeah. Yeah. And then is there some tradeoff? I mean is there a trade-off for then like continued access for that for the forever thing or is it b it's built into the current structure of like service that you just get it for the f? Yeah. Interesting. You just get it there and then long term it's just part of the deal. Yeah. And you see that clients and all that kind of stuff like do size after you guys? I mean you I'm sure you have some I see some of your testimonials and your reviews and stuff for sure on the starter portion of like people understanding it getting set up. Do you have guys who have gone off and done like whale size stuff like large or like continue to run them at scale? Yeah. Yeah. We've Yeah. Obviously like small percentage of people but we've had some that's always half of the people aren't going to show up to the first coaching call though. Yeah. Like that's Yeah. Like like there are people who are doing like like one guy in particular within a year. So he went from complete beginner he was like working in like corporate real estate or something by 12 months he was doing like over two and a half million a month on his store. It's crazy. Like I was kind of margin what kind of mar I mean I know you quick said the the unit margin but at that scale like what kind of margins on two? I would guess around 10 to 15. Yeah. Had to guess. Solid. No inventory risk though. Like exactly right. With e-commerce, like if you make 15% margin, it's your own brand. Like you're putting 12 of that back into more inventory where here we don't have to front anything for inventory. So it's a lot. It's still cash flow play. Yeah. I always talk about what like how far can you take a business and like the depth and like you obviously have that at your info coaching style level but as somebody who's in there what is like as somebody who'd be a client of the program they go to there they get to these type of scale what else can they do to do they is there a play to then roll out their own SKUs that are so like you know that they do hold inventory on is that a play is like what's the what is the mth degree that someone could take it that into their own branded. Exactly that. So that's that's kind of why I said before that a lot of people that end up doing really well longterm have niche stores. Like imagine if you had a store selling 50 different products. It's hard to launch your own brand because it's like you don't really have you're not really attached to any item where we had one guy I won't give away his product but essentially he had like a very niche store selling a very niche product. Like let's this isn't it but if you were selling sauna you're drop shipping sauna then if you have this whole store this email list with 50,000 people who love saunas you maybe you have a community on school it's very easy to then launch your own sauna brand on your store. So we've had a few people do that but that would be like the the nthderee two three four five year play. Yeah, I know some like a lot of these back channels talk uh in Telegram and a lot of them do ecom, but it's either drop ship or some of them do like, you know, and then there's also the gray guys and stuff like that that'll do things in there. But I hear a lot of the time now that people are figuring out a way to bolt info community coaching style stuff on the tail of physical. So like obviously that might I mean actually that's not true. It could work in a sauna game. Like that's a good example of like a sauna, but the the guys who are crushing are doing that, but like multiaceted. So it's like yes, you have a community of people who are all buying the sauna and like that brand or whatever, but like taking it to the next layer of a community around that, the other SKS, the other things that you buy, the other partnerships around like those things, those guys are doing size. Yeah, like size. I like when I was run like my one of my main products on the first store was Saunas and I didn't understand meta ads at the time. Like all I knew was Google, but ever since I've had the itch to like run a call funnel to a sauna. Like I know I know it would crush. Oh yeah. Nobody's doing it though, right? Like right now you don't see anybody running like UGC ads to No, you see sunlighten or whatever and like they end up getting and then they hammer it once they get you in though. But like the what you're saying there end of it is the issue. It's like the conversion is there. It's once you submit a form, they will call you from six different numbers. They'll call you from localized. They'll text you from this. You'll get an account manager who's super nice. that's, you know, some pretty younger thing. Like you'll do they'll they do the whole gambit of that part. But like that's like almost the middle. It's like the front like you're saying could be so much better with UGC with like the like how to get your the booking form is the ugliest most hard to navigate request quote now like that part of it. And then I'm sure the back end I haven't bought one of them direct cuz I live in apartments and I don't want to do that yet. And uh but like the back end I'm sure is like they sell you that and then there's some service stuff but even that community around a sunlighter or whatever those would crush they do crush these guys in these groups do it with no brand with their own you know made a brand in a weekend type thing and then have evolved it and there's even plays like I think I think now like a lot I really like the model of e-commerce like I think the the smartest best e-commerce brands now it's like it's almost a product like a whoop where like you break even on the product and then you sell a subscription software like that you need to use the product. Another good one is like something like I have a buddy of mine who's crushing it with like uh shower heads. So you buy like a a shower head that filters let out, but then you need to get a new filter every every two months. Like that's like because then you get the MR too, right? That's the problem with like a high ticket product is a lot of the time it's just one purchase. So then eventually like if you're going to have your own high ticket brand, you would have to add other product lines to cross-ell or figure out a way to have some sort of software attached to your product or or supplements would probably work too to build up the MR. Yeah, that's super interesting. So, what do you what's your goal of your of your info, your coaching style? I mean, is it the make 50 or whatever number and kind of just chill? I mean, I know you posted stuff with family and like that's amazing. Like, you you live in that like how I perceive it, right, from internet and stuff and we haven't talked like this. This is our, you know, first direct, but we DM and stuff. You have the a version of a good mix. what it looks like. You're not the penthouse Lambo kid, but like you're also living like the nice luxury, you know, internet style life. So, like what's your goal of this? Is it to just run this and work, you know, scale down the your hours but make a ton of income? Is it exit this? I don't know if this exits like what's the play? Yeah, it's a really good question. So, I think like immediate goal is we want to bring it to 5 million by the end of the year per month, which I think is definitely doable. And longer term, I'm not I'm not really sure. Like I was having a chat with um Jason about this last week like about what should the end goal of a business like this be and like he made a good point to me. He's like don't try and make the business something it's not which he his point was a lot of people do. It depends on the niche. Like I think I think your yours in particular has um like a very strong brand and I can see exit value. I don't know if ours does. So yeah like I invest a ton of money now like I put up pretty much all my income just in investments and stuff. So I think in like on a long scale like 10 to 15 years my ideal scenario would just to be like be just capital allocating investing in different companies um spending lots of time with my family being able to travel lots um but at the same time I can't really imagine not running a business actively. Yeah that's that's what I love doing the most especially the marketing side of things. So I think now like we have a really good thing going on. Um I really enjoy it. We have a great team. Um and we're we we built the one software out. Who's to say that we can't make some tweaks to that and that ends up being something bigger? We're building out other software other softwares or considering building building out other software. So, I'm not in a huge rush. Like everything's going well right now. I don't want to overthink it, but at the same time um you the the words Jason used was like once I guess every offer will eventually fatigue and rather than trying to spend time plugging holes on a sinking ship like you can just build a new ship, a new offer, a new front end. So I think that's what we're trying to do now that we didn't do is put on these different front ends. So we have the webinar now. We'll probably I'd like to try challenges seem to be crushing right now. So try one of those and then the more of these offers we have the more longevity the business will have. But yeah I don't know like I think what do you think like in in an info offer if you have let's say a few softwares that are all doing decent numbers per month. Do you think that it's it's almost like a new industry that VCs aren't familiar with? But like hypothetically, they spit cash. So why would they not be sellable? If you do the right things, like if which I've done over time is try and remove myself from the brand, so use less of me in ads. I'm not in the course videos anymore at all. So all the courses are taught by different coaches. Um I'm not in the coaching calls. So it's like if there's like and for me it's like it's not like I have a huge organic presence. So it's like if someone else is in the ads, is it really going to make that much of a difference? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, spade a spade, right? 0.001% of these have sold in the past, right? Just is what it is. And the list of things that I know of, and I'm sure there's 50 things I don't know of why they couldn't sell, but like it's exactly what you're saying. It's the founder risk. It's the consistency around the future cash. It's the reliance on the risk that exists within the acquisition and the having to spin different things up. um founder risk both of you operating and of in the ads which like you said you're out of ops but like you're definitely still the brand fit you're the one I see all the time even when I see ads but that just might be my algo but like that piece of it and then the the consistency of future cash and the believability around it the the math behind that and then the entire business operating data numbers clean like that whole portion which almost every single one of those boxes either is you know not checked in most of these or some of the core ones are not checked in most of these. So the I don't know because I think the software thing is like I think I think it's just like an MR play, right? It's just like how you choose to fulfill it. So instead I could have a coach that just does group coaching and like if you're just looking at the numbers, it's the same. It's like a recurring thing that comes in. They you know the usability, the sticky, you know, you just what's the math on the churn? the math on, you know, your gross margin on it and what's the consistency of it across whatever time and in my simple opinion. But like if those things can't stand alone or are not in their own right, it's like what are they buying? They're just buying the cash flow. But like that but for example with your new offer, the low ticket continuity. Like let's say if in three years from now 60 to 70% of your revenue is from that and you have low churn. Like to me that's a very sellable business. For sure. That's why we're doing it for sure. I mean, it's one we're doing it because it's like we've been dumb and it's like this leaky bucket thing. And that's why I'm trying to like figure that out more and more as we go. But supplements, you know, consumable, recurring, get pissed if they don't come in the mail the next month. Like that is a core one, especially for our model because we teach so much around that around like the core piece and then supplements are truly a supplementation to the core. And then also so much of our stuff is around weight training and like muscle development which a lot of that stuff can is almost needed in supplements because they it's hard for them to hit the numbers that they needed to hit within eating just in eating like protein number for example it's easier to supplement that with something. So like that's one and then the continuity community play if we hammer that and actually do it. I mean, quick numbers, 3,000 people, like million bucks a month and then 95% margin on it, you know, couple CS and then some group coaches where the math math. So, like that's the play. I agree. That's the play because then you've got 10 million a year in, you know, Iba, which is like whatever because there's Yeah. But like, you know, if we're talking selling stuff, it's like that's the number from there. And then how they consistently get into that because then now you have that as like look at that as an isolated model and it's like how do they come in? It's like they're coming in as customers from over here. Okay. So now this one becomes very important. How do the customer like how does this one fulfill and how do they get here to make it so that does can exist on the back and then go even further on the front and it's like are you running from one ad account with one face the one face is someone who's an owner and you know these things and it's like so that's why right now we have we just got done filming I don't think I've talked to you about this but we just got done filming three different VSSLs with three different brand faces. Oh no way. So we have three brand faces now that all are on a different me messaging line different ages or like how are they different different yeah yeah different demos but the messaging is different so like for us let's say it's like mindset uh macronutrients muscles let's just say as an example but like so one is all about like strength training is the mechanism in some way shape or form this one is all about how you know menopause or metabolism is this one is all about how it's macronutrient based like as an example so both the person is different the message line is different all under the one umbrella of the brand. And so those are going to be three different VSSLs. So the ad, the opt-in page, like the images and stuff and alignment is there and then the VSSL and then when they hit application is when they all kind of like branch in together. So how do you how do you communicate to the sales rep or are does it make a difference to the sales process? It won't though. That's yeah, that's the point is it won't because it'll come together prior. So it's going to come together prior there and like the pass off is almost there. So like the original so you as an example it it'll it would come in to by the time that they were applying they understood that they were applying for you know your specific thing and then you are become the founder the creator of the you know XYZ ecom method the something and these other people are like either brand ambassadors or face or what whatever you want to call them internally or customerf facing I don't we haven't actually identified how we're going to do that in the direct pass off because right now we're doing this and we're running those three brand faces on the ad side And we attempt to kind of do the pass off, but we literally it's like an ad of them. Yeah. Under our brand stuff, but then it lands on an opt-in page that has our main brand face as the image on there. They opt in, whatever. And we still we have you know we have sets in there that are 7x rowaz that are that with no continuity because they're like yeah as soon as it hits that page it's like you're going to tell me I can't get a 10% 20% lift on an opt-in that aligns face to face and then you're going to tell me after that they go to a VSSL that is not them either. So it's like we're going to try and take those three sections add optin uh VSSL and align them across three hit those I mean we did 70 through one. You're going to tell me you can't do 20 to 50 or whatever through each of them and then do also the thing with the low ticket. How'd you find these people? Online just on on on Instagram organic built up and like we're not going to use their organic distribution. I mean maybe but we we're not even using their distribution. So you just said like hey you want to be a face for our brand and then you'll give them Yeah. So, it was a thing we've talked about for a while when it was like, oh, founder risk and all this and we uh we got a like cart and head ahead of the horse vibe and we hired before we moved everything to W2 before this whole like exit potential play and we were just so off base and wrong. We did not even focus on to this moment I can't tell you certain numbers and things around what exists within fulfillment and churn and LTV and stuff in like a proper way. I can give you averages. is I can give you napkin math but like can I pull it up and see do I know how many go from this to like cash collection percentage like there's all this stuff and that is 100% the thing that's going to take us to the next level now that marketing and sales is like the inflows are there now let's do risk mitigation let's you know consistently try and keep that cost per call or whatever here sales keep them in these KPIs high performance culture now it's going to be what happens within fulfillment how is the fulfillment for year one framed in a way that this is the next three years or five what is the you know churn and how do we make it the stickiest community ever for the you know downell opportunity or whatever that is and build that all around there. But yeah, you zoom into the marketing and it's like how do you risk mitigate and do that across there and do it with a team because you you the new risk is the expert the other experts, right? is like using these brand faces then all of a sudden you have all stuff built around them and then you know worst case is something happens but normal cases someone either you know wants more XYZ or thinks that this or structure they want to go stand alone and do their own thing now and like there's all that kind of stuff but that's that's just life but that's interesting yeah because I'm actually working on a new VSSL now it's me but in the VSSL itself we have we filmed like four different angles like the first five minutes are different but I almost wonder like hearing you say that makes me think like my My plan would was going to be like test the five angles, whatever one's the best. If it beats the control, just run that. But like why not just leave the current one running and just like Yeah. So we Yeah. So we just we just that same thing. We we do three leads when we do ours. So we have three complete different VSSL scripts that then have three different leads in them for each one. So like Yeah. And then usually and then like rather than trying to find a winner, you'll see like a couple of winners and leave them just both running because they're different. That is such a highly debated topic. internally. That is such a highly debated topic because we have two that are like pretty different that for the last seven months we had a 50-50 split on the control on like the main that we would just let run Uh-huh. Well, like well because they were so dead like all the way to the backed out numbers of like deal closed it was like a percent difference like not even just talking like application and booking like down to the dollar of what they each like collected at at the VSSL at the actual cold one the one that comes in right there not the replay page not the whatever like this one just raw 5050 do you have do you have data how many people watch both I have yeah I have everything on this is that happen all all the time did people watch both and then buy well okay so that was the difference is we picked one of them to put on the replay pages. I see. Yeah. One that we thought was kind of more in alignment, but like we let them run forever and like what you're saying is like if we had two different leads and you know they had similar stats and then what's the reason? And our CMO came in and was like that is the silliest thing I've ever heard. Like no, if it if it doesn't beat a control, go back to the control like immediately. Don't split test your way into you know to zero which is our thing like we were talking about earlier like a two and a five and a whatever and you're just going to optimize optimize optimize. eventually somehow you break what you had. It's very common to do that where you're trying to find your two and 5 percent lifts across your VSSL funnel and next thing you know it's like this isn't in alignment with this. You try and change this back to this but now it's not in alignment with the other six changes you made. And like that's a that's a real thing too. That's interesting though because it's like we were talking earlier about like the key to scale is adding more frontends. So if I have like this VSSL like let's say I can spend 10K a day on this VSSL with this angle about the whole ang the whole angle of the VSSL is about selling high ticket products and like let's say every dollar above 10K is diminishing returns. So I have this VSSL here and I make this new VSSL that also does very well but the whole angle around that is around the US China trade war. So there's no I don't actually say the model in the first five minutes about US China trade wars. to me like it's very easy to see like how I could spend 10k here and spend 7K here and get the same roses on them both where like I couldn't spend 17k on this one only. Okay. Well, I agree with that because that's more along the lines with the different messaging and like how we're talking about how we could do you know 20k a day is rough. Let's just that's pretty rough to our number is like 20k a day on where I don't want to say like diminishing returns but kind of diminishing returns on like an optunnel for us and there are people who can run to a VSSL and spend 300 grand a day direct. So like it's generally the the quality of the VSSL or the conversion mechanism like how that actually works. But for us call it 20Gs. So like we should be able to do that three times over. And I think that's what you're saying the same thing. It's like you should be able to do that with even just a different lead and your same same VSSL with a different lead. Do that and it's standalone. Yeah. I mean I think that would work. Yeah. I'll try it. Worst case it doesn't work. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Worst case it doesn't work. I want to go to these questions over here because people actually asked some questions. So let me pull this up. But um oh here's a good one. Uh if you had to launch a high ticket offer today with zero audience, zero case studies, and zero past clients, what would you do to get your first three sales this month? Zero audience, zero case studies, zero past clients. It's a tough one. That's so I guess like I I can probably build an audience within a month that gets at least three sales. Yeah. Assuming I'm I know what I'm talking about, right? So I would just pick what I'm good at. start posting YouTube videos, tweets, like that's what I did for the first year of our offer. I didn't have any paid. It was just Twitter and YouTube. That's it. Um, so I'd probably just do that. Pick something I'm good at, start making content on it on YouTube and Twitter specifically, and then that would get you your first three clients. Um, but I think like if like let's say if you're going to be like an a back-end person who's running the offer, um, and you can kind of pick pick whatever niche you want to go into and just find someone to be the face of the brand. I would say you just want to look at like hot trends like right now if if 10 if five years ago you were going to start an offer on how to start an agency just start how to start an AI agency. Yeah. Today. Yeah. Just find the the hot whatever it is like right now AI paste that into use that in whatever market and I think it'll be pretty easy. Yeah. I think the core thing you said that stood out for was the what is something I already know, right? It's like everything after that is just how do you get eyeballs on it? How do you you know actually convert them? But like you have to actually know something or that. And too many times I talk about all the time on here, but like the person who teaches people how to make money and they make their money by teaching people how to make money. And it's like that stuff drives me insane. Like drives me crazy for that that niche. But because you came to this because you're like, "Oh, I did this. I built this business model. Now here's how I built the business model." Right? It's like I ran it. So I think what a lot of these guys will have and I get this in my DM for the the 0 to 10k guys is like how do I get going and like sell launch a high ticket thing and they don't have they haven't done anything. Yeah. I would say you should at least like minimum of like you should at least be doing like millions of dollars in revenue and whatever the thing is. Yeah. Minimum. Minimum. Yeah. And it's like then it's like at some level you know why and you know we you and I have talked offline on like where yours came from. There's some people who would go as far to be like why even teach it then? Why wouldn't you just run it at scale? And it's like you already said you already said what the at a certain point where the cap exists or if you have to go into this next level of business model versus doing layering on info and coaching. I think the other thing is like a lot of people miss like I think get this wrong is like the people who come into our program like they're not expecting nor even have the goal to make millions of dollars. Like they want to make $2,000 a month. Like for most people that is a life-changing amount of money. So like it's there's like certain like like most people that we work with would never want to run the business model we have now with 60 employees um lots of stress like they just want to make a a couple thousand a month and go watch his baseball games, right? So there's like certain business like the an info business is not that. Yeah. No. At all. Like it's very stressful. Um fulfilling on clients. Um yeah. So like I think you just have to know your clients what they want. But I think like as long as you're clear on that in your messaging, then like what like the the offer should be tailored to whatever the clients actually want. Like in our case, that's what it is most of the time. So like there's not like for me now running a big offer. It's completely different. Like we have coaches who now teach these people who came through the program last year and got the results that they want. So like an example I always think of is like oh your CS is our clients, past clients. Past clients who have done well. So good, dude. That's so good. Yeah. So, it's like like for example, if you were to learn if someone in our program, like they would probably take more from our coaches who went through the program in the last 6 months than someone who's like making $300 million a year but hasn't been at that first level in 10 years because it's so unfamiliar to them. They don't remember what it's like, you know? That's so Yeah. No, that we used to have that where it was our CS and I mean it kind it kind of still is. We have like the legacy people, but we got to that point where we needed the experience that was like external that you couldn't get from being within there. But in something like this where like the model changes and the market changes, how it's done. Like ours is pretty foundational. It's pretty core, right? It's like there's not there's not necessarily a new tactic or way or thing or like what software stack you're using. Like that doesn't exist in ours. But you got to watch the video from uh last night where I talked to Ahmed. His is organic exclusively. They then sell into MR communities almost exclusively and it's like it's all those trading guys, but like he picks like the Black Swan, not like the Miami Penthouse guy. Like he picks like the legit guys that can do like extreme depth. So because they can do that, they can do mid to long form YouTube that gets like the right person. They then put them in these MR communities. So they have no cost to get them in there other than whatever you pay for your content team. Basically they get MR for extended amounts of time where people stay in there because most of them want access to like the live information not for the education, right? Because they're getting like signal chats and they're getting like updated things in that way. And then the ones who do want to learn then ascend to a five or a 10k thing for info that can go as high as 25 30k whatever you could do in person. and you can do all these different things and it's like this juggernaut spinning and like I think that's a another example of like where you how you can monetize it if you have to I mean start small and it's it's almost like a personal brand that carries. It's the same thing. It's like it's not going to sell. He said some of them have sold based on the data they have not on the actual like business they have. So how much data they have and like on these people and what like platforms and the and the stuff moving around. But that was a extremely interesting like frame shift for me. I was like oh cuz theirs is literally flipped. you're like done with you or you're done for you is 30 grand or whatever, their done for you is like $90 a month really because the the education is the back. I see. Because someone who wants to like learn how to fish versus just like someone, you know, that's I was thinking about this last week like another great way to add longevity and even Mr to an info offer is like most programs out there, it's just a program, right? Like these are the modules you go through, keep them up. Yeah. Like how can you add stuff to keep that fresh? Like whether it's a live call like for us it could be like every week I do a live training session on like this week I'm going to teach you how to write laboratorals using AI and every week there's this new thing almost like a subs a paid newsletter you're subscribed to that makes them want to stay. Yes. Which is so much more powerful than just like here's the course go through it once you've done the course there's not any new value. Yeah. The a synthesis of me hearing a hormone and an Iman podcast both who I like respect in the space heavily. Like I think those guys have done it well in info and like have you know beyond gone beyond. But Horoszi talks about how when they sold and what a piece of what they sold is people stay basically for they'll test ads. So gym launch or whatever they'll test ads using like their setup in these local markets. Once they find winners of going through and finding losers too and spending the money, they then will release those ads basically in same thing like a you know a blast to everyone who buys their stuff and those people who stay and pay recurring because they get fresh ads delivered right so yes they have all this other stuff too and the the training and I'm sure you know that's a million things but like the one thing he talked about was like access to that list essentially that is refreshes and comes out new and that's why the MR is there because they're going to be upset like they're going to be upset if their subscription doesn't go through because next month. Now they have no new ads. They don't know how to do that part of the business. And it turned into more of like done for you for that portion that they have recurring. That's Iman talk about it where he's like, you know, info that it's in in itself info does not ascend or MR like style because you're teaching them they want they're coming for to learn one thing and it's like your course or your whatever your program like it teaches them the thing and unless you have the next evolution of that or something that is like that where you stick and stay into it like you're saying and that's almost like even a version of continue education but like the software ware where they're accessing it and they like if you don't have that us as an example right like a lot of our stuff has been around teaching them how to do it while also them doing it. So after year one, it's like, "Okay, go do your thing." And like that's us devaluing what we're doing because without doing a disservice to the customer and like not teaching them and like gatekeeping because that's not how I want to play either. But like there's still a way to do it where like you put value on the other pieces or you like all a cart almost or like build the other offer that's around the personalization, the community, the things you can't get unless you stay within here versus like differentiate it out and pull it out from the education and and identify that I think is a huge thing. So when when Hormosi sold he said that that was a big reason of why is they had that piece. To my understanding, it's the act they had I mean they built the juggernaut of he's the one he has a video that has the it's the one where it's like the the Mosy Lisa thing and it's Yeah. And he has the different boards he puts up there. It's like you need clean financials, you need, you know, a team that runs it that when you come back it's at the same place or better than when you left. You need this and founder risk is one of them. And then the other part is like the consistency of future cash. And for them it was this big acquisition thing. and it was just like making a ton of cash, but they built in the supplement company and all that stuff in the back, which is this big RMR thing instead of and they got distribution through their customers. So, they went like two layers, right? So, like for us being like, oh, we have 10,000 customers. I can sell supplements to these 10,000 customers. Their were theirs was we can sell C to our however many thousands of customers, but their customers were gym owners that then had their clientele. So, it was like two layers of distribution. Yeah, that's very to be able to do that and do an affiliate model. So like they got compensated. So it was like a flywheel in there. So now you have now you have recurring subscription there then which is you know recurring cash and then how they kept and this is again to my understanding of what I've heard online. This is not to say this exactly how this was but then the other piece of it was the recurring for the info. You know that's why they called it licensing because they were licensing out their ads. they were licensing out like their their formula, their structure, their everything where that was being updated real time. So, you're paying for access to the licensing information, not so much paying for, oh, here's how I do it a toz and now I continue to pay for what when I already learned how to do the model. Makes sense. Yeah, it's super interesting. It's almost like the next evolution of the lynch pin. Like the lynch pin was like you get these people in for your info, you put them on your software, you build up the software. But it's like you get clients in and then you teach them how to sell your software or teach them how to sell your supplements themselves. Super interesting. That's how dude that is. That's you just said that and that totally sparked my brain. I learned how to run call funnels and how to do all this. So Russell Brunson all so what he used to do what is that exact business model is he used to teach the blackbox business model. Have you heard of this? No. Yeah. This was like a big thing and that he did for a long time and it works for all kinds of things because it's a black box and but it's essentially you teaching you're it's like the most meta meta thing ever. You're selling the blackbox through webinar VSSL this whole thing. You're selling this blackbox business model. You're selling the blackbox business model. They then come through it and then when they join it is you're basically teaching them how to run the blackbox business model and they're like an affiliate for you. So the example of this is there was one I I don't even remember the name like digital course creator or like somebody some branded something. They ran this VSSL funnel explaining how you're going to learn how to run VSSL funnels basically and how you're going to learn how to get clients and do all this kind of stuff and sell things on the internet and sell high ticket things and get commissioned for it and how you can basically be like a high ticket uh affiliate basically. So, similar to your like kind of frame, but like with with info and coaching is what you're teaching them instead of in that. You come into there, then they teach you everything a toz. It's like here's how you set up your ClickFunnels account. Here's how you do this. Here's how you you know find these different affiliates. Here's how you whatever. And right there it's like or do you want to get 40% commissions right now and just help us sell this? Oh, no way. Yeah. And so it works for that. I know a ton of people who did it with like that an adjectic or like Kangan water thing. That's the model they used. So like the direct sales model, people who do MLM will do it. They'll sell this business model. Here's how you have your at home like make money online business. It's through this. There's a blackbox business model. They'll sell it and then in there it's like cool now you need to you order this, order this, order this. And they become like a distributor under your direct sales network or multi-level marketing or whatever. Some people hate them and pyramid scheme them. Some people make, you know, tens of millions of dollars a year. I know both of them. Uh and then they become distributors for them and then they use those funnels to then do the same thing on theirs. And it's like this. Yeah. It's interesting because like that to me doesn't like what you described doesn't scream enterprise value to me. But like let's say if I but I think you can do it with enterprise value. Like let's say if I had a software I built and I'm going to teach people how to run let's say I'm going to I'm going to run a an offer uh showing people how to start an agency and the agency the agency they're going to run is targeting local business owners to use AI in their business. And let's say I built like three AI softwares that all these local businesses are going to need and then I have my clients fulfill targeting these local businesses who need my software. Like that's a really interesting way to actually build up the enterprise value of those softwares. Yes. Agreed. Yeah. But then it becomes part of that hole, right? It's like if they're not standalone, it becomes part of the whole which is essentially kind of what we said with the Ormozi model. But I talk I I've said this on every single one of these I've had, but it's like how deep can you take the business model and when going that depth is when you start to I think reach the levels that unlock the ability to sell and start to build the true enterprise value versus like you have an offer and it's like just you know you're a sales rep basically and you're like turn cash in cash out then you're you know the offer owner then you're you know multi then you have software you have multiple offers you have you know a team around it. you start to go up these layers of where you can go with it and that is what unlocks it I think. So yeah, cuz it's like if you don't have that, like even if you get which would be like very generous for most of these businesses, like a 2 to 3x multiple on your profit, like why would you not just keep your business? Like you have to like find a way to get it up to like six, seven. Yeah. More than that. Exactly. The only way is what we're talking about now, like Mr. Longterm. I have I'm it's like a black box for us because no one has really sold in ours either, which is a tell is just, you know, should be screaming straight in my face again that it's a 001% chance. Like I understand that, but I don't know where it'll even land, you know, and if you just do it based on like C on, you know, Ibida numbers or whatever, supposedly when you when you leave that five range, like you get past 5 million in IBA range, you start to get into like the eight figure range in Ibida, the multiple in itself just climbs because that is just it reaches like enterprise, right? It's like who who do the buyer it's because the buyer pool increases. It's who is willing to buy something like that. It's like goes from like strategic to like you know middle market or whatever they call small and then up to where there's actual private equity players that are willing to just buy and hold almost on some of these things and have efficiencies. So I wonder if we can get to 20 30 50 in IBIDA that would be insane that could be 8. But then do you want to sell that business 50 business if you get if you get 8 to 10x maybe? 100%. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Getting eight years of cash up front is Yeah. real real. And eventually, I don't know. I mean, like the other the other comparable ones in our space, like they sold, but really they just kind of like closed down or just like, you know, peace and parted. Oh, the domain has X or the email list has this or the whatever they could sell. Um, like also like most of these have like earnouts, right? You might get I'm sure. Yeah. The goal is to get out of that too, which is then eating the cash flow on the way up. So like when you are how I'm understanding it is when building to get there you're biting cash now for this multiple out into the future because you know simple example is if you're operating and it's whatever you want to you want to hire one it's 200 grand let's say right it's like that 200 grand you now are not making because you're trying to build this in a way and structure it in some way for this 0.01% 01% chance that's going to happen where you're going to have it and you can't be the one operating when you sell it. So, it's like you're trying to like play this game that for something that might not ever happen. Yeah. It's really weird. And in the short term burning all this stuff that you could just be like lean, mean, and that's why it's like what's your goal and what's realistic because if you just want cash flow and you want to make five 10 million bucks a year, like this is pretty simple to do it. Yeah. Simple, not simple, not easy. Have you have you removed yourself yet or there's still things that I have put myself more in more in? Yeah. No, no. Way more in. I was not Yeah. I don't really I don't know. I don't talk about it too much in here, but like I was really mainly more I've always understood the marketing part. I've always been understood it not run it. Like I'm not a I'm not a great copyriter. I'm not a great like eye for creative, but I've understood the idea of the acquisition is probably a better way to say it. And like the I've always been plugged in all the communities and groups and direct response world and what's hot in VSSLs versus webinars versus low ticket. I wanted to do low ticket a year and a half ago, two years ago and I was not in a place in space in life or like my involvement to where that was re like reasonable to get done. It was like what do you mean the VSSL funnel is working good? I wasn't that plugged into marketing other than just understanding what's happening and like that was that. And then as things have progressed, I have stepped way more in into ops, full system people, all the, you know, everything marketing, everything sales, everything tech because I built all the tech stack from the ground up, like myself. And now that's what I'm trying to we have a senior tech lead that does better than I do, but isn't like enterprisegrade. So I'm like, do I need to almost That's the department I think is going to break next like data fulfillment data style thing. And so I'm trying to How do I how does that scale? It's like we need probably like, you know, CTO is an aggressive title, but like that style of something and I want them to come with the experience of like a Cardone, a Robins, a Graziosi, like a something. How do these guys do that at scale with their data management and structure of tech? Yeah. I think I just hired someone like this. Like I think for like like I do all the marketing still to this day and like there would be things that I know we needed to do and I wanted to do but I just didn't know how to do them tech-wise like countless things. And then I like I brought we brought in this new guy um he doesn't have experience in the info space but he he's worked at like CloudFare High up like can do like solve problems that I couldn't figure out in months in like five minutes on the tech side of things but I think that unlocks the marketing to a level that I agree. Yeah. I I still do to this day all the marketing tech. Yeah, it's so important. It's so important. And I think that's also like it's it's definitely like a skill set, but is it for the future pacing like I'll I'm trying to like have the like you know this is a conversation example, but like this or like highle decision conversations or thoughts around everything in like the sales thing and it's like oh hey we need to over here we want to launch three split tests for VSSL funnels like is this right? And like I have done a poor job of removing myself while taking on all these other pieces. So that's the next piece is like the simple answer is I need a marketing tech. Okay, that's an easy hire. I need then the bigger one is the data and the full data structure which needs to be completely overhauled from the ground up. We need like source of truth. We need to I I think I'm going to move everything into custom objects and HubSpot and like I can yap all day about this part, but like that's the next piece. And instead of me doing it or hiring an external service provider to come out and build it and then like hand it off, I am like can I just swing for the fences and get somebody that's that's my push to the universe by the way if anyone's out there or knows. I want like Cardone's tech guy and not to like not to poach but like I want someone of that caliber or of that understanding level of where they kind of get the info coaching. I mean all it is is service without like real cost, right? It's like a service model. It's like what are the contract values? How are these in here? What are the ascension rates? I need all of that data. I already have all the marketing and sales data. Now how does that connect at the customer level to fulfillment and to finances and to like ascension and all of that in a clean way that's not you and me sending each other Google Sheets. like I need it in databases that then have viewers that have connections and like relational like I need all of that. That's what we're building out now is like a data warehouse with like nice graphs because right now same as same as it sounds like you like we're on we're on Hopspot but it's all like Google Sheets like all my marketing data is on Google Sheets but we have to get that in a data warehouse which I I would have no idea how to set up at all but making everything connect. So like even for like lifestyle marketing like do you know how I said before that like the webinar buyer comes in at $9.95 or 1990 like we want to be able to for example if in Kajjabi if they buy the program and then don't log in for two weeks send a zap to HubSpot tag an SCR to reach out to that person which that's all tech. Yeah. Like I can know to do that but if I know how to set it up it doesn't mean anything. Yeah. Well here's my issue is I know how to do that and I've I've known how to do that and that would take me two minutes to set up or 12 minutes to set up. My issue is I've now done that 300 times and there's no documentation and there's no structure and there's no whatever and something breaks and someone doesn't get a notification and it's like where is it? And then the data piles and sources because I've done so many of these like crazy cool hybrid like we're so tech advanced and we are but we're not in a structural like foundational way. They've just layered onto each other. It's like literally you imagine a someone wrapping duct tape over and over and over and over and over. Eventually, it's just like you just have this giant bump of duct tape and it's like it's held together. It's fine. It's not going anywhere. It's not going anywhere. But like at the same time, do you want to like, you know, put an airplane on the other end of it or is it going to snap in half? And it's like, yeah. So, I'm over here 10 million a month, 20 million a month. Like, let's go. Which just on paper is just more volume of the same. Like, it's an automation. It's going to work, but if it can't get us simp, the things that are a little hard now are going to be very difficult there. Like very very difficult. And it's almost hard like don't you find that like once where you're at now, it's so much harder to like go back and fix that if you just start from scratch today, it would be so easy to do what you want to do. That's the hard part. And that's why when I'm saying I'm this next layer is like if I'm starting from scratch, why would I start from scratch at like the next level up versus the next next level up? And again, that's that's how where your awareness is. And this morning, it was one thing. I talked to two guys. I talked to someone who just came from Cardone, uh, who I thought was more tech ops, so it's actually marketing ops. And then I talked to someone who was, uh, doing some over at publishing and like sameish person. But like I'm trying to navigate what does that role even look like? And interesting to hear from those guys what is working over there at some of those companies because it does sound a bit hybridy. And it's like, and then oh this you'll find this interesting. Uh the one of them was talking about how because you only have a handful of players that you I would categorize as like info coaching that have reached like mass scale and stayed there. So your Tony's, your grants, your you know that realm of people have stayed there. There are plenty of people that do over 10 million a month right now that I haven't even heard of, but they're more offer style, not more like right. The other play that some of these guys are making is they're hiring in like private equity data people, private equity CFO people that come from that space so that you're almost like backfilling the things you don't know about how to make it exitable. Interesting. How does your data need to look? How do your numbers need to look? What is attractive? What you know because then you just when it's time if ever again 0.01% know 1% chance. I understand, but like if you just need your like why wouldn't you build it in a way if that's the goal so that your model just plops out and imports directly into theirs and how you do all your like you have all the red flags and things they're going to check already completely done on the front end. It's like that process of when you want to do it and then you get an investment banker and they go through and do all this. It's like what if you're just built like that? What if you just operate like that? You operate like a port co company of a private equity company before you before you are one. Yeah, it's interesting because like you say 0.1 0.1%. And it's true but like I would say in this space 0.1% of companies would do that. It's like nobody even try does it the right way, you know? It's like so so like if you do it the right way like what is the percent like I don't think agree because nobody's actually done it. No, I mean I had three or four off the top. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. So, the one guy who tried it did it. So, maybe that's Yeah. No, but uh yeah, there's there's some other big names that I know that got up to size and basically tried like started to talk about doing it and started to get in the direction of it. I know one of them that sold for like five. I know another one I know some guys that are actually in the um 5x. No, for like five mil in total. Five mil in total. Yeah, I think we're Moses numbers was 45 55 somewhere in that range uh that they sold there. I think um and they did other and again then it's all down to deal structure and they had to they kept X amount and they did like I don't I don't know I don't know any of that no one knows directly but the model of building it to this size and selling it I don't know where it's been done or if the business just changes out of info coaching and goes into like supplements like the the example the other company that was in our space that uh got to serious size they moved to over 80% they started as info coaching and over 80% by What's that one called? I know what I'll tell you off. I'll tell you off. Tell me off. But I think I know it's it was an offer like yours and then it went to supplements, right? Yeah. And it was over 80% of their stuff was supplements in the tail. And they ended up, you know, and and yeah, they publicly posted around whatever and then it got ended up being sold and it was like this whole thing and they had just built it and just grinded and cooked on this thing and like crushed it and it just got to a point of like complexity, cost, rise, how the thing I don't I don't have all the details, but they ended up getting out of it. but not getting out of it to my understanding at the level of where they maybe could have or where if it was structured in a little bit different way it could have and I don't have the context fully but those guys like that's all that's the not saying them but like that idea of where we're we're we're taking on all this extra everything to go for this dream of being able to do this and what you give up in terms of literal cash and time and focus and how you build and not just like having fund and just cash and just like cash flowing it. What you give up to get here and then not achieving that when you get there is like oh boy. Especially Especially when you just like look at um if you just put that if you just put that in the S&P 500 and waited 15 years like it would have been and cash flow. Exactly. If you would have heavy cash flowed it. So Iman talks about this. He he literally has and I quote said and I've talked to him one-on-one about stuff like I paid for his I pay for his stuff. I pay for what everyone's everything. But he literally was like, I would rather run one that does, you know, three million in profit on 5 million in topline total than I would one that does, you know, 15 million a year with like five or six million. He's like all day. Like he's the one who he loves that model of the 70 80% profit margin like stay in this pocket. They do a lot of stuff organic which is where you lose the 30 40% depending, right? just like right off the rip. If you don't have if you can't do it through organic, it's just 30% of your margin's gone. You know, your 3x is but but like I don't think I don't think what he's done is like it's not very um like most people will never do that where I think like with paid ads, it's a lot easier for someone to get to 5 million profit, let's say, than agreed. Agreed. Yeah. And and I think his piece more so was around the which I think you're doing a very very good job at. So like yes you bite 30% or whatever number on ads on your marketing side of things but how you then operate within your fulfillment and your team and everything in that way is lean. You look at someone like us we are hammering both of them. Yeah. Yeah. So, like we, you know, call it 30% just for because how we're saying it here. Uh, which it's not, by the way, everyone. Um, but it's 30% is ad then you have we have a heavy fulfillment side and then over top of this because these have gotten so large. We have a heavy overhead side because I have an HR director. I have a talent acquis an exper talent experience manager. I have, you know, 200 software bills. All your software bills for like Oh my gosh. Yeah. Hubspot and Zoom and Calendarly and whatever. You add these up and it's like, dude, our Zap account got to a point where I think it was like eight grand a month and I was like, what is happening? And I I literally was like, what is happening that I'm paying Zap 100 grand a month for what is likely like this happened and this happened, but because we do so much volume everywhere, it just ran up the bill. That's exactly what it was. We had a coaching, we built a custom coaching analytics tool in the back end, so we could audit that our coaches were fulfilling on because we had so many coaches. So we were auditing if that like made sense and like or if what they were doing if they were saying this it was AI inlay like layered through is the sentiment in there are they saying these things is the call length acceptable for what they should be for how you know they have 70 calls so you have 4,000 calls that'll happen one to one in a month then you have another 4,000 which is actually like a thousand because then it's the groupish version right like it kind of like segments in but you go across all these and it's like 5,000 plus calls that are going to happen just with clients and then you're going to have whatever 4,000 calls are going to happen on sales and all of these are existing within Zoom. You have your like cloud recording built. Where are you going to store those? How are you going to analyze all those? And then we have messaging and all this. We're trying to like source the truth it and like three sources of truth. And I look back and it's like that one thing did 600,000 zaps of our 3 million. And I'm like what? Like and all it is is like pulling from here reformatting a little and pushing to here. So I'm thankfully on X and all stuff and I see NAND and I see this whatever. I literally send it over to a senior tech dev. He's like, "Oh, that's cool." And like, "Love like he he crushes it." But like the where our level of awareness is is like our personal best is our personal best. Is is their own personal best. We have all only done this by doing it ourselves, not by learning it elsewhere and implementing it here, right? Or coming with the experience in. It's like we're just learning as we go. So he moves it over and we save like four grand a month in Zap in like an hour and a half. What do you guys host on? What do you guys host your coaching on? We have to use uh platform. Yeah, we use trainer eyes still which is a dinosaur. So we use trainer eyes for the fulfillment level side of things because we need the exercises. We need the plug with the macronutrient and like the meal tracking. We need the habits. We need those. And now there's a bunch of these other ones. But I have 4,000 people that are in it and getting call it, you know, five, call it 50 a day. I'll never tell. But the how many are coming in a day right now? And then we have this group style thing and is it going to be on the same platform? So you're going to have two different product lines inside one fulfillment tool and you're never going to have that inside HubSpot. What that's where the coaching happens to the one-on- ones. So the one-on- ones will then happen through Zoom though. So you have Zoom. So on the on the fulfillment stack, you have Zoom, you have Calendarly to connect them. You have Jot Form for check-ins and like and submissions in in inbound. You have Trainerize for the fulfillment. You have Drive for the storage of some of the stuff. You have one another like offshoot one that we actually just canceled, but you have those and then it's like where does AI layer in? And can you does it devalue it if AI is going to the consumer? Likely, right? Because you're paying this high ticket and it's like, oh, I could just work with AI, which you can't, but like you can feed it. So, can you make efficiency where someone could have 50 clients and now they can have a hundred because of how efficiently they can operate? Like there's all these questions. I don't know. It's just it's fun. But if you look at in because where this came from is the comparison to the what Iman was saying with the model of like making three or five the level of ease now that that could happen and just like how simple and easy that looks and I know it's difficult for a lot of people I'm sure who like haven't done that but versus this and the intricacies and the HR department and the PTO and like dude like what's your goal? What's your goal? And I will hammer that home as many times as possible because if you want to make 3 to 5 million bucks a year, just like go do that. Go do that. And like it's perfectly fine where it is. And you can even push it and go much further to, you know, the likes of how you're doing it where you're keeping these costs and lean in alignment. And yes, you're using paid to fuel it, but you solve a couple more things around LTV and around that and your 2x on a company basis is a 10x and it's like why wouldn't you? Why? I mean, you you can push it and stay lean, which we have not. Yeah. at all. Like Yeah. Yeah. Our our our net margins have always been very healthy and it's it has allowed me to like take out a lot of cash from the business. So like I can do things like invest and stuff like that where I I don't feel like I need to have that exit. Like it's not I don't go that you know what I mean? Yeah. Because you can just pile it into there. You are smart on a personal level. I made a video on this. It's like vanity metrics I think is what I called it. But it's like I say, you know, we're at 74 million now. So it's like 74 in total cash. That is before fees, which are, you know, your couple points. That is before your refunds, which for us is, we're extremely liberal with those with refunds and that whole policy. It's like if someone comes in, it's not a good fit. If they have something that happens like right after the fact, they have a disagreement, they made a decision without a spouse or something, like we want them to actually make that decision. But if there's then an issue where it like actually like no, get out like, you know, we give money, we give back to that. So before refunds, then it hits here. Now you have your sales which is you know 10 to 20% depending on your stack. You have your fulfillment cost which on one coaching is another 20 points. You have your marketing which 30% if you're on a 3x. And like now you're sitting here and that's what is now contribution to overhead. And it's like what is your overhead stack? And then all of a sudden you have W2 so your whole team is 20% more. And then you have all this stuff and it shakes out and call it you know a good a good online biz we'll just say is 30 right? A good one. the amazing ones and the organic ones are 60 and somewhere in that range and you start to get scary when you're like under 20 in my opinion right in those ranges. Then for our example, you have partners. So you have multiple owners because they were co-founders. I came in as a co-owner different than co-founder, right? Then once it hits you, so your beauty of this and I don't know your whole stack, but like you know as a 100% owner. So you have all this that happens and then it hits you. Then how you have chosen to live as a person is in a tax-free zone. So now you keep you know a majority of that or whatever the math is. We lose then 30 40 you know you can play that game but 30 40% if you're US just rough math. then now how do you live your lifestyle? And it's like what actually hits to where you're going to put it in an S&P and do that? It's like it is it's not 71 or $74 million, right? And like so many people are like, "Oh, they made 74 million." It's like, bro, I just said right here, let's call it 20 that hits profit. Then you have partners and then you have your personal like tax and it's like or you just crank it high and like for what? for all of this work for 120 people working 30 to 70 hours a week depending on the person and the time and the season and what's hot and broken and whatever. I don't know. It's just it's what's the goal? It's what's the goal? Is that like when you started did you did you think about that at all or has it just been like no no it's just been I still barely think about that. I still am like I am I am such in the hamster wheel of my own creation. Like I always like I always send to my friends. They're like, "Oh, let's go do this." And I'm like, "No, like I'm at this desk 16 hours a day right now." More. No joke. 5:00 a.m. to I mean I finished that video last night at it was ready and published at like 10:30, 11 p.m. And like I went to the gym for 45 and I'll eat in between randomly on meetings or whatever. I have one directly after this, another one after that. Like and I'm just go go go go go go in this season on purpose. But when I started this, I was doing sales page builds for this company as one of two or three things I was doing. We had a conversation on how do we take this to 10 million, which sounded insane at the time cuz Ovenans was like the poster child and he was doing 30 mil and then it came out and he even said that they were doing a million or I think it was a million or three million 1 to three million in profit on 30 cuz he got an office and did this whole thing and like was ramping scale and then went into the more organic side of things because he was all paid and that was a huge portion of it and then huge team. Exactly what we did, right? We went from 10 to 30 and our margins like percentage went like this and the dollars went like this. Yeah. Right. I think that's the best piece of advice you can give that like someone who's starting can take from this is like like exactly as you said, what's your goal? Because once you start and get into one of these things, it's very hard to like change your mind three years. It's almost impossible. And what happens when it goes wrong? Yeah. Yeah. And like actually goes wrong like like you bleed out goes wrong because you don't understand things or you get to a point and like what you have 3,000 coaches or 3,000 clients and you need to service on contracts and like did you put away the cash because that's not a that's not info. That's not cash in cash out a login access and like you know pay your 299 Kajjabi bill so they can get it forever for lifetime and like you just have to bite that. It's the servicing of clients and did you put the cash in the in a bucket over here for the two and a half million you owe to coaches over the next 12 months you already accepted cash on is it like these different things and that the company that we're you know referring to my understanding fulfilled on all those contracts and halted everything else in order to do that. So they had to put x amount of bucket of cash to continue to pay team even after accepting no new clients. Yeah. Right. So it's like if they didn't put that away and again no shade on them at all. It's just like that's the model. That's the same thing we're in. We're like we were having these massive decreases. We're paying, you know, the payroll is up because it's paying for people who we already acquired within the last 12 months. So, the payroll is, you know, essentially staying here. Every time you bring someone new in, it's a,000 or 3,000, whatever you pay a coach over a year that you need to just put in a bucket and you're already at break even. So, so you decided that today you wanted to like stop the business like you have at minimum six months of servicing people still where like if you have an e-commerce business Yeah. 11 stop shipping you stop shipping products tomorrow you ship out everything in the next week or two and you're pretty much done. Yeah, exactly. And you keep your email you keep your Gmail access so you can respond to your CS stuff and make sure everything's whatever and like you know some final things but you can shut down the whole front end overnight and you don't have any really costs. That's it. Yeah. other than like softwares whatever but yeah like like exactly as you said you're when you get the cash you have to pay you've accepted fulfillment on that for the next 6 months sometimes it's even 12 months yeah and the original oven's model was lifetime access and that's how he taught everyone that's how we sold it so I I go into this in some of the videos but initially when we moved to a call funnel we sold uh like the classic Kajjabi group coaching through group like like coaching calls not group coach group coaching calls, which is very different than like one person who has a cohort of 30 to 50 or whatever style thing and like multiple cohorts and they can have up to 500 that like go to them but it's you know three coaching calls a week that are two hours long a community access and a course and we sold that for a,000 and up to 1500 over the phone and we were just doing volume and that's how we did but we sold that over the phone because we didn't know how to sell it direct to card closes. We were 10% 150. Yeah. At that point, I think it was eight I want to say at that point. Um but they were doing so much volume like we had closers making 300 grand a year, 400 grand a year. We were just really That's on on a 1500 offer. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. And we I mean we did that's how we did 10 and 12 million was on that offer. And we didn't even again we we started with an with a low ticket that we didn't have and as we all know now and so obvious is we didn't have the ascension ladder built. So there was no ascension. So it was like the economics had to be on an MR basis basically. So it's like how did the MR feed LTV to CAC like that it was that formula and we didn't know how that operated and we didn't have enough data around it to know what it was. Then we went to info we started selling it at $500 over the phone when we started and then like within two months upped it to a,000 and then three months later upped it to 1500 and pay plans and all that kind of stuff. I mean, if I go back in our stripe, it's like our MR through pay plans was like 500 and some grand like just slang in that thing. And we did uh 10 and then 12 just selling
