# we send 6.8M emails a month... (full $$ system breakdown)  | E43
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bstGqHmEfM

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we send emails that actually convert into dollars. We send hundreds of thousands of emails a day. And I'm going to do a full breakdown of our email funnel, the workflows, the campaigns, and the technical sauce behind it, which is super important, and then give you the content and context of where these live within our funnel, so you can copy paste this system and get the same results. We have done 70 million in info and coaching, 30 million of which was in the last year. And I am not selling anything. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, these right here, so notice the 15% open rate. That's cuz we sent it out this morning. Um, so there's like a real screenshot right now. Uh, we are sending these twice a day to 106,000 and growing on our lead list and getting 40% open rates. Okay. So, for us, I just want to explain, everything is a funnel. I always say this, the goal here is to get someone an email to deliver, someone to open it, someone to click it, and then do set action, convert. So whether that's become an, you know, become a client, uh, buy something direct, whatever. That's a simple funnel. Okay. Now, we're going to get directly into these workflows and just go through this fast. So for us in a VSSL call funnel, you're going to have an opt no app. So somebody who opts into the funnel and to watch the training, but then does not apply. You're going to have the next, which is someone who applies but then does not book. You're going to have a successful booking and booking nurture and I'll break those down. You're going to have a post-purchase and then you're going to have a re-engage. There are plenty of more, but these are like the core ones. Okay, so looking at these op no app, how we're going to frame this and send this. You are going to initially send them the training replay and there are tons of people who go like really in-depth in this and it's in like every VSSL course, but you're going to send them a training replay. You know, basically, hey, you opted in for this. Here it is. In all of our VSSLs, we have at the very end of it or if you stay to the end, you get this bonus and we have like this, you know, sexy bonus that if they stay to the end, so then we send them that and then the rest of it is awareness content of or the level of awareness they're at which is like they don't really know who we are. This is their first time in um top a funnel. So we are sending them uh content that's based on that and it's all very very content driven which I'm going to get into. That's the op no uh opt no app. The next being the app no book. Someone has applied but not booked. So, we're going to send them, did something break? Did you mean to, you know, we see that you applied, but you didn't book? Is everything okay? And then awareness in that same way. So, you can only hit them with so many in my opinion or our opinion uh of these like, you know, abandoned cart style thing, but that's at some level what this is. So, we go through that and then awareness content. So, they're clearly deeper in the funnel. They have the training. They've already seen that. And we have a couple other pages that are very similar to this. And then from there, you're going to go to the booking success. I have a full video on the channel where I talk about uh our entire call confirmation sequence and how that works. But we send these actually from the SP and it's going to be like a confirmation you're booking uh you know get them excited. Make sure you watch XYZ pages and then the SP reminders are going to come in dynamic that are going to be based on the time of the call 3 hours before whatever. I have an complete video on there that you can see the show rate video on my channel and then booking nurture. This one is going to be also in that um in that video, but it's going through basically like the hammer them Jeremy Haynes uh video. So, he's talking about how you're hitting them with objection blocks, reviews, testimonials, all this between the booking when it occurs and I'm sorry, when the booking is actually booked and then when the call occurs. Okay, so these are super important. And then post-purchase, these ones just have like, you know, insane engagement, insane open rates. Uh so, it's just like really good to for the email reputation and uh domain. So this great decision, you know, hype up email, avoid buyer remorse, and then access onboard. All right. So now we're going to go into the campaigns, which is what these are right here. So for campaigns, we are sending two a day, every day. All right. And these are going to these 30-day opens. So inside, we use HubSpot, but inside you're going to have 30-day uh availability to see who opened your emails, clicked them, and gave like all these different stats. So, for us right now, this is the one that's working best. We have 30-day open plus 90-day click, which is obviously going to be overlap. So, someone who clicked has a higher intent than someone who just opened. So, you're just going to assume, right? So, you have 30-day opens plus 90-day clicks, and then you're excluding any buyers because all of these are content driven and content web style content. Okay? So, what I mean by that, almost all of these emails that are in here are nondirect like CTA. Every single one is hey you know XYZ sales copy portion basically info sales copy and then hey go watch it here and it's pushing them to a page on site. Now we did a we worked hard to make sure that we had a content web in place which a lot of people don't have you know who are just like running an offer. They have like a three-page website. We built ours to be hundreds of pages of different content pieces that hit people in different places and spaces um of like their journey. Okay. So we have in ours you know the three or four different buckets of health are like the messaging angles and then we have content within each of them. So everything from like how much does it cost to um you know training around for us you know menopause or macronutrient or you know these different buckets and works the same way in internet marketing works the same way in make money online space. You just need what are the messaging things and then walkthroughs. So we push them to the site as valuedriven. We get them to consume content on site and then have more recommended under it. So they just get in this web of consuming more and more content ending up on a testimonial all buried with CTAs. And a majority of these are going to drive applications because that's where we push them. We never push someone direct. The the automations are where you're going to do the contextual stuff like push them to um a booking for example or push them to something uh else. But the application is like the main CTA that's all over the site and then is also the main CTA that'll come through the emails. Okay. the automations pick up for where you want someone to book directly and that also helps when you're using routing and things like uh qualifiers because you need to route them to a DQ versus like a quality booking and you need to do that through an application or through what you have it stored in the CRM which I don't need to go into that too too much but technical side of things. This is where we're going to spend most of the time. So before I get into this I am no pro. Uh Trey Ericson is like really really good at this. He owns Mail Genius I think he bought and then email deliverability and some other stuff. um met him at a couple uh mastermind or like event stuff and he's like a really nice guy. We've also paid him multiple times um to implement some of this for us because we had issues when Google updated their promo strat and like all that. So for a quick explainer on this, I'm not sure if I did this yet, but the these are the two a day emails. So email so like yesterday email one, email two, these are going to a campaign list. Now, we technically have a million1 contacts in our uh CRM, but the 30-day open, 90-day click, no buyer list is only 106,000. Okay? So, in this re-engage sequence, and I could make a whole video on this, but you're essentially recapturing and grabbing the people that fell off this list and getting them to engage. So you're sending a super low volume. So you're not nuking the which I'll get into the technical part of the domain sender, but you are sending to these people or to the people who are not in this list and then trying to get them to re-engage. And that's why this is increasing. So it's both new leads and then re-engage because we have call it 2,000 emails going out a day to people that fell off this list to try and get them back asking a question. Hey, you know, we just rolled out this new thing. Uh you know, test question mark as a subject line. We test different stuff all the time. Um, but the goal is to just stay, you know, get open rates basically because as soon as they get an open or a click, they come back into the main list and then you can email the same and then, you know, it's it's a hotter pocket. So that's the whole goal of the re-engage, but these are our stats right now for our campaigns. Um, which is actually crazy because our automations right now are less than this, which is, you know, not really normal in my opinion. Um, so we're working on that right now, but these are the daily we send out every day, twice a day. Okay. Now, Troy Crushes, we paid him for a bunch of these different pieces, but we're going to get into it right now. So, footer sauce. What I mean by this, and I don't want to show exact like technicals because it has like, you know, private information in it, but for our footer on ours, we were told that the info versus like sales copy percentage on the overall email is a big determining factor on where it delivers in general. like so either like if it's going to go to primary versus promo and then also um if it just like the deliverability in general and then how they view it how much spam it has. So you can use tools like mail meteor for spam checker um and it'll tell you like spammy versus promotional versus whatever type content. There's a bunch of tools out there these email guys like go way down a rabbit hole and you can go on you know nothing held back Facebook group. There's a ton of those and uh email guys in there. So, this is not meant to be like the there are smarter people that do this, but or are better at this and know this space better than I do. Um, I'm just talking about like our experience. So, info versus sales. So, the goal is to get that info portion up way larger than the sales portion. And when you do that, it looks like a more info, more real email and then delivers to primary more often is like the general gist. Now, I'm sure there's like, you know, 80 20% and this and that and like, but we just don't Yeah, I just don't have that info. So, for this two different ways you can do this. um that we've done it. One is just like make your actual emails better in terms of like info versus like sales copy and crazy stuff like you still want them to convert. So you got to dance that line, but the other way is putting stuff into your footer. So, one of the things that was recommended that I saw online and then that Troy implemented for us and some other stuff is uh putting in the footer like sections of your terms or like company bio and information and doing that because that's like all pure info and then having it way smaller on the bottom and then also customizing out that section in the bottom of your footer to be like haven't applied yet or you know want to become an XYZ you know client click here to apply then it's bio information then it's whatever like just like basic information that is smaller and all the way on the bottom not part of the main copy and then that will offset the info to sales percentage and should get you better open or get you better like you know in the right inbox basically uh rates. So I said spam checker technical side of things uh dedicated IP once you get to a certain level it makes sense to have one of these where I mean like this entire thing is like the the simply put way is if you look at your open rates your click rates or whatever and like things are good like that's what you're basing this off if you have a 10% open rate and like a 2% click rate like something's wrong. Okay. And when I say a funnel the first thing you need to optimize for are they getting delivered. So you'll have a little delivery percentage. Ours is like 99%. Are you getting opens? If you're getting 10%, that's where it broke. So, now you need to fix that. Why are you not getting opens? Is it your subject? Um, is it your subject line? Is it your uh who you're sending from? Is it the that's landing in the wrong inbox? It's going to junk. It's somewhere there. That's how you solve for that. Next one. If you're not getting a click, it's the email copy. It's how it's written. It's how it's framed. It's how it is uh, you know, just valuable enough. It's just like, you know, you're not offering something good enough. And then, do they convert? Once you get them to the page, is the page then doing the action with the copy, with the video, with the whatever to get them to the next step, which generally is an application, uh, or to book a call. Okay? So, like you need to look at everything like a funnel if you're look if or I look at everything like a funnel. You don't necessarily have to, but like it's very easy to solve this way. If you're not getting deliverability, technical issue, if you're not getting opens, subject line or um, you know, another technical issue with like how it's being delivered plus, right? Um, if you're not getting clicks, it's in the email copy. If you're not getting converts, it's in the page, right? So like thinking about it like that, same way you think about copy. Headline sells a sub headline, sub headline sells the next, right? Like that's how you do this. So we moved to a dedicated IP within HubSpot after we got to a certain volume. We send like I have to look, but like last I look it was over five million emails a month. So we moved to a dedicated IP with them and it helps. It basically puts you so you're not on a shared setup. So you your data is only your um or like your reputation is only based on your reputation, not on a shared setup. Um so this can be very very helpful for tracking. We use Hyros and HubSpot. So HubS like you have to think about it as like how much like who has the data. So Hyros has it. We put uh we append in the URL like a Hyros parameter and the email and you can look up on Hyro stuff how they do this but basically it'll track it so you can see if they came from email somewhere in the buyer journey so you can run lastclick reports on like what did these emails generate when you know all time if they clicked on an email what happened with them throughout the buyer journey. So we use Hyrosse for like the overall buyer journey track but inside HubSpot you have to look at like what data do you have in there. So they have the email clicks, they have the page views, they have all the contact info, they have the actions they take uh and they also have deals in there. So because we use deals for um our sale for the sales process inside HubSpot, you're able to when you mark a deal one, it can see that so that those uh emails can have like deal revenue assigned to them. So you can see oh these emails went to that rough metric. We don't like directly use it to make decisions. Um, but it is it it's good to see, right? It's like just good data. We don't necessarily just like rely on it. We use Hyros more for that and that's what we track week over week on clicks, opens. Um, I guess clicks and opens and all that come from HubSpot. But in Hyros is where we get it where what happens with the actual action and where is it on the buyer journey. Brand sending versus solo sending. Um, so I said in here for brand, these are all branded emails. So we'll send from you know brand name at or you know expertname at companyame.com. That's where all these will send. These right here will send direct from the sales rep which you can do dynamically inside HubSpot. Um but you just want to make sure like so for example you'll have like you know Ryan companyame.com is the one that sends all the mass emails. So there's 5 million emails that go out from this. We use a support at for like kind of the main there. You can do a bunch of stuff if you want with like reply twos, especially if you have SDRs that manage inboxes. And then when you do these like workflows or dedicated side off ones that are lower in the funnel, like a booking success, you can then dynamically put the contact owner in as a sales rep and that's how we do it. Okay? So that does not conflict or have issues. Um, and that's what gets us these results. And then Google Postmaster, um, you can really go down a rabbit hole here, but Google Postmaster, you'll be able to see IP reputation, delivery errors, domain reput, like just lights them up basically green, yellow, red, and then percentages. and it'll just tell you like how are you doing over 7day all the way up to like I believe 120 or 180 day. Um so we use this all the time and ours is like perfectly clean now and that it was not for a long time. Um and then yeah promo versus primary is kind of like a final check thing. We've had people come in and do it before and like in the end they just send themselves a test email and look at it. So like that's still what we do. So we'll send it to ourselves as a test email and see where it pops in promo versus primary and a lot of that comes back to this content that exists within here. Okay. So, someone had asked me to make this video. So, I hope this is helpful. I've already done a bit on this, but I just want to go a little bit deeper into like our technical setup. Um, I can get more stats on this and if you want like hit me on X or something and I can give more detail of what you're kind of looking for specifically with email. Yesterday, we did 106,000 cash collected with 15 high ticket and 52 low ticket. low ticket is still low um because we have not been able to scale up with the CPA which is not good uh because the goal is to get this like you know in the hundreds and if we can't scale it you know past 50 we need to work on some things before we can do so uh but this is backing out like insane and then high ticket that's a pretty solid number for us for the amount of calls that we booked so in the six figs which is good now we just need to maintain it over x amount of time and obviously we crushed at the end of the night last night like 10 something this Eastern so I made a dock I broke ClickFunnels so I don't I don't know how to fix this with the www eas easily, but www.rronclawet.com/docck. I have every single video. I'm on day 42 or 43 or something like that of making these in a row. Uh, and you can go here and you can see like what the main idea is. The title is always changing, so it's sometimes hard to know. So, I just put a main idea, link to the YouTube video, and then the category. So, you can filter by category and see like, oh, I just want the tech stuff. Oh, I just want marketing. Oh, I just want sales. Um, but yeah. So, on here as well, there's a topic request form if you want to fill that out. So, hope this was valuable. A little bit different one today that's kind of like more technical and a little bit like, you know, it's clouds and dirt. So, hope it was helpful and talk to you guys
