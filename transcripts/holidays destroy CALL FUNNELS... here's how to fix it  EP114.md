# holidays destroy CALL FUNNELS... here's how to fix it | EP114

In today's video, we're going to be talking about how holidays affect info coaching, specifically when you are using call funnels. All right, so today is Fourth of July, so we're going to go through some of the core holidays that suck the most, the main effects these have on your business, ways to mitigate against these direct effects, and then ways to actually flip them on their head, and ways to get upside from having these holidays. And just some quick math on this. So, figured it was on par to do this today as it is 4th of July, and it's also like 10:15 p.m. because I forgot to do this. So, let's get into it. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 78 million in total cash collected and I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is sharing what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people building cool stuff. All right, so like I said, today's 4th of July. I'm doing this one late. I'm going to try and keep it short and sweet. But some of the core holidays Oh no, that's not good. What are the core holidays that are the worst? Fourth of July, Christmas. Now there's also seasonality. So depending on your business model, like we're in fitness for example. So if you use like a New Year's when we get into upside, like there is tons of this, but there's also a massive lull, right? So like coming into the new year, Christmas for example, like the big thing with call funnels and long weekend holidays, is there is no availability on your team's calendar, which is how much you and your team is working. So how much coverage you have on the actual calendar. So let's say, let's use like very simple numbers. So let's say you have 50 normal slots a day that are available on these weekends. On weekends in general, it's actually very very common to have like 30 or like 25 uh on weekends and you need to like manage availability, have different like uh schedules for your uh closers. Um but in terms of availability, it'll drop aggressively like to 25%. So if you had 100 normally, you'll have 25 over the weekends. Like right now, if I look at ours, we have half, let's just say, um availability from the reps. Um, so you there are ways to mitigate this and this is like a management of people thing that we haven't done a fantastic job of. So that's one side of it and then the other side of it um is people actually booking in and willing to book in. So today is the 4th of July. Tomorrow and the next day people are partying the entire weekend. Our demo is 40 to 60 and they have families and they're doing stuff so they just like don't even want to get on a call. So it's like people aren't working and people don't want to book a call and you're spending into the weekend. So show rates even the people who do book things come up, people get busy, people can't talk. So then show rates tank to the floor. Teamwork. I think that's the same thing I meant with availability. And then overspending. This is like I get into the math on this, but if you're spending X amount across this range and you want to try and spend down to only fill the calendars, you either are going to overspend, which is generally what we lean into doing versus opportunity cost of the other way around. Because the opportunity cost on the other side is you start to throttle down your spend and then you fill only into this and you try and ramp back up by the time Monday rolls around to fill calendars and you only fill 50% of calendars on Monday because you're trying to like nickel and dime it and save costs versus just spending into pocket. Now, this is specifically an issue for call funnels. Okay? So, if you're running direct to cart, this is like I don't run direct to cart uh very much. So I'm actually going to talk about that today cuz like for example we have over 50 units on low ticket today which is direct to cart but on the back end of the low ticket is ascension through booking with setters booking with closers. So like we still feel this availability it's just like second and third order consequence. So ways to mitigate this that we have seen so we will do bonus pay for the team working portion. So we use a point-based system for um like basically bonus pools on the tail end uh for closers. So they have like commission rates that they have. I have other videos where I talk about this, but we have um a base level commission that's like tranches based on their performance and then we have this bonus pool that sits that exists within whatever pay period. So some people do it monthly, ours is um bi-weekly, so it's the Saturday, I'm sorry, Sunday to the following Saturday. So every two weeks. So we'll have a bonus pay uh pool. Um that basically means that when they work on these holidays or when they work on certain weekends, they get an additional 50% of uh of uh points. So we'll do bonus points of 1.5x. So, if you collect 10k cash, you actually get 15,000 points instead of 10. Okay, we will run specials. This is a pretty good one, and I'm going to go into this here, but we This is kind of like for the much much bigger holidays. So, specials, and I'm going to use one of Iman's things here, but he calls them revenue generating events. So, we will create revenue generating events around the big ones. So, I'll talk about this a little bit later, but we use them around here, and we actually use them around uh 4th of July, too. Um, but I'm going to get into that. So we don't use them on the front end for those. Um direct to cart huge way to offset this in my opinion. Um so if you have something you can do direct to cart you don't have the issue where kind of the spending buckets have to change. It's more so on that second and third order consequence of the availability. So making sure that you have team coverage for the pieces because like if I look here we have 40 calls that have been booked today uh on 4th of July through the back end of a direct cart. So we have basically direct to cart sold through then booked calls under the back end. availability was there for them to book into it, but then the calls then happen throughout the weekend into Monday. Um, actually not Monday to Sunday because we have 48 hour booking window. So, this is a good one. And then another just like very obvious one that we don't get to take advantage of that a lot of people do is international. So, because we almost like predominantly sell to North America because our fulfillment is also North America because we sell coaching. It's oneonone and we don't have international coaches. So, then it's kind of silly to sell international clients because of the time zones. But international, like I was on a meeting this morning and nobody even knew that it was Fourth of July because again they are not US-based so it wasn't that big of a deal and then I just jokingly pray. I don't know because we've had terrible ones like think about a business where you have or you're in bad months and you have like a 10% margin. You have three days. 3 days of your 30 days of the month is your entire margin. And like that's not actually how the math works. That's like very very simply put and like kind of a stupid way to look at it. But like it can be bad if you have like 20k days. We're at I'm going to give you exact numbers because I don't care today. Uh we're at 75 grand on the day which isn't like terrible for us. Um but we were at I mean we're over half a million into the month and it's the fourth. Yeah. So we were doing like 150k days and then we just got cut in half today because of this because of 4th of July. So like a normal day for this would be like 100 plus. So yeah, not feeling great about that. Um now upside. So promo reframes. Actually I'm gonna show this whole thing just so I can break into these. So promo reframes and specials. So for specials, we will highlight around and kind of like focus on this revenue generating event style thing. So the big ones that we'll use are these. So to offset this Christmas lull and also seasonality for us, we'll ride the wave of Black Friday, Cyber Monday. And for us, we will do one that is front-facing and in so like for us, we'll have uh info coaching in the front. So like new acquisition, then we'll have retention and renewals. So for the front end uh of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, we'll do something that's like 1K off. So it's basically like you can work your pipeline and then you can also just pitch it differently. Different reps are do different things but like kind of but it's 1k off generally for there. And then we also do a massive renewal special at this time. So you're coming into the new year and we'll say hey we'll throw on we'll drop a,000 bucks off the back end or $500 or whatever the number is we choose for the year. And then we'll also do multi-year. So, an example of this is we'll go, okay, if our normal program is 7K, let's say, we'll do a 6K for renewal or we'll do an 11K for a 2-year renewal. And we'll do this and we'll give it one week throughout Black Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and we'll crank that. Now, what we're actually doing, so today's Friday, we're allowing our renewal reps to start doing this now through the weekend to kind of like bridge the gap and then we're doing this big Christmas in July that is renewal only. That is going to be a,000 off. So, we'll do one that's like a 6K, let's say, backend and then, like I said, like an 11K where you can do two years and we will hammer this for a week and we have thousands and thousands of customers. So, we'll send every email. We'll have direct toart for uh forms. We now have retention reps dedicated, so they'll talk to them because we also offer financing options um now that we want to talk them through because a big thing with us on uh financing that we found that we made the mistake on, big mistake on was people were choosing like they were doing like their own selfch checkckout basically on financing. So they would finance for 24 months on a 12-month program, which like really hurts future renewals, and we don't want to do that. So, we do have some internal pay plans, but usually almost exclusively when we'll do any of these um promos or like specials like this, we will do um only on PIFFs. So, we won't do like payment plans that are there because then it just messes with cash collection because it's like, okay, you're going to take a what was 72 or 7,000 or whatever program, you'll make it 6K, then you're going to split that 6K over a four pay that's actually whatever what is that 1.5. So, you'll do like a 1.8K 4 pay. And it's just like cash collection gets all wonky even on renewals. and we would rather just push all the cash forward and then we know all we have is a coach and then maybe some renewal cash that we pay. Sometimes we'll do a coaching contest. So, we'll do one internal for that as well. Um, and I'll do a whole video on this actually once we finish this because we're starting it on Monday. So, we'll uh have a nice influx from there. But, if we can get call it, what's simple math? Um, call it 500 renewals um at you know 6K like that doesn't suck. and they're at, you know, 80 plus percent margin because cost to fulfill is in pocket and uh renewals and all that kind like or commissions and all that stuff don't exist. There's no CPA, there's no none of that stuff. Um so yeah, so these are really big events for us for like revenue generating events, but it has to be used correctly. And again, we only do these on like the big core ones. Uh these other ones that just like bleed us out are these long weekend holidays. So like uh what's another one? What's like Memorial Day for example? like people just don't want to take calls and so people don't want to work and then people also don't want to book calls. So if you don't have something to offset that with direct toart or something that you can piggy back off that's like a revenue generating event just expect to lose your ass for 3 days basically. Um so we will do this big thing where we hammer uh on group renewals and again we'll have some where we do new and we'll have somewhere do renewal. So it's also like 11 p.m. right now or I'm sorry it's 10:30 right now. So, excuse my thing on here, but some of the quick math on this, and this is very, very obvious, but I just wanted to like show. So, what we'll do is we'll overspend. So, we will have where I'm just using very simple math here, but if you're going to spend 10 G's for 50 bookings at $200 a booking, I think that math is right. Brain's off. Yeah, that's right. Um, so you'll have this and then what'll happen is you'll only have availability/people working for like 20, let's say. Um, so like sub 50%. And you will spend the same amount. So you'll spend in. Now you technically get all the leads, you get all the apps, people book later. Oh, you know, it's almost like a scarcity thing. It's like, oh, they don't see spots available, but kind of not. So like you just have to really make sure that you're retargeting, your emails, your setters, your whatever are in pocket coming out of the weekend to make sure they hit all these people because you're still spending the same amount. So it's not like you still are going to get the leads and apps that you can monetize on. Um, but yeah, so it's kind of the general gist um what I'm trying to get through. This was just funny. But um we're doing okay today. I'll be very interested to see. Um, usually the actual holiday itself is the worst day, but this is a tough one with a full weekend like this where Fourth of July is Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. So, we'll see what we come out. If we can keep above 75 100k days, like that'll be great. And then we will be on par or on pace for record month. Uh, our record month was actually last year in this month of July and we did 3.7 and like high ones. So it was like I think it was 1.7 came from renewals and then we had two that were from new. So 1.7 was renewals. Um two was new and then what we're what we've been pacing right now is like 2.5 plus in new. So if we can get to three in new and then try and go for two in renew that would be a dream. So if we can hit that then we'll hit our first five month. And again, this was our record ever month. Um, so that would be fantastic for us. And then again, this is very high margin. And then this is getting much more. This is getting much healthier. So, a lot of costs on this. And I can go into other videos on the cost models I have on here. Um, but we have sales now pretty in pocket as a percentage. CPA is dropping. Uh, and we're getting that in pocket, but we are increasing team on that side of things. So, like again, I'm also just in this hamster wheel kind of rat race of getting these numbers to a point where it drops 30 plus% margin, which we have not achieved in a minute. And those are kind of like healthy margins. So, you guys like on me and are like, "Oh, like drop the margin, drop the margin." Like, of course, I tell you we do 3 million. I tell you guys that these are tight margins. I tell you that these things, it was real tight when it was 1.5. It's like healthier and like all good now that it's three. Um, or that we've done 3 million the last two months. But when you have these piggybacked or multiple inside a month, you also have the seasonality of just summer in general sometimes depending on your market. So like we'll have, you know, again, we have 46-year-old women. Um, so sometimes we'll have seasonality over a summer where I don't really like to believe in seasonality and I think you can offset that with direct to cart because there's the other thing like Super Bowl for example, like people won't take calls, show rates will drop to the floor, but like your direct toart will crush because they'll be sitting there on their phone and they're willing to buy something or opt in or do whatever. Um, it's just actually getting on the phone to take the call. So, you just have to like optimize around pockets of that stuff. So, hopefully this is helpful. Kind of shorter video, 13 minutes today, but is what it is. All right, it's late. So, links, info, coaching, doing a survey on here. If you guys want to fill this out, you don't have to put in your contact info if you don't want to, but I'm just trying to figure out where everyone's at. Drop some comments on this. Uh, I'm on day I don't know, 114. I think I'm going to stop at 120 or not stop, but change over to two a week or three a week. I have some really good interviews coming up um with some cool cool people. So, and I have some cool people in DM that I think I'm going to uh I think they're going to get it's going to be very valuable uh some of the good ones. So, um doc right here will have all these videos. I have an update in this in a minute, but this has all the OG videos I did for the first hundred or something days that are very very technical or very kind of like structured and op sales marketing tech mindset those broken down. Uh I did put together a little rolodex thing that has different linked out to different vendors that I have used or you know 100% trust. So like Watt for financing for example. Um they have some cool deals. I think this is has a special thing on it link on it. I don't know. Can't confirm. So um LeadFi for uh getting income qualification data on leads and feeding the pixel. This one's hot. This one works a lot. Um Hyro Classic, ClickFunnels classic. And then vendor wise, I have some really good sales vendors. I actually have two of these now. agency vendors that I uh I didn't realize that somebody that I worked with uh on this uh has a really really good one of these and they had actually used like people I work with had used them as a sales agency and I didn't realize that's who was behind it. So uh pretty cool there. And then the main guy that I talked to about this but again you guys have to DM me with like a bunch of contacts to make sure you fit. For example, sales guys do 100k a month people who have 5k offers. It's when it works best for them. Marketing guys, I have media buyers. I have agencies there. um offer guys. These guys crush that just build out giant low tickets and also just uh will do basically like expert positioned um offer publishing style stuff. Um so, you know, I talk about this one sometimes, but Josh is like one of these. I have a couple of these um credit card thing. 5 to 10% cash back on ad spend that crushes. I connected a couple people with these guys and they got all set up and cruising along on there systems, all the things. So, I appreciate you guys. Um I'm going to do a Q&A tomorrow. So, tomorrow if you go to here, and I'll uh post this on X as well. Um, but if you go here, you can fill out this request form. It's basically just like just plug in a question, give me some context so I can answer it public because I think those are better than the DM ones sometimes. But as long as you give me enough context and don't, you know, write a novel so I can read it kind of publicly and it makes sense. Um, but then I will be able to give you some help. And a couple of those people have responded and said that we two, four, 5x their business um just by some quick tweaks. Taking them from 20K to 40K, taking them from 10K to 100K. Um and then some of the bigger guys, you know, you get a two to 5% lift and that's hundreds of thousands of dollars potentially to bottom line or topline. So, appreciate you guys and I will talk with you soon. Have a happy and safe weekend. I am.
