## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1AQpWco3rU

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing a quick event recap of the AFL Manor Mastermind, which is an event thrown by Iman. There's three days of good info, a lot of takeaways, some cool people. So, I'm going to give you a quick recap of that, and then we're going to do a Q&A live with Luke, co-founder, and Miruse, who's our media buyer. So, if there's some audio in the background, I'm sorry. All right. Not a normal video. We've done around 76 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. Not here to sell you anything. Everything on the channel is just showing what has worked for us and what has not worked for us. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities and building a cool network of people doing cool [ __ ] especially in info coaching. All right, so kick things off. Day one was all around seuite culture. Um, so his entire seuite is essentially like a big core piece of the offering. Um, so part of AFL. So you get access to them uh in a group setting. Um, there's calls with them, a lot of recorded content of them. But during the event, they shared a ton of stuff about how they operate, uh, marketing, sales, content, product, all those things. Uh, and they were really, really impressed on culture and team. They showed a bunch of good stuff. Yesterday's video, uh, I believe it was yesterday, um, I made one that was all about this and how some of the takeaways we had and how I see that playing out for us. Um, and then from there, they rolled into a detox thing, which is pretty cool. Um, a guy that's very, very extreme about this. Um, and has some crazy case studies and some crazy results. Um but yeah, it was overall it was all like overall very very good. Um and just kind of like a good intro day and then rolled into just some chill vibes. We all went out to dinner and had um you know some fun. So that was cool. Day two was much more into tactics, right? So event two was all about their launches. They're like known for their events that they do uh when inside of Educate and some of these other companies they have. Um so they went very very deep on how to do events. I'm not going to give away everything inside there. Like you can do that yourself, but that's not really I'm not here to sell anything or do anything. I don't I don't care. Um but yeah, did that and then everyone went and did sports. They were doing like clay pigeon shooting and stuff, but we had meetings, so I actually had to stay back, which was an interesting thing for me cuz I was like, "Wow, all these guys crush it and they don't have to be on meetings like this or for whatever reason, they weren't on meetings for any of these." So yeah, it was a interesting perspective shift that we're, you know, still crushing on these meetings and doing stuff and maybe we need to evolve in a certain way. So that was good. Um and then big fitness YouTuber, uh that was really really nice and cool. uh went up there and talked about his journey, his growth, kind of his lifestyle that he builds around this and doing that. And then we had a black tie event which is super fun. Each one of these nights we were up until like 4 in the morning, which is kind of crazy. It's like not my vibe or like normally what I would do, but a lot of cigars, a lot of good conversations, so I was here for it. And then day three, which is today, so it was just a few days. Uh we talked a lot of things around like M&A adviser was there. Um they were talking about a lot of like bigger moves, things to do, kind of like what you do. Iman kept saying what you do with your golden uh golden eggs that come from your golden goose. um like what do you do with those? What do you do with the cash flow that spits off? Instead of trying to think that you're ever going to sell your info coaching business, just take the cash flow, either put in investments, um go and buy put in companies, do whatever your kind of like niche specific thing is, which can be anything, right? Um so some people are super into art like he was saying, some people are super into businesses, some people are into these things. So it was around there and then Wap guys came up and talked a lot about payments and they have some crazy cool stuff that they're launching. So yeah, that's just kind of general overview. Again, I don't want to give away kind of any of the stuff that they were directly doing cuz that's not my place to do. Um, but some of the takeaways I had super interesting. The guys that were sitting next to us, um, that I had on, actually, Tan I had on here, has a very similar business model to us, but everybody else in the room almost ex like almost I'm pretty sure every single other person runs a very similar model to Iman. So, it's very organic heavy. They do launches a lot of the time. Some of them have evergreen, someone's kind of back and forth. A lot of them have direct to cart, so like info style. Some have sales calls, but then still direct to info versus coaching. Um, and if they do have coaching, it's group coaching or kind of like these really high leverage ones. Um, and some of them have retention. So, breaking these down, we're extremely paid heavy. We're evergreen, so it's kind like consistent or tries to be every day instead of these massive launches where you'll do, you know, 10 million bucks or 4 million bucks or two or whatever and then just like have LOLs. Um, direct toart, a lot of these guys are doing those then through direct toart because you're not going to have availability on sales calls and calendars that are x amount of days out. Um, and then a lot of them then will ramp with this and then have a really good retention. So, I thought that was very interesting because it's like clearly they absolutely crush it like crush it crush it because they do I mean like the Eman example, right? They'll do organic almost exclusively. They do paid now and he like leans into there a little bit and he talks about that in some of his videos. Um, they'll do these massive launches but they do still have evergreen stuff. The majority of stuff is direct to cart meaning it's going to be under whatever 2K. Um then once they're in there, they're in his ecosystem and like in that world that will have stuff on sales call kind of on the back end like AFL specific just cuz it's a higher ticket. And then they have great retention. They have great brand. They have all that kind of stuff for different products. So yeah, it was just very interesting to me to see like what pieces and parts we could do. Like some of the main things I took away from it was like organic, organic, organic. That was huge. They talked about some stuff around like revenue drivers and how they have like key events throughout the year and like make a big deal around them, which I thought was very cool cuz like it's basically like giving you permission to be able to do that in your business, whatever it is. to like have specific events or like I don't want to say promos because that's not necessarily it because it doesn't even have to be a special or like a sale. It can still just be like a big hyped up event and still be the normal price which is interesting. Same thing with on the back end. Um the direct toart stuff is very interesting cuz we still have never done anything mid ticket which is a brilliant I mean I love the idea of it. Uh if you guys go back and watch the Brooke hit video, he talks about some crazy numbers where they're selling a 1 to 2k product and then they have a 20 to 45% whatever like um uh take rate on the essentially ascension to a done with you or done for you offer on the onboarding call which is super cool. So we don't have anything built into that. We only have that for low ticket to high ticket. Um which is kind of like a vast jump. You know you're going from something that's under $100 to something that's over $5,000 which like just depending on the framing. But ours works pretty well. I was just aware of and whatever. I'll go into that another video. But and then hamster wheel versus retention. Um this was a big difference between the guys even sitting next to us that are running the same business model essentially as us with like paid very heavy evergreen consistent around there like around those kind of things. Um but they have insane retention like insane retention and it's a much higher ticket. So much higher like five times the price of ours. Um so I thought that was very interesting cuz they can do less volume. the retention is crazy because like they went through a lull like we did uh with new acquisition and when we go through a lull in new acquisition it's like sorry these guys are having too much fun. Um but when we go through a lull in acquisition it's it hurts everything because while we do have retention it's nowhere near like the rate or the dollar value that theirs is. So I thought that was very interesting um and definitely something we need to optimize around. So I just really next one on here is like the love info coaching space. Like I'm such a fan of it. I think it's so cool. I mean, it's not like I don't want to say it's like not it just has so many unique cool characteristics and Iman talked about this a bit, but like I don't know. I just like really respect the way that he's built into the space. Um, and you know, people [ __ ] on him or not. I don't really care. Like I I think it's I think what he does is just crazy. I think he crushes it. Um, but they really are more so cash flow businesses. So, we talk about like, you know, hitting exit velocity and getting to a point where we have actual equity value and we can actually sell something uh or sell this with supplements included or, you know, backend recurring and main recurring and multiple acquisitions or and like all these different things you'd have to do to essentially like it would still cash flow like heavy during that process, but like you're building it in a way that you're almost like eating away at the cash flow and eating away at the time and resources in order to get to this like potential thing. Uh, which is just a different way than these guys play. Like these guys are like dead set, very clear, like this is a cash flow business. We're going to run these things at 80% margin and we are just going to hammer it while we can. Take all the money out of there. They all live in places that are like very, you know, low tax or no tax zones. We're going to take all that money and we're going to buy into this company or this software. We're going to build this other side thing or we're going to have ecom business that has uh equity value. Um yeah, so it's just like a it's just like a different game. It's just a different game. What you going to bring us in? I'm going to bring you in in 12 seconds. And then uh people people uh best part about the entire thing was the people in the room. So by far this was a very very low um low amount of content necessarily. So there's like a much much lower I don't you go to some conferences that are literally just endless amounts of content just presentation presentation presentation and we like hate those. So while you can get gold golden nuggets out of those it's just like really boring kind of. Um so this was very much so like Q&A focused. So, it was like x amount of presentation, then a lot of Q&A or like uh fireside chats with a mic in the audience. Um, and then just hang out with people like the entire time. So, it was lunches and breakfast, I'm sorry, breakfast, lunch, um, dinners where everyone was kind of moved around. So they had to like kind of meet and it was small enough that you could like meet everyone but not big enough that you'd like that you wait small enough that you wouldn't run into like the same person or like you know be forced to only be with like 12 people but it was not large too large to where you didn't get to meet anybody you didn't want to meet. So I found that really cool and there were some very high level people there like very very high level people that were just like super approachable and just like want to talk to everyone. It was cool. So I thought that was very cool. Um, I did create some questions for these guys and uh, you guys have kind of asked for this a little bit in the past. So, we're going to see what we got here. But, uh, Mary does a bunch of media buying for info coaching and I believe Mary, you do ecom, too, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, he does info and ecom, but, uh, he does some whales and info and then Luke co-founder talk about business partner in the biz. So, I'm going to take you out there and we're going to see how this looks and if it sucks, I'm going to [ __ ] turn it off. So, that's that, boys. The time is now. See how this looks. See how this looks. Can we turn around? Yeah, you should turn around on your beautiful balcony. All right. Can we see? Can we see? Look at that. We can see. All right. I'm going to hit you with questions. I'm going to sit over here. That was beautiful. Perfect. Yeah. Um All right. 10 minutes in. We're going to go for a little bit from the get. What did you spend till I always talk about this on here? When were you were still spending? We didn't even have media buyers until what? 20 a day. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. 15. Yeah. So Luke was the one who was literally doing all the media buying, all the copy, most of the copy, creative review, all of that stuff up until we at like 20. We tried agencies. If you go back, I talk about this more, but we talked we we ran with agencies and then in the end we ended up landing with Marus. I always say his name wrong, but he's a goat and he works with a bunch of different info people, which is interesting because we don't have a lot of contractors that are like agency. And you wouldn't consider yourself an agency though, would you? I don't I hate saying I'm an agency, but we're kind of Yeah. slowly becoming one. So, where we're going with things and like the growth of it, like we need a lot of dedicated people and like we have exceptions and we made an exception for this guy over here forward. Um, yeah. So in if you guys go back to other videos, I have org charts where we talk about the structure and like who else exists within the marketing team. Um but these guys full run all of meta. So we're just going to go through some random meta questions. So current no what's a better one. How do we run optimizations because everyone asks this all the time and how do you handle campaign structure? Well, okay. Um, our rock specifically is dividing. If I have to do two big categories, it would be scheduled campaigns that optimize us to get qualified book calls in and purchase campaigns, which in our case, our sales cycle is pretty long. So, purchase campaigns takes a very long time until it fires on the pixel, but at the same time, it brings us the best quality and also acts as a pretty much your marketing campaign on steroids. So two main two categories it's purchase and schedule campaigns from there we have a [ __ ] ton of other campaigns like if you look if someone looks at our account it will probably say it's unorganized but that's because we also have a lot of other funnels now when you're running do you run I mean I know you run other info funnels but so if you run other call funnels is that how you normally have them set up or are they set up differently for us meaning is the schedule and purchase thing normal to like throttle between the two. That is normal. We we run them both across VSLs and webinars too. Interesting. Okay. Webinars are actually even more efficient way of purchase campaigns. And is that because it's direct to cart so it feeds back quicker? Yeah. So like you know let's say you run 5 days prior to the webinar like you know every single Wednesday or every single Thursday I'll get 100 fires on the pixel from that webinar. Interesting. Okay. Um, how do you handle creative testing and different when they're I guess how do you handle creative testing when you have similar angles? So like small changes and then when you have massive like completely different changes in terms of angles and messaging depends on on budget too. Um, if you're working with an account that can't handle budget like yours, usually we we do give creative testing the structure is let's say one we have the creative testing campaign, one asset, the asset dedicated specific to that specific creative. No matter if we have a couple of other creatives that are very similar, maybe the hook is different. We'll give let's say x amount of budget. Let's say 300 bucks. And in there will not have only one but usually it's either two or three creatives and like the same creative but just have different copy iterations because usually you'll see that this specific creative with copy two will work better than the other two variations like you choose a winner that one. Sorry about all the audio. This is probably terrible but I kind of don't care. All right, Kish, you wrote the copy for the ads that did like 80% of the revenue of the entire thing and they lived through and it almost burned us in the best way possible because weinging hammered it and we needed more diversification and we didn't. How what is your copy journey? My copy journey? Yeah. Uh I was up in it when I read it. Uh, so you know that was a long time ago, but I was just writing a bunch of [ __ ] copy when I wrote those ads. So I just was deep into books and writing sales pages and trying lots of different copy. So yeah, that's everyone asked me how we like learn [ __ ] and I always talk about how I find people who have what we want. We model it and we buy courses and we [ __ ] speedrun and do that. But at that time, do you remember the courses we were in? Remember that like the courses, the lives? I was an absolute psychopath during that time. Yeah. So I I didn't let myself do anything other than like there was a period of time where I literally didn't let myself consume anything other than books and videos on marketing and how to [ __ ] like literally at the end of the night I'd be like I just want to like watch TV and I would just make myself watch like [ __ ] funnel videos and marketing videos. So, and how did that change? Because we went from, most people on here know, but we went from low ticket, the app game, and we were dumb, didn't understand ascension and all that at the time, and then we went to kind of infodirect, but then mainly it was just the salesunnel, the sales call funnel. So, like what shifted in how cuz you ran all the accounts up until we were doing like over a million a month. Mhm. So, like what did you frame change or have to learn to like how did the account change when doing that? It was just literally [ __ ] spending more. Yeah. You're just hammering it more. Yeah. Yeah. We used to budget. We used to go in and we have like all these automated trackers now and for two and a half or 3 years of it, we would manually fill it out every single day. So, we know exactly what was in there and look at the metrics every day manually because we didn't trust that ourselves too if it just ran automatically. Um, all right. What do you feel like in current state in current state is wasting time or where we're like overlapping like where is there like fluff and what we're currently doing in marketing? That's both of you. I don't think we're wasting too much time. I don't know if it's time. I don't know if it's our creative or you know I say like you know the Blake Blake who's the CMO is like putting together a new team and I think there's like time before that all goes as fast as it can and I think there's like organization stuff that wastes time where things don't go probably like as fast as they could but I think with some time that will change because it's just a new team. I I have a take on this, please. Like on on wasting time. Not not sure if it's wasting time, but a thought that I every single time I look at that low ticket ad account that we run, my thought is like, why the [ __ ] is this one not running international? Cuz we could be making so much more money. Well, usually it's cuz the people that would then ascend would be international and then we wouldn't be able to service them with the coaching because of the time zones and the net CPA isn't good right now. But like he's saying it'd be lower cost, right? But like it's much much so we'd be able to get purchases but we wouldn't the issue is they wouldn't ascend at 5%. Even if they did we wouldn't be able to service them right as well. So if you would have something as we were talking with Luke in the sauna today you would have fulfillment team that's not necessarily only US based you could have a whole division like the low ticket finals most of the low ticket finals we run on international so outside of US the moment you get even in Canada UK Australia Europe the lier becomes profitable on the front end yeah I was talking to the XYZ guy I can tell you after but I was talking to them they did like three million a month but they're out of one of those main countries and they're calls are like so much different than ours. When he was saying stuff, I was like, "That's that's very interesting." Um, getting outside of the US. Yeah. Okay. So, what time is Oh man, we got to leave for dinner like any minute now. Um, if how do I say this correctly? Uh, of the other ones you see. So, I just talked about this on here about organic versus paid and how much different it is and how these guys are running it. Like we had a guy that was at the thing that uh at the event that is has 90% 92% show rates and 55% close rates because it's all organic and he was like, "Oh, I want to run ads." I'm like, "Dude, your shit's going to get cut in half and you're going to need double the team and it's going to be whatever." So, how do you see in the other companies and how do you see it in ours organic as a piece of this function? Do you work with a bunch of people that have a ton of organic and then some paid or is it usually like a mix? And then what do you think about our organic current setup or where we're going to go with it? I hope you guys can hear me because I'm talking that way. So sorry. Most of the clients we work with do have organic. I I would say in terms of companies that do seven figure plus a month constantly. Both of them probably have I would say 20% of their monthly revenue that comes from organic and which I don't think in our case is the case. No, it's not even close. Yeah, I always say I'm like our first click is like 2% organic. Um, like in their cases also think of they do come probably because we're spending so much on all of those funnels, they do come from ads, they start following and it like it becomes like a very long sales cycle where like they consume so much content and then they opt in in the funnel and it's like organic. Yeah. Like there's no way to prove it came from an ad. But super important especially the YouTube side of things. Yeah. I will not say the name of the company, but you know the guy very well and it's not like he runs a YouTube channel and it's not even his main like it's not even the company YouTube channel like he just has the link in bio and he's producing a couple six figures a month just from those YouTube videos. Yeah. And on their paid they're profitable on their front end and their calls they literally do a negative number on what their call costs them because they're actually making money to book calls. Um, all right. And then, yeah, so I always talk about on here, organic for us exists as middle and bottom of funnel. It's also one of the reasons the VSSL opt-in funnel works for us is because once we have their email, we hit them with so much content that then they go back to the site and it exists as a flywheel, which is actually Luke's initial idea um to make like a website that was filled with the resources that had a flywheel or whatever you call a web of content where they just exist within it and can continue. Um, so where do you see I've kind of talked about it. Where do you see us going with organic for first click? Like true organic generation versus middle and bottom. Um, like do you think it's going to be important for us in the future? Do you not care about it? We're just going to hammer it with paid. Yeah, I don't care. I don't care. Um, I I look at it more like it's just views and if you have something with good organic, there's a lot of advantages to it and then it can be really profitable. And then, you know, eventually, usually if you want to scale bigger for whatever reason, you leave that audience and then you have to go into cold traffic. Um, and then you're doing paid. So, I think I think it I don't think of them as like different things. It's just what's your business model and then what are your goals? And if you know you want to be super profitable and not spend money on ads and you have good organic, then just keep doing that. And then if you want to do ads, do ads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like I don't know. I know so many of these guys now in this organic world and I look at their P&Ls and their stuff like a lot of the time they're not doing as big of numbers or if they do sorry fast cars. Um but a lot of the time these guys don't do as large of numbers but they do insane percent right like 80 90% margins cuz they don't take 30%. I will say the good part about like if you're trying to scale a team I like paid. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz it's consistent. Yeah. Because like once you get it working, it's kind of like a machine. Like you can put if you know you can put one in and get three out. Yeah. And you can hire people more comfortably I feel like than like having to like rely on a video and and that's just my experience though. You can be so good at organic that you feel like you have more control with organic. So yeah, it's like a double-edged sword cuz like you have like I talked about on here like evergreen and consistency is one thing and then the other side of it though is the cost of it and then if it breaks and you have a straight line, you're [ __ ] potentially because like you're just relying on this one thing, cash going out the door, build up a big team and then it stops and you don't have this organic base you can like try and push through or do something with and then it's retention. It's this and that. So we actually got to pop out of here. Um, and then the last thing on organic is I have talked about on here. We just hired a company to do organic and all these things and it's hilarious. We got to have a conversation one time on here about like how we make decisions and like our overlap and what because it's pretty [ __ ] funny. So, all right guys, you rock. Thank you. We'll make this better and longer and probably over something, you know, on an actual like Riverside or something. But peace, guys. Day 93 in the books.
