# The $15M Underground Pay Per Call Business... (w/ Nate Ancelet) | EP78
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJT5-jcZio

What's up, guys? On today's video, we have Nate Ansellet. Is that how you say it? Yes, sir. Amazing. So, he is a bit different than some of the other videos on here. We've had a lot of info coaching, guys, and he lives more in the paper call and lead genen game. So, Nate, kick it off. Who are you? The quick intro. Yeah, absolutely. Um, my name is Nate Anslet. I run a company called Money Print of Marketing. We are a leading affiliate uh paper call network. Um, we buy and sell traffic in dozens of different verticals. Um, but mostly focused on like insuranceances. Um, and recently I, you know, deployed this course. So now I'm like going hard on personal content. So that's been, you know, it's been something that's been like a new development. But our, our core business model is just being a a affiliate network for performance marketers. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, I've definitely heard your name around many a time. We have plenty of uh mutuals. But it's funny you say that. I always joke. I'm like, I buy everyone's everything. I'm in that course. I'm in like anything like that. I always buy and just consume on a weekend. So I watch that whole thing. a toz. But so what's the difference between a network and broker and like what are the differences in those in your world? So um it's the same thing essentially. Uh it's just different terms. Um however a network is like uh a company that would like in my experience if somebody came up to me and was like yo I'm a paper call broker or I'm a paper call network. When I think of a network, I think of more types and verticals and industries of offers compared to a paper call broker, which could absolutely be in as many verticals as they want to or industries. However, typically brokers focus on one to three verticals. So, they may be like, I'm a Medicare call insurance broker, right? Okay. And then also on top of that, it also comes down to what systems have you built and put into place in order to create your network, right? So the network for us is like not only do we buy and sell traffic, but we manage traffic. We manage the quality of the traffic. We have people that um are listening to all of the calls to make sure that everything's, you know, happening the way it needs to. The whole process is built. So that's like a really like a network. Whereas a lot of times brokers, it could be I could just be a broker where I happen to know the largest Medicare sales agency in the world. And so I'm like hanging out with my homie because he runs it as the CMO and then I've got like oh he he hits me up. He's like, "Oh, bro, like I need Medicare calls. Can you find them for me?" And then I just go and talk to the Nate Anellets and the other guys that have the calls and I sell them and it's just I'm just a broker, right? I'm just making arbitrage game. Yeah, bro. It just you just charge a little rip on top and you you know you make a lot of money, guys. Yeah. So, I've seen some uh I think it's Andrew, the Yotter guy. He uh he made a video. So, what kind of numbers are you throwing around or do you publicly share of like where you're at just so everyone knows who they're listening to? Yeah. To be honest, like it's so funny because on my channel and on my page and stuff, we talked about 15 million that we've done. And like, bro, it's almost embarrassing because because and you probably can relate to this, bro. I can relate so hard, bro. Because like 15 million to me, it's like it's like it's like damn. Like, it's only like 15 M is laughable, bro. There's guys that do 15 M's monthly. There's guy like there's there's [ __ ] Manny Zukarelli. Uh like I've I've actually never met him in person. I know his partner Rich really well. Manny is a super well-known guy in the space, bro. They have like one or two hundred million [ __ ] Ringa awards hanging up in their house. And I'm like I'm sitting over here at 15 million. People are like, "Oh, you're a scammer. You're a capper." I'm like, "Dude, 15." Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to lie about 15. Trust me. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like Like exactly. Like if I'm going to lie, I'm going to be like, "Yeah, we've done $85 million in the past three years." Like, "No, bro. No, we haven't." Yeah. Yeah. No, but it's cool to see because there's so many people that are a lot of So, the main person who watches this and like who at least the target of it is are the mid6 figure a month guys and some seven figure guys roughly speaking. Uh mainly it's going to be info coaching because that's the world I come from. But like it's lead genen affiliate, it's SAS, it's agency, it's ecom, it's like it is a vast kind of thing and that's from X and then some of the stuff from YouTube because I'll talk more like business principle but I do talk a lot info coaching funnels. So your VSSLs, your opt-ins, your ticket stuff. So yeah. No, I mean 15 I mean that's still that's size, right? Like I talk about we always say on our we're almost at 75 which is the third disc on here and it's like that's ever right. It's like 30 million was last year, which is cool cuz we're like this, but like it's still it's not it's not that crazy. Like I know guys like you said who do 15 a month in our exact space and you're just like damn. And then they look at you and they're like oh that's cute. Like Yeah, that's cute. Oh yeah. Yeah. Ryan's making videos every day about it. Yeah. You're like damn it, bro. But the thing is though, like you know once you get over a few I would say over a few like I don't even want to say like a million you can accidentally do. You can accidentally run something run up a million dollars and then you're like, "Oh [ __ ] that was [ __ ] cool." You know what I mean? But then it can die super fast. Like as you know with info products or like neutra products or black hat offers like there's plenty of things you can run up that crush it and then die. And like that's why for me in my network like we try to build something or we're always focusing on building something that's sustainable and something that we can maintain and then ultimately one day hopefully sell. Yeah. So you're one of the, you know, I don't want to call it info coaching, but like that piece of the business that you're doing, you're doing it similar to someone who I don't really want to call people out, but like there's lead genen guy who does the same thing who is like, yes, there's a little bit of price, you know, pay to play just so people value it, but your real game on the back end of your community on school or wherever you're on is a bigger like a bigger game, right? So like what's the what's the play there? What's the backend version of that? Yeah. Yeah. No. So basically there there's a few different things. So, number one is something that I've noticed and I think we all know that are actually willing to pull our dick out and put it on the table. Sorry if we're not allowed to talk. You're good. Run it. Run it. We're raw. Yeah. But the real raw. That's crazy. Um, but no, so the point is is like if you're willing to show that you know something and you're willing to build a personal brand, the only way for people to trust you on a completely different level is if you provide raw content that shows who you are and that you have value to provide to the market. And if you're working in a very dominated industry where you have a lot of competition, you have to be able to stick out and show people like, not only do I know what I'm talking about, but I actually know it better than most people that I compete with. Yeah. So, the first and most foremost play was the school community was created so that people so that I was able to publish and create content and literally pay for itself. to be fair, like I have now over 300 people in less than three months. I have 300 people in the group that are paying and that's awesome. But like if you knew the money we made respectfully and out of all humility, thank God for our blessings. Like dude, like 300 people paying me 30 bucks a month is like not like come on, what is that? That's like a [ __ ] food bill. You know what I mean? Like that's like whatever. So the point is is now the good news is the money that that does bring in, it allows me to pay for the content that we produce. But I kind of stopped making content because I realized that just like posting real [ __ ] on Twitter and Instagram and YouTube that I'm just like daily life, not even daily life, but just like the industry like that performs way better than the like me sitting in a [ __ ] suit in a studio sweating my balls off because it's hot as [ __ ] here in Colombia. And I just the only time I actually have time to like focus and remove myself from everybody is to be in Colia. Like, you know, everyone's like, "Oh, you know, I go to Columbia because of this reason or that reason." Bro, the reason why I'm in Columbia is cuz I can remove myself from everyone. All the distractions are gone. There's no [ __ ] birthday parties. Like, "Hey, bro, come to the club on Friday cuz we have a birthday." And then I feel like I have to go or else I'm a douchebag friend. I don't have any of that, right? I literally am completely removed. So, anyway, to get back to it is this uh and I'm a mad ADHD guy, bro. No, no, run it. Run it, dude. I'm telling you, these are raw. These are fun. Some people watch a clip of it and are like, "Cool." And then most people just watch through the end and just like play them in the background. They just want to hear comos. So, but now to talk about So, not only is that paying for itself, yes, great. But also, I'm providing a [ __ ] insane amount of value, right? Like the the course itself, bro, I for three months straight here in Colombia. I came to Columbia and I told myself, I'm like, I'm going to focus on I have two goals. One, create a [ __ ] ton of content for a personal brand. Two, create a course and a community. And so when I created this course and community, my entire thought process was actually a lot more altruistic than people probably would think. Like yes, can I make money on that? Yes. Can I make money with consulting calls? Yes. Can I make money with um the affiliates that come from that? Yes. But bro, check this out. Check out this [ __ ] play. Okay. What if I taught people about something that you can make a [ __ ] ton of money on, but no one knows about yet in our age, in our industry? If I could teach you how to do that and then once I provided you with the tools on how to do it, I literally for you curate a fat [ __ ] community of everyone that knows the exact same [ __ ] and how to do it that all wants to do the same thing and make money together now instead of you because the the biggest question I always get is how do I get started in paper call, bro? Like how do I even start? [ __ ] There's 300 people in there that you can message and be like, "Can we get on a call cuz like I'm trying to figure out what you're doing. I want to do something. I know you're selling calls in life insurance. I'm selling calls in life insurance. Like, let's put our heads together and see if there's money to be made." Yeah. So, if you're able to create this fat and they're all brokers, bro, there's brokers and there's actual media buyers and like lead originators. So, if we create this huge group of people buying traffic and people selling traffic, they all can work together to make money together. And if I would have had this [ __ ] resource when I got started six years ago, dog, oh my god, [ __ ] would be different. Because the thing about paper call in this game is it's not about who's got the best calls. It's not about who's got the most elite form of AI that you can put to qualify your No, it's literally about relationships. Like, can you go to a conference, find an old dude that you start getting drunk with at 3:00 in the morning, and he starts venting you to you about how his wife is a piece of [ __ ] and he she took the kids, and you're just sitting there like, "Oh, damn. That's horrible, bro." And then he's like, "Oh, yeah, by the way, I'm actually the CMO of All State." And you're like, "Oh." And he's like, "You're really cool. We should do business." And you're like, "Yeah." And then you get it and then all of a sudden you have this [ __ ] relationship. Bro, this whole game is about relationships, bro. It's all about relationships. You can always find better traffic, bro. You can always find better traffic. Like, there's a million [ __ ] media buyers out there. You give them a landing page. You say, "Drive traffic with this angle of this creative," and they're going to [ __ ] do it. And they can do it insane numbers. But like, not everyone can get and manage those relationships. So, if you can focus on that part, bro, the game's over. And then finally, the last part of the long game is just affiliate acquisition. Like, yes, I'm getting some of the biggest [ __ ] affiliates that are in my space currently in that group. And then also cold get like getting cold audiences that are massive massive media buyers guys that are doing $ 1.5 $3 million a month in ad spend right and it's not just one or two in every vertical you could think of insurance motor vehicle accident [ __ ] tors everything you could think of they are all coming to this group to learn paper call so it's like bro we have some of the biggest like the conversations I've been having with people has been insane and that so that's ultimately what I'm doing is it's just like I'm trying to put as many That's my only skill. I suck at everything. I suck at media buying. I [ __ ] suck at basketball. Okay. I can't think like my brain sucks. But I am really good at bringing people. You're sociable. There's no doubt. Yeah. You know what I mean? All like your your 2020 your 2025 come up is real. Like these conversations, these big ones. That's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah. So my quick on this uh so I was in Puerto Rico for the last three. So I have, you know, a couple of those friends down there. Like I'm close friends with uh my other guys that, you know, say not to be named, but yeah, he's just Yeah. Oh god. Yeah. And uh No, but so I have some experience in the game when we were building up this info coaching thing. It was more so like I was just kind of in a lot of the tech pieces, but it was it was low workload. We were just going to cash flow bids. We weren't going to scale it like too aggressively, which now we are. But I was doing a ton of like marketing tech style stuff behind some big guys that were spending, you know, 200 a day and they were doing a lot of ACA. They were doing like some random affiliate launch stuff, which is a little different, but like big in the paper call game to my understanding and like where I was. So I was in there building Ringbuff flows. I'm doing like every every post, every this and into whatever lead prosper and back and then into sheets and like look up like I was doing all that kind of stuff and it opened my eyes to it. The first call I end up having on here when I start doing stuff on X is with Adam Young and he's like oh let's just jam. So we just pop on never met him and we just like he just blew my mind. So I've had his book. I've watched his whole paper class and like to this day I'm like the next or like the side quest that I'm going to make is some paper call like just juggernaut thing on the side that's scalable that's lean that I can just sell that is just like a zero to one thing because I've never done it. So like when you guys I saw you guys tweeting about or talking about the insurance focus. So is that where you're leaning now is insurance mainly? Oh yeah completely for the game dude. Yeah like 100%. Yeah, cuz like the thing is this, bro, with home services, home services is fire, but home services is primarily dominated in terms of traffic generation from Google. Yeah. From Google traffic, right? People like Google search native YouTube. But as we all know, like if you have a Facebook account, right, that's like cracked with one specific pixel, right? because it's just knows debt settlement or it knows ACA like it's you got it. It's the same thing with Google, right? If you have Google, you have a good ad account or you have good people that like get you priority in terms of placements, all the different things that you can do on Google, you can dominate that. The problem is that there's only so much [ __ ] search volume, right? So, there's only so many people that are searching for solar near me or roofing near me or window replacement near me. And most of the home services verticals, most do not perform near as [ __ ] well with social traffic as they do with search, which is probably [ __ ] pretty consistent with everything ever, right? Any offer is always going to perform better with search because the intent is there. Yeah. However, social is crazy for insuranceances and social is where you can scale, right? Like, yes, you can do, you know, several hundred, maybe several thousand calls a day with insuranceances on, you know, Medicare, um, on Google search. No question. I mean, you can do a [ __ ] ton of volume, but specifically with home services, I mean, if you're doing a couple hundred billable a day, you got a super healthy campaign. And like me as a broker, I make5 to $10 a call. I'm not I I have a saying, you know, don't be a pig, pigs get slaughtered. So, I only take $5 to $10 per call. So, if I have two opportunities, if I can focus on solar or I'm going to do 150 billables a day times $10 per call or even $20 per call, that margin comparatively to 5,000 calls a day for five bucks in billable margin a call, bro, my [ __ ] scale is like it's it's like non-comparable, right? So, that's why for me as a broker, I focus on insuranceances. Also, CPAs are significantly easier to manage with insuranceances. So, your your buyer retention is like way better than like solar cuz like solar, bro, you know, it fluctuates 25 $3,500 per sale. You know what I'm saying? The traffic's expensive. There's not a whole lot of it. It's just [ __ ] hard. So, yes, like long story long, yeah, insurance is is is 100% our play. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, I want to talk offline about this for sure because I have a I have a fun domain about this. So I ran an info style like VSSL funnel for um whole life insurance. So they were doing an infinite banking game. So it was like with direct I had direct relationships with actual like advisers and we were just landing leads and the qual I mean they were qualified. The cost per was gas but the consump what why' you stop? Because the consumption ring of it was too short and they weren't necessarily the best. I mean, you're talking to a 60some year old about taking $5 million out of their 401k and pushing it basically into a whole policy and like crazy commissions and you know, LDV to CAC was there, but like the time trough and the consumption, the drop off was just crazy. So, there's guys who have crushed it with this and like you look at some of the bigger guys that have these huge education modes, but aren't that's the big thing is the consumption education mode, the trust that needs to be there in order to do the size of those type of transactions. So, it just was like I wasn't in the full zone of it. I was really just running marketing and marketing tech and not like any of the back like I would now. But there's just a total play. I have the most baller B2B domain for this uh for that specific that I still hold. So I have a buddy I'm like talking about just launching it like siloed just like media buyer a creative and like a bisdev guy and just having like a three-man team and just go to war. 100%. Yeah. So who do you see I mean you know the game you've been in the game lead genen affiliate paper call. So like within lead genen, you've got forums, you've got p like what is what's like the dream stack? Because you're going to have a lot of people who are going to be media buyers or something that's going to listen to this. So like is it start as a media buyer? Is it just RAM like just RAM 24/7 forms? Is it start with paper call? Like what's the what's hot now? I don't even know. So, it's actually I I just had this conversation cuz I do I do consulting calls now, which was a very recent development, but I started doing a I did this consulting call with this guy who's like, "Yo, I have a lot of experience with media buying. Like, should I start in paper call?" And I the thing is this, it depends on what you want to build, right? So some people like payper call is very different and it is an entirely different beast than pay per lead. And the reason why is because of all of the variables outside of what you can simply manage that impacts the performance of the campaign. So when we think paper call, we got to think let's just say Facebook ad for life insurance, you know, final expense. Facebook ad, you're going to drive to a landing page. When you drive to the landing page, it's going to qualify. Then it's going to populate the the click to call button. Then they click to click the call button and then it gets routed in. Now the current setups with buyers is it's called RTB, real-time bidding. So essentially, you're shooting this this call is coming into your tracking system. Shout out Retriever. It comes into your Really? I didn't know that. Oh dude, I'm I retriever dog all day. Every day. Yeah. All day. every day, dude. I've set up in there and I've set up in Ringbuta and obviously I have no cat in the I got nothing in the fight, but like interesting. Okay, continue, sir. Yeah, I mean, Ringbot has its perks, but and I'm not going to dog on Ringbuta. All I'm going to say, I respect Ringbuta, Adam. He's a good guy. You know, we're in like a lot of the same like highlevel affiliate chats. You know what I'm saying? I have nothing but respect for the guy. Um, you know, we've had several conversations in interviews. Um, but yeah, dude, Retriever all day, all day, every day. And I I can I can give you the story on why if if you want. Um and there there's like it's not tea, but there's there's a very good reason why I they both do the job, right? It's like me saying I'm on WordPress versus Web Flow. Like it does the job. Yes. It very much does the job. It just has to do with what do you want to use? And my team and my operations manager and the president of my company, she's like, "Dude, like we're only ever going to use Retriever." I'm like, "Yeah, that's what Mory set everything up on back in the day, too." Yeah. you know. So anyway, um, so you shoot the, so really quick, go back, add landing page, you shoot the call into your RTB. Now, the RTB is very hard because essentially what an RTB is, real-time bidding, it allows buyers in their system to determine based on where that lead is coming from, social or search or whatever, and then what state it's in, and whatever filters that that landing page is filtering for. A lot of times they request that you pass the data with the call. And so, and again, this is like the intricacies that come with paper call. So now you shoot the call in. It's bidded on real time and there's also an agent availability ping that is typically plugged into the RGB to determine if there's an agent availability. So if the call comes in, they're not just [ __ ] ringing and ringing and ringing. They're able to determine real time, is there an agent available to take this call? Now let's say there's an agent available to take this call, god [ __ ] willing. So now the call comes in, the agents available, they take the call, and then now we have an agent. So now we can talk about the agent's performance. Uh, hi. Uh, hi. This is John. And then the caller's like, "Hi." And they're like, "Uh, how can I help you?" And they're like, "I just saw this ad for health insurance." Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're looking for health. And you're like, "Dude, like you know where this call is coming from. It's from an assigned DID, which is a phone number that you gave me. You know what's going Why are you picking up the phone saying, "Hello, I think this is John." Like, what? Like, you need to have a sales process. Hello, thank you for calling the enrollment center. Are you looking for a new life insurance policy today? Yes, I am. Okay, outstanding. Very excited to have this conversation. Are you currently over the age of and then immediately qualifying, right? And then so we're qualifying and then there's the buffer. So for those that don't know the the buffer, I'll just very briefly explain it. A buffer or a duration is simply a period of time that you as an affiliate are allotting to the buyer for them to have a conversation with the potential prospect. The call or that is calling in. it is a a specific amount of time that you guys agree upon to qualify them and if they are not qualified they hang up the phone and the call is not a billable lead. However, if they have that call and it goes past that uh that predetermined time 90 seconds, 10 seconds, 120 seconds, whatever that conversation is, um if it goes past that, now it is considered a billable call. So now that it's gone past the billable, now they have to close that person and they have to manage those CPAs and all of those things which is difficult. However, there's some pros to that because with leads or Okay, so that's the that's basically the entirety of paper call. Yeah, that's the that's the call portion versus the lead portion, right? Whereas a lead portion is you know uh add creative to the landing page that's typically hosted by the buying party. Yeah. Difference there, right? instead of you self-hosting your landers and your click to call, you're instead you're just sending it to their hosting their their page, which we have, right? Like we have offers like that. So then they they shoot the traffic in and as soon as that leads populated, it posts back real time and boom, you're paid. Like that's all it like or at least you're you're showing to be paid, right? Like it's like there no there's no more gray area in terms of is this lead going to be billable or not. So, like if I were a brand new media buyer or somebody that comes from ecom, it may make more sense to start with a lead form offer only. But, and this is a huge butt, it really comes down to your buyer, right? Because you want to have a conversation with your buyer. If if you're my buyer and I want to generate, let's just stick with health insurance, like ACA. Say you're an ACA buyer and I come to you and I'm like, "Listen, this is what I'm capable of generating. I want to generate you calls, but I need to make sure that there is no RTB [ __ ] You're going to pay me $40 for every call that I generate that lasts over 90 seconds, and I'm going to be shooting as many calls in, and you're going to have plenty of agents available to me." If that buyer's like, "Done, let's do it. Let's move on. Like, just send me good traffic." that may make more sense for you if you have a good buyer with proven sales processes and proven sales strategies with a a large enough team to withstand any level of volume that you can send him no matter if it's three calls a day or 3,000 calls a day or whatever you're willing to agree upon, right? And but so like that's one buyer that's like a great instance or maybe you go to a buyer and you're like, "Hey, listen. I want to generate leads for you and this is the landing page that I've created for you and this is the traffic and how I'm going to generate those leads with the social ad placements. So there's Google search ad placements. I'm going to drive the traffic to this lander. They're going to fill out this form. I need an integration to your CRM. And every time we generate a lead, I just want you to pay me 30 bucks or 20 bucks. And my job as an affiliate is to make sure that when you're buying those leads at $30 a pop that we're hitting the target cost per acquisition goals on the back end for you. and I'm also making sure that my cost per lead is lower than $30. So again, it really comes down to the conversation that you have with the buyer and the agreement that you're able to come to with them. So again, and that that ultimately just comes down to to what the setup is. So it's not really like, oh, if you're new, you should do paper call. Oh, you should do affiliate or like you should do leads. Um, if you're brand [ __ ] new, I would absolutely go to like shout out Scale Club. like they're a good company and they host a lot of uh form offers. And so basically like you as a media buyer, you just hit them up and you're like, "Hey, I want to like run your debt offer." And they give you a landing page and then you just get your creatives approved with them and then you drive the traffic to their landing page and then it posts back in Everflow, which is the tracking system and it's all [ __ ] kosher, you know? Like that's probably the easiest way to start. Yeah, dude. This game is so interesting to me and I'm for sure, at least on the back end of this going to pick your brain. We're going to build one live. But so you've got inside your lead genen, you've got your pay per call and then from there it's generally like you're calling it the buffer so call it 90 second whatever you know 120 you have your things you have pay per lead within there you have revshare models in there and then you have forms that are gener like kind of the same it's like per lead or revshare yeah so as a network you typically work on a revshare model so like you can call it whatever you want a cost per call model ultimately it's a revshare right you're as a buyer if you're reselling that traffic to an end client, you are essentially aggregating traffic. So because of that, you will have a margin on your side. So because of that, if the buyer is paying you 40 bucks and you're paying out 30 bucks, you have a 25% margin, right? The $10 of the 40. So you're still technically working on a rev share. But then there's also another way where it's a cost per sale model and they can call it a rev share like that. So, it's like instead of you getting paid on a billable call, a duration, you get paid when something turns into a sale, aka CPA. We still as a company make more like I post [ __ ] on Retriever uh or like uh you know, Retriever screenshots on X, bro. Like that that's those aren't even our numbers. Those are like some of our numbers. Most of my money comes from direct relationships that I have connected outside of our organization. I do not pay for tracking. I do not pay for anything. All I do is I'm just like, "Hey, Mr. buyer. I don't want to broker this traffic because I respect you and love you and I also respect and love this media buyer a lot. I would rather just connect you guys. You pay me $5 a call, give me access to your Retriever account, and then I'll just watch it and then I'll have my accounting team bill you every week. That is how we make our the most amount of [ __ ] money. Now, we also have our network where we make great money. Thank you, God. We're blessed. We make great money with our network where we do have media buyers that just run our [ __ ] But for the select few that we know do crazy numbers that we can trust with everything and I'm willing to introduce to my client directly as a buyer, bro, it makes way more sense to just let them work together, especially in like um very government uh managed verticals like Medicare, right? Like when there's when anything funky could go on, bro, just let them connect. Make sure you have a good relationship with both of them. And like my relationships are so good where like they won't burn me. And if they did burn me, I would just pull up to their house and be like, "Fuck you and your wife, bro. I know you. We like hung out, bro. Like, we're going to talk [ __ ] about you now. We hung out before, bro. We hung out before, dog. So, okay. So, so the stack and there's pros and cons, I'm sure, to all of this because you can have broker, you can have you we're going to call media buyer over here. You can have media buyer, you can have broker, and you're going to have client. That client side can go even further. Yeah. Because you can have, like you said, a CMO of All State, or you can go direct to an agent, or you can go, you know, home service example. There's the regional guys that buy at in volume and then do the distribution. And like obviously pros and cons because if not you're routing to all these you've got no standardization of scripts. You've got a you know hours all that stuff. So the main play then is is just that right there. So you're trying to go like as big as you can almost on buyers and consistent high volume guys on media buying is like the dream. That's honestly such an awesome question because it again it comes down to what do you want to build, right? So there's like the [ __ ] e-local, right? They arguably buy the most traffic out of anybody. Um but and specifically in home services, but they charge a 50% margin. Mhm. Right. So they're buying calls and they're paying you 90 bucks. You know they're getting paid 180. Right. So like you're looking and you're going, "Damn, a 50% margin and all you're doing is managing the buyers." Like that's very thick. Like in our network, we typically pay out no less than 75%. like on our really healthy campaigns that we've been running for years and we know the buyer and we've worked years to nurture that relationship. I've gone through horrible things with them and now I've got my payout really nice. Like I'll be paying out, you know, 75%. On a new buyer where we're trying to build a relationship, I'll be paying out 90%. Whereas guys like E-LO, you know, they have all their processes and yes, they manage hundreds or maybe thousands of different buyers in different, you know, dozens of different verticals, but they charge 50%. But the scalability because of the nationwide coverage is a lot of times more attractive because if you can run, you know, a $90 payout across 30,000 zip codes compared to seven zip codes by, you know, XYZ solar in freaking Southern California. Like, and yeah, sure, they'll pay you $200 a call, which is awesome, but like you said, no standardization within buyer scripts or whatever. So, if you wanted to create an e-local and you wanted to build out a bisdev arm that's like solely focused on finding smaller clients to put together, no matter if it's insuranceances, no matter if it's legal, right? Because there's torch, there's MVA firms, there's everything you could think of that are all buying this traffic. So, ultimately it comes down to what do you want your buyer stack to look like and what would you ultimately like to build? Yeah. Interesting. So for you, I mean right now your main thing is broker, but like what is your cuz there there's the cash flow game. This is very simply put, but there's like the cash flow game and there's a potential for exit like machine game, right? And you can overlap on both of them. You can do that whole game, but like does the broker model sell? Like are there other people who buy your book essentially? Or is it more so if you want to go to this next layer? Is it you have your own in-house media buying team that runs your own basically brokered connections? So you guys make the spread there that you'd make as a media buyer and you make it here. Is it you go like you said e- local and you just go massive in this in between broker network game. Is it you know what's what's the endgame or options? So our endgame is following the path of assurance. So, Assurance sold for I think like $2.3 billion and their whole model started out as they were just a small little rinky dink marketing agency. At least this is what I was told that they were a small marketing agency and then they just started building on insurance sales floors and then they started building a fat ass book of clients, you know, like thousands of policies and then they got sold to credential for billions. So my goal now is I am sick and tired of like it's a really good way to make money and fast money as an affiliate, but I'm tired of chasing checks. Yeah. So what I want to do is I want to bring the control internally and I am f like because if I wanted to build out my media buying team basically what I would have to do is I would have to look at my media buying team in the face and say listen I know that you are about to compete with our our affiliates who are literally the most autistic and insanely cracked media buyers on this [ __ ] planet. I have in my helm and the people that we manage and the lead buyers or the media buyers that we have in our uh affiliate network are literally the best in the world. So I would have to go to my media buying team and be like hey guys yeah we got like you know 30 $40,000 a month you know for like you know a year maybe two years to like really figure this out and they're like okay this would be a David and Goliath play. So instead of me trying to build out and compete with these insanely high quality media buyers that have been doing this for years with super warm pixels, you know what I'm saying? They've got the incredible ad accounts. They have all of the best of the best of everything that you need for media buying. The insane video makers, the UGC's, everything you could think of, they already have. I would have to try to learn and replicate, which will take hella time. So me as a broker, I have two options. I can either a attempt to compete with the media buyers that I am currently running, which is almost low-key a conflict of interest, right? Because they have to submit their creatives to me. So, if they submit their creatives to me and I'm just like, "Hey, media buying team, here you go." Or they have to not trust me and then they're sending me nonreal the fake creatives. And if they're sending me fake creatives, now I'm submitting that to buyers. If [ __ ] gets now, it's a whole [ __ ] process. So honestly, me building out an internal media buying team is actually a conflict of interest that affects the people that are the very heartbeat of my organization. Yeah. So, if looking to compete with my affiliates, if I flip that around, which a lot of networks do, by the way, instead of doing that, if I can solely compete with these [ __ ] penthouse chilling nerds with managing relationships that they could never manage because if their [ __ ] Cheerios are flipped around in the wrong side of the cupboard, they're tripping balls. Imagine how it is with their campaigns and their money, right? So, if they're going to a buyer, hey, you guys aren't picking up the phone. And it's like, whoa, hey, [ __ ] you. We don't need you as an affiliate, like, go away. We're going to work with these other guys. That is where my value as a broker comes in because uh like specifically with the affiliates because now they can come to me and they know that Nate is going to protect them. Nate is going to go and find the biggest and the best buyers that we can connect to, the carriers, the massive [ __ ] name brand sales agencies. they can only they can just they know that Nate's going to pay them, right? That's the thing. Whereas buyers, they can trip, they can flip, it can just be a whole [ __ ] thing. So, if instead they can just work with me and then I can compete with them way better in terms of buyer management and buyer acquisition easy all day long. Like any of them, I will destroy them, right? Look, respectfully, no arrogance, all humility. That is just what I'm good at. So because of that, I would I would rather compete with them on that side and then manage them as affiliates and their media buying traffic and and work that way. So then now what my play is to sell is I'm currently in the process of building out a final expense sales floor. So Got it. like in person, real real team. No, virtual. But and and bro, we're gonna Man, that's I've seen some of those guys and I I assume it's the same, but there's definitely the Miami Penthouse kids that do that version too right now that are I think like, you know, down the pyramid, like second, third, down the rung, but then have these other like armies under them. But yeah, you go up that stack and like and like we already are, you know what I mean? Like I just I had a call with the largest provider of of contracts in the in the country this morning and I had the second largest yesterday. So, we're like having conversations like, "Look, we are a leading provider of the best final expense traffic in the game. I will have the lowest CPAs in the game for my salespeople. I will have the best traffic for those sales people. Like, my game is just poach as many final expense agents from other floors. Bring them on. Let them work virtually. Make sure that they're doing their [ __ ] Have the lowest CPAs in the game. I will make the most money out of out of everybody because I have the best traffic. I will get the best agents because in order to get the best agents, you have to do two things. provide the best [ __ ] traffic so they make the most money and close the most amount of deals. And two, provide them the best contracts and the best comp plan. And because I'm going to be at the [ __ ] top of the top, I'm going to get the best [ __ ] comp plan. You feel me? And I'm going to let let them just work from home because I already know that's the game. Like, sure, you can have a boiler room, you can have a floor. Yes, they're going to want to do it, but like one thing I've learned about my my entire company, it's only me and my business partner that are on shore, and we have a [ __ ] ton of staff that are offshore. The one thing I've learned is if you want to attract the best talent, you have to provide them the atmosphere that they that that talent wants to work in. And the reality is the best of the best talent does not want to [ __ ] dress in a suit and go to their office every single day. They won't sit in their pajamas and [ __ ] close deals and they will kill it. They will [ __ ] kill it. So, it's like that's what that's the atmosphere I want to create is like I don't care what you do. As long as you take the sales calls from 10 to 6 and you're closing [ __ ] policies and you're taking my leads, [ __ ] I have the best leads in the game. So, you're going to come and take my leads. It's like your ass is definitely going to be closing. You know what I'm saying? So that's Yeah. So that stack looks like So in an example that I had when I was doing these whole life ones, I got connected with a bunch of these people in this wrong and like my understanding of this was like right here, right? Like I just I didn't know what I didn't know. And we were running, you know, five to 10 calls a day, but they were these crazy high, you know, the it was massive commissions that were on these and very qualified. So it wasn't like this, you know, volume game. But I very quickly got introduced to some people that had, you know, 300 people on the floor and wanted it just flooded and but it would have been a different type of buy cycle. It would have been a paper call. It would have been like an inbound game versus like a book in like a VSSL book to call funnel, which is what I was running. Um, but so in that model, let's use that as an example so we don't fully dox your your your whole situation. But like let's say that that was I think annuities at the time is what they were basically using. So in an annuity thing, you would go to someone that has instead of you using their 300 person floor, you're going to go to them and you're going to provide that same thing, but you're going to have your own team under you essentially of actual live a like true agents that are true advisers that have their certifications that have their things. You guys are then going to have a deal with them where you get, you know, you're you're getting the lead flow, but you're also getting override or essentially whatever you're going to call it on that for them in this that industry specific. And you're going to manage the entire affiliate team as an external situation and you're going to do your own leads for your own team within this bigger organization. No. So, I'm setting up my entire independent organization. It's going to be my book. I'm going to own the book. I'm going to pay the salaries of the agents. I'm going to pay for the traffic for the agents. like everything like that is going to be managed on my side. Um and we will continue like in the cash flow of that team, right? Because my whole my whole mentality now literally is how can I pay for my new business by paying for it with other business. So like I was talking about with content. The reason why I wanted to go personal brand, but I also wanted to make sure that by when I'm doing the personal brand, I'm getting that [ __ ] paid for and I'm doing that from a community which I spent [ __ ] months building out the course content for. Right? So, if I can spend months building out the course content, monetize that, which is going to feed the the cash flow into the personal brand, which is then going to feed the cash flow into finding these agents, which is then going to feed, you know what I mean? Like it's just it's a whole we have a joke internally that's like, oh, like on the P&L, we're like, "Oh, yeah, let's let's rob Peter to pay Paul, but we also want to Paul like Paulina and Peter and whatever." Because it's like we need like if you make up this margin here, you like don't want to pay it all out. So, you got like rob all these people. But the other one of that is like you want to rob Nate Nate 1.0 to pay Nate 2.0, right? Like you're paying your next adventure into it and you're constantly just doubling down to self or other business which is yourself, right? Like that's interesting. So when how does that work with like licensing and regulation and all that cuz that's why I would envision you'd be under a bigger entity like you know I don't I don't know an example of this but like let's say All State or something which I understand is not that but like so you're not going to be under them as like some big kingpin that then has a a bunch of people under you when you're an independent agency. Don't you have to have all the licensing, all the regulation, all the compliance? Like, isn't that a big big deal? Oh, it's a huge deal. And like, you got to take it super seriously. Like, it's a it's a super legit thing, but like, man, you're not going to get bought out for hundreds of million dollars by, you know, no. By playing small, you're not by playing small. So, and like the good news is, bro, like another thing that I learned about business is just, man, take it slow. You know what I'm saying? Like, we can start out with literally one agent. We figured out I've got I've got already five six guys that like I'm that are like Nate please like let's go. So I'm going to start out with one maybe two agents. We're going to test out which traffic works the best with our specific offer. We're going to get them contracted. It's going to take a few months. Like I'm not planning on going from, you know, 0 to $100 million in in 3 months, right? I I have the realistic mentality now, which is like we're going to get the contracts that's going to take 3 to 6 weeks. Then we have to get people licensed under our contract. That's going to take another 3 to 6 weeks. So, we're 12 weeks out before we can even start selling policies. Now that we start selling policies, you know, we we're like, "Oh, wait. This is going to work. So, let's get two more agents. Now, we got a team of three." And then we go from 3 to 8 and then from 8 to 15. And then all of a sudden, we're like, "Holy [ __ ] we have 15 agents closing all these policies." Like, we're making money on the lead side. And then we're also making money with these agents building this out. Now, we can either see My bad. That was a fly. I thought there was like a cat like on my Columbia. Yeah, Columbia. You never know what's making it up. Yeah. I don't know why I thought a cat like could have just been a fly. I don't know. Um but anyway, so you know, you you can start out small and then you can kind of snowball it into creating something that's a lot more attractive to the type of people that you're trying to attract into your firm. And like bro, the LA like we're not like there I know who you're talking about. Those guys, you know, they're like 18 or they're like 23 years old. You know, they've got these these big personal brands. They're driving the [ __ ] Ferraris. You know, they're like, "Oh, come work for And all that is is to get a bunch of 18-year-olds to come in there, get licensed, you know, sell it a little bit. But like, bro, their average agent is doing like, you know,5 $6,000 a month in premiums. And like, bro, I want my agents doing 10 $15,000 a week in premiums. And so, what that means is I have to attract the best of the best. I'm not looking to, you know, run the personal brand where I'm getting a bunch of 18-year-olds that want to come in and figure out how to learn life insurance. I want to be like guy like I want to flip it. I want to be like guys I want the best of the best [ __ ] life insurance agents that want to come and work for me because I provide the best of the best leads. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And if that's what I can provide, I will attract the best of the best and I provide the best of the best work atmosphere and etc. etc. So yeah, we unfortunately we do have to do it super [ __ ] legit. And the days of running gray is just like gone gone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've never like bro you're doing millions of you know millions a year in you know revenue. Like if you're running great, man, it's just a ticking time bomb, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I've I've heard of some horror stories in the lead genen, black hat, whatever game. Like we've never played that ever. I mean, our stuff is very very, you know, very white. You know, it lays in that land, but I don't know. I mean, so what's the difference between that and something that's Have you guys ever done anything that's affiliate direct to cart style stuff? Because the other thing I've heard about an issue here is the quality assurance, the caps, which obviously you're you're balancing both, you know, rock and hard place there where you have caps or like availability or whatever. But for example, the Medicare stuff, like I was talking to some buddies, they're like, "Yeah, we just need more cap. We need more cap." They won't give it to us because it's too like we would have too much of their book to where it would be too much of a risk. It's not that the cap doesn't exist. It's that you almost have to do it other like other entity like trying to play this whole game. Like how do you see that with scale? versus something that's direct to cardart for these like affiliate guys. Yeah, the direct to cardart is fire. The you know the the ecom offers are [ __ ] fire for affiliates that want to run that [ __ ] The only problem is normally those offers don't last, right? Like you're like they may last they may [ __ ] crush for three, six, maybe eight months. Like you're just [ __ ] printing then it's gone, right? Life insurance, man, it's not going anywhere. Health insurance not going anywhere. auto insurance. You literally have to have auto insurance to be able to legally drive in the states, right? So, it's like these are like things that you have to [ __ ] have. It's not like solar how you're like, "Oh, I might get No, you have to have these insurance policies." So, or at least they're very much needed things like final expense. So, because of that, it's something that's going to be around forever. And even if you're doing smaller numbers, if you know that you're able to make a consistent, you know, 20 $50,000 profit a month running small caps on a Medicare campaign, that makes more sense to me as a business owner and as a CEO to run that for a shorter amount of time or for a long amount of time and then add in the other offers that you can pump and dump and then like, okay, yeah, this was great for 8 months, but it doesn't matter. The good news is we're still making 30 a month because we got this fire ass Medicare deal with this direct buyer. But the caps thing is very real. And to just kind of give some more context very quickly about why that exists is because the problem is if a a buyer has 300 salespeople and they give out a total cap, we'll call it CC. So CC is concurrent calls. So the amount of calls that you can have concurrently live at one time. If you have 300 agents, that means you have 300cc of availability. If you give 250cc to one affiliate and you've got 50 cc floating to, you know, two or three other affiliates, if that one affiliate decides, "Fuck you. I'm getting paid from somebody else way better. I'm just going to send that traffic elsewhere." Or, "Eh, I don't like you today. I'm just going to pause it." Or, "Oh [ __ ] all my ad accounts went down. We can't generate traffic." Now, you have 250 agents that you're paying salary that are no longer getting traffic. So, it is imperative that these Medicare companies diversify that cap, which is actually a good thing for affiliates because then you're not going to have the quote velocities that just come in and they take over literally the entire cap because they're just the behemoths and they're like, "Oh, yeah, no, we're just going to take all 300 and everybody else can, you know, I don't know, eat a dick, right? That's like it is what it is. Sorry." Right? So, that's that's where it really comes. It's actually a pro and a con. Um but you know either way Medicare is you know and then the insurance is man they they can make a lot of money especially during open enrollment man but then that is another thing is seasonality right so there's like two to three months uh like August September October the beginning well August September and then the beginning of October is just completely [ __ ] dead in Medicare and ACA because the open enrollment period. Yeah. So, have you been around when I think it was ACA and I again I don't know enough about this game in this space but you hear about the guys that crack it when one of these new programs comes out right that like are the first two and I don't know whether that's compliance regulation like you know they're the first allowed or if it's they're just the first to fire but I've heard of some major like you know nine figure windfalls that people are hitting when they are first to market or on the on the runner up so like do you guys stay privy to that like I don't know you know ACA is a good example. I know Medicare, you know, Obamacare, whatever. When those came out, there were some guys that cooked who had the initial stuff. Yeah. Like is there is there a game for that? Is there uh you just wait and see and then when it becomes a thing, you just hop on it or So that's Yes. Like basically ACA came about I don't know 3 5 years ago like heavily and the reason it came about heavily was because these guys were already selling Medicare. So it was the guys that already had been doing lead genen for Medicare. They had already had the relationships, you know, created and then all of a sudden ACA came as an opportunity and a couple of people I don't don't want to name names but a couple of people brought to light the opportunity of running ACA as an offer and then they contracted with the Medicare teams for them to start having the ACA agents and at this time it was still nobody knew about it. So you had like two to five insanely heavy hitter affiliates that are experienced with Medicare that just start running ACA and then they start [ __ ] smashing it, right? And they ran it up. So the reality is it all comes back to relationships, right? If you were the guy that had been doing Medicare for 2, three years with this one buyer and then they hit you up and say, "Hey, you're one of our leading providers. You provide good quality. You're always there. You stand by your word. You invoice us on time. you're not a headache. Like, we have this new offer we really want you to test. Like, I'll give you a [ __ ] ton of cap. Just smash this [ __ ] and make sure it performs well. And we're not giving it out to a bunch of people. Again, the only way you would get that is through developing that relationship. So, that's why I say this game is all about relationships. So, my problem, and I'd love to talk about my experience quickly with this, my problem, and the biggest lesson, brother. The biggest lesson I learned with business, sorry, somebody's grinding. The biggest lesson I learned with business is this. If all of the whales are doing something, if all of the biggest ships turn tide, follow the ships. Don't be that [ __ ] that's like, I'm I'm taking my little rowboat and I'm going this way because you know these Yeah, they're going to make my I'm going to figure out solar. I'm going to figure this out. I'm going to do this because this and then all of a sudden, guess what? There's a fat [ __ ] storm. And that is why those ships turn because that storm came down and it came down heavy and you are now floating in the middle with nothing because your boat is [ __ ] and you're cooked and your business is down. And that is what I did in ACA with inbounds is I was a transfer guy, right? So I was outbound dialing on data. We were generating transfers and we were sending them in. And I was [ __ ] determined, dog, that I was going to be the guy that makes ACA transfers go crazy. And we did. But nothing in comparison to the guys that did inbounds, bro. The guys that were doing inbounds, bro, they were running 100 150cc all day long, bro. They're doing [ __ ] millions a month. Like, they're like, "Oh yeah, we're going to hit $30 million in the next 6 months off this one ACA offer with these three ACA buyers. Like, there's just so much cap. There's so much demand. It's so hot on Facebook because everyone's like, "Whoa, $6,400 in health insurance subsidy? What the [ __ ] is that?" like I'm down. Everybody's calling. The like amount that it costs to generate that call was like a tenth of what it is now. So the margins were there. Everything was so sexy. But then there was little Nate that was like, "Oh no, I'm going to figure out this transfer thing." And I'm going, I'm trying to sell transfers to buyers. They're like, "We don't want it." The compliance, like we'd rather do inbounds. Do you have inbounds? I'm like, "No, I do transfers. Like I'm going to stick by my guns and do it cuz I'm just a [ __ ] hard head like that." But then again, it was honestly such a blessing in disguise that I learned that because just like people were making money, I knew a lot of people that got burnt a lot of bread. I'm talking M's dog. You know what I'm saying? And the worst part about it is if you're a broker and you're buying and reselling that traffic, you owe the affiliates. Like they sent you that traffic, you still need to pay that bill, but you didn't get paid. And if you have an 8 M bill that just gets stiffed and you're like, uh, hey guys. Uh, I got some bad news for you, you know, like I [ __ ] I don't have $8 million for you. I'm [ __ ] sorry. So, you know, and we've been that we've been in that happened with our transfers. We had a really shitty situation about two years ago now where we had a really bad call come in. who was a litigator, so we got sued and then, you know, I I owed almost $400,000 and like we were doing, you know, good money, but like I didn't have $400,000 to pay out to my affiliates. So, you have to have those really hard conversations. And again, it all comes down to relationships. You know, there was like I probably had like seven different affiliates were running it. Two of the affiliates were really large and I was very comfortable with them and calm with them and I called them and I'm like, "Man, this is what happened. We're not going to get paid for 12 months." And they were like, "Fuck, like, do you got anything for me?" And I'm like, "I can give you like 30 right now." And like, "I'm that's putting me in a horrible spot. I don't know how I'm pay my rent, but like I know I owe you a lot of bread. I'm just going to get you that 30 and I'm going to let me figure out the rest. And I'm sorry. I know I owe you [ __ ] 212, but I can only give you 30 right now. And like hang in there with me. Every month I'm going to pay or like come up with an agreement, whatever that looks like, and you just hang in there with your affiliates." So to answer your question, sorry again, long story is like, you know, can these offers hit? [ __ ] yeah, man. Absolutely. But just just know who you're in bed with. Just know who you're in bed with and understand that every every business has a risk, bro. And like, dude, you're just generating traffic. Like, it's not like you're out here building a [ __ ] building. You know what I mean? Like, you're literally just running traffic on Facebook. So, if you get cooked, like, you got to just know like this is the game, you know? You flip some levers, dog, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So, let's talk the depth of one of these and then I want to pick your brain on some specifics and be selfish here, but so like ACA for example, the chain of that like of who's getting paid because I've been I have friends that are in your world. I we have a lot of mutuals and like I again I've done some marketing tech in that game. I've been part of a lot of conversations, but like I've never I've actually run like 20 25 a day and someone else's that basically had all the stuff needed more ads on uh needed more eyes on ad accounts because they had so much going on and they were just boys and I was like yeah I'll go do that. But like again none of my own creatives, none of my own assets, none of my own target like they were just like just watch this basically watch this and spend 20 grand a day like it'll work and it'll work. Yeah. Um but so in the ACA game in that to my understanding there were the media buyer guys. Yeah. And there's a a lot of multi different directions here. So you could go through broker, you could go through network or you could go direct, right? Yep. Then of that sometimes these direct ones almost even have brokers that are like inousy, right? Is that like and then who is buying who is this endall? Because then it goes to what? It goes to a call center which is like an agency and then the agency is then getting paid when they to government like how like what is the full-on chain for ACA? Got it. like where's the end all be all money and the and the starter. So the reason why they're the reason why ACA and Medicare are regulated is because they're governmentfunded. So the taxpayers pay their taxes into the government. The government then does whatever God knows happens to that money, right? But part of that is funding Medicare and ACA programs. Medicare and ACA programs are essentially, for those that don't know, health insurance that is highly subsidized by the federal government. So essentially, the federal government is paying into large funds that are then being dispersed accordingly to cover people on programs. So what one thing that we know is never ever ever [ __ ] with the government's money, right? You can [ __ ] kill somebody and get 17 years, but god damn it, you don't pay your taxes for 10 and you're avoiding. You're going for 25, right? Like, don't play with the government's money. So, the reason why that's important is because the the the hierarchy is you have the government that funds the ACA carriers. The ACA carriers are the ones that work with the government to um negotiate to figure out how much they can get paid from the government per month per user that is contracted with their contract of the insurance that that carrier provides. Right? So think Etna, think Blue Cross Blue Shield. Those are carriers. Those carriers do have internal sales like offices. But then also on top of that you have the government funding. You have the carrier which provides the contracts. But then you have the select quotes, the transacts, the e- healths. Those are the sales agencies. The sales agencies contract directly with the carriers. They don't work with the government, right? They work with the carriers. And the carriers say, "Okay, listen, select quote. You guys are going to have this XYZ Medicare plan. We're going to comp you $1,200 on a, you know, ninemonth advance. We're going to comp you every time you enroll a new a new client with a new policy holder. We're going to comp you X amount. And now, mind you, that carrier is comping that to the sales agency who writes the policy for that carrier. But that carrier is getting funded from the government, right? So what happens is you have the lead generator that generates the call and that call can go to a broker or that call can go directly or that call could go to a broker that goes to a broker that goes to a broker that ends up going to the buyer which is very [ __ ] commonplace because again everything comes down to relationships and everybody just wants more [ __ ] cap. So, even if that means you're going to have, you know, a lower RPC, if you're at least breaking even or you're making a little bit of money, even a dollar a call, man, run it a thousand times a day and you'll make a thousand bucks a day. Like, it doesn't matter. But yes, maybe you're going to have a direct relationship. You're making $8 per call and that's making you a [ __ ] ton more. But again, you can layer in the different buyers where that and so that's that's essentially the ecosystem. But the reason why Medicare and ACA are not necessarily the most stable is because affiliates will run dirty [ __ ] angles like super black hat, super gray hat, get a $500 credit card by calling this phone number, right? So then they call the phone number and then that goes to the broker that goes to the sales agency. They close that deal and then the problem is this ultimately the problem was this and Medicare well we can talk about ACA first. The problem was we had people that were signing up for an insurance plan on a Monday, right? And then on a [ __ ] Tuesday, the day after, they see another ad and it says, you know, maybe they signed up for an ad that says, "Get $6,400. It doesn't matter if you've already claimed these benefits. Just see if you can qualify for more benefits." So then you had these affiliates that were smart and what they did is they categorized callers on a no dupe. So basically a no dupe means no duplications. and if they had no duplicates. So what they would do is they would sell it to buyer A on a Monday, right? That caller would come in and then they'd sell it to whoever the highest bidder was, but then they'd be keep on running traffic and they're retargeting and that same [ __ ] person will call in, but they will make sure that it's dduped with any of their current buyers. They may have six different buyers in their stack. So what happens is this person calls in on a Monday, they enroll. They call in on a Tuesday. Now it's going to buyer B instead of buyer A because maybe that's just how the [ __ ] cookie crumbles. Now this person's getting signed up with a new insurance provider, right? So now they're they're signing up. So now it's called a flip. So now they're flipping from one carrier to the next carrier. And the craziest part is the sales agency gets paid no matter how long that person stays on the books for that advance. Right? And this this was like at the beginning of the time and same thing with Medicare. So all of a sudden with Medicare, which I know a lot like more in depth on, Medicare got [ __ ] because what was happening is the uh the onshore and the offshore call centers were running outbound dialing on Medicare data and their angle was always just see if you can get better benefits. Like yes, I know you're already on a Medicare plan. That actually means you're qualified for a Medicare plan. Let's just have you talk with a sales agent to see if you can get a better plan. Now, the reality is senior demographic, if you know anything about the senior demographic, they always want to save money. Their number one thing is just saving money. So, if you call somebody on a Monday and you're like, hey, you know, do you want to save money on a Medicare plan? And they're like, yes. And then they get transferred over and they close. And you call them on a [ __ ] Tuesday. Or even more dirty, you call them an hour after you know they just closed and you say, "Hey, I know you just talked to the sales agent, enrolled in a new Medicare plan, but I actually have another person you might want to talk to that might get you a better plan." And then they get transferred and the Medicare agents, they're just trained to close policies. So like they just want to provide the best plan. And so what they'll do is like they may be two different plans, right? Let's just talk about two different Medicare plans. One Medicare plan might be $5 a month for a Medicare Advantage plan. It might be $5 a month with XYZ benefit, right? And then there may be another plan that they can offer which is $10 a month with three times the benefits. And they may be currently enrolled with the three times the benefit offer, but then the sales agent wants to close that policy. So they're like, you know, I know you're getting better benefits, but like you could be saving $5 a month, and I think you should save $5 a month. So, they're enrolling in these [ __ ] competing plans that they still qualify for. And the the the main problem was twofold. Number one, financially, where the carrier was paying the sales agency, and then they're getting flipped. And then that same carrier is paying another sales agency for that same [ __ ] person. So, now this person is being paid for by the carrier dozens of times, bro. And the sales agencies, they're making up their money and they're just crushing it, right? Yeah. But the main problem out of everything is this. [ __ ] the financial. We had Grandma Suzie that was walking into the pharmacy for her to go and get her diabetes medication. And she'd pull out her insurance card and she'd slap it down and she'd say, "Okay, I'm ready for my my uh my my prescription." And they'd run it in their little system and they go, "Susie, you're not you're not currently insured with Anthem. I don't know who you're insured with, but in our system, this is no longer an active policy. And she's going, I I Okay, well, I'll figure it out, but I need my diabetes pills. And she's going, okay, that'll be $745. And she's like, I how the [ __ ] am I supposed to pay that? And they're like, I don't know, but you need an insurance policy, so go ahead and call. So now Grandma Susie has to leave. And now she's trying to call every [ __ ] phone number to try to figure out who the [ __ ] am I insured by because she's literally talked to seven different agencies in the past month, right? And this was a serious [ __ ] problem. It was a serious [ __ ] problem as you can imagine. Blood pressure pills, diabetes, [ __ ] memory, like everything you could think of. Like these seniors were actually being taken advantage of. And so, yes, people made a ton of money, including myself, but we didn't run like that, right? We we worked with different kinds of partners, but this [ __ ] happened. So, that's why ultimately people were getting take advantage of. And on top of that, the government funding was getting [ __ ] with. So, because of both of those things, Medicare got nerfed. Because of those things, ACA got nerfed, right? And right now, most of the people that are selling ACA as a call center, they're not even considering selling ACA like by the end of the year. They're thinking books are going to be dried up and done before the end of the year, bro. Interesting. Yeah, they're running so many pulled out of providing insurance policies. Like they completely pulled out, bro. Like they're not even do like if Etna Etna huge. They pull out, bro. Get the [ __ ] And then um I I forget the the name. There's Alliance or something like that. I just heard through the wind that they Alliance was a huge funding partner for a lot of ACA floors and they completely pulled out. They stopped the funding. Like that's bro. Yeah, it's so interesting talking to the people in different spaces. I mean, a lot of the guys I end up talking to are in my world and this info coaching thing and I could talk for 12 hours about different funnel types and backends and frontends and like everything's in-house or this or partnerships, but this bigger like this is just like a whole different game, right, to to me. So, what you guys are creating then in that hierarchy is going to be more so the sales agency style of like this. Yeah, that's badass. Yeah. So, we're going to be building the sales agency and we're getting the contracts directly from the carriers or we're going to work with another company that's contracted that will get us better contracts than if we went direct. Yeah, that's the thing, right? If you It's the same thing with networks, right? A lot of times guys are like, "Why would I run into a network when I can run direct as like a lead lead provider?" Well, maybe because that network has been working with that buyer for [ __ ] three years. They have hella traffic. They have proven quality. And so, they can actually offer you better payouts than if you were to go directly and be like, "Hey, I want to sell you calls." They may be like, "Yeah, I don't know. we have to test your quality. We give you 30 bucks a call. Whereas, if you go to the direct network or you go to the the network, they've been working with them forever. They're like, "Oh, yeah. We actually get paid 60, so we can offer you 50 and you'll make money by work making more money by working with the [ __ ] network." Also, payment terms. Networks may be more prone to give you like a weekly net 7 compared to like a monthly net 30 that you'll get from the direct buyer because they just want to aggregate the traffic and make Yeah, absolutely. Wow. Yeah, this is mad interesting. You know what I mean? Like there's just a whole lot. No, no, no. There's I like this whole hierarchy thing I always talk about here like everything's a funnel and like how deep can you take it like how far can you go and like the endgame of there is you you know you own a neta or you're the government right like if you go up the hierarchy but like unrealistic but like how far do you want to take it do you just want to be a media buyer and you want to make your millions a year and you want to be the best of the best you want to go this next rung and not necessarily even an income but like down the up the ladder down the ladder whatever and do broker do you want to do sales agency do you want to do like there's just levels to this stuff and we talk about that in info and coaching it's like that generally It's how big is your back end? So like these guys that do info and coaching around wealth management or around taxation. They have a profitable front end. They have an info coaching business that makes 4x rorowaz, let's call it, right? They do 20 million bucks a year and like that's their game. But where they make this all this money on the back end is they're a financial adviser. They're a fiduci they're a fiduciary. They have partners that are wealth managers or u uh family offices or insurance policies or like all this game of that and they make tens of millions over here. That's just boom. like it's just straight profit, right? Like all of this is ad spend, team, whatever you've got to run your info coaching, but then this and ours is like, you know, fulfillment stacks. Is there supplement? You know, there there's these other things there, but nowhere nowhere like this. Yeah. So, do you have a couple minutes? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, selfish, very curious. Yeah. I've been so interested in this game for so long. I have dabbled. I have, you know, done the thing. I have never done it where I bring in partners or do it in that way. I've either book I've either been the partner that's brought in, right? Like I'm a co-owner, not a co-founder of this info coaching game and I have been, you know, paid well and done some fun stuff in the lead genen game, but it's always been like a spiff of what I'm doing. So, is there what is the lean model? What is the game plan that if you were to start, would you, if you're me and I'm like, "Okay, cool. I want to do this side quest and I want to build this team." Like, is it a is it a media buyer, a creative, and just partner up with a broker? Is it uh get a bisdev guy and start to try and go some version of direct and basically build something that's doing let's target 100k a month in profit let's say like what what's the model that you would run for someone like that. So 100k a month in profit divided by 20 working business days $5,000 a day in profit $5 per call if you're you you're not wanting to do the broker you want to generate internally. Yeah, because I'm thinking I'm thinking that would be a more because then the other game of this is like how scalable is it and then where is their actual like potential exit value because I know some of the guys that were in the mid 10s that have sold and they had a bigger kind of crew but they were generating but they also they had direct relationships at that point. And I'm sure they did some broker, but like they had that, but they had guys going out like teaching call centers how to do the certain scripts. Like they were at some level end to end, but they built up a book that was then, you know, and the machine of acquisition on the front that they could sell that entire thing and like that's a notch on the belt. I want I think we're going to go that direction in phone coaching, but like I have friends that are doing this that I could partner with. I have myself that, you know, has some bandwidth as this opens up. I'm just curious. As I said earlier, I would say that the best thing that you can do if you're looking to generate because if you were looking to broker like we do, I would say the first thing is find the traffic. So, if you already have the cuz like it's kind of like this. If you get a phone call from a good friend and he's like, "Dude, I have this crazy play. We should go to Colombia and we should meet with the [ __ ] top cartel and we should move a ton of coke." And you're like, "Yeah, we'll make millions." And then you hop on a flight and you go meet up with this drug lord and you're like, "Don't worry, Pablo. We're going to get you all the cocaine you could dream of." And he's like, "Okay, great." And then you turn around, you go, "Okay, where do we get this coke?" And now, like, you know what I'm saying? Like, you're like, "I uh fuck." If you go to a buyer and you're like, "Dude, I can get you the best [ __ ] calls in the world. It's going to crush." And then you turn around, you're like, "Where are the calls?" Then you're cooked, right? So, if you're looking to be a broker, always find the traffic first. If you're a media buyer and you want to generate the traffic yourself, go and find the buyers. Find somebody that like and take your time, you know? Don't feel like you got to spin up really quick with a network cuz you just want to see if it's going to work. It will work. It will obviously [ __ ] work. We know there's plenty of people that will make it work. The question is, how good is your relationship, right? How good can it work? Not only will it work, but how good will it work? So, I would go and find the buyer and I'd talk to him and I'd find a direct buyer and I'd say, "Listen, you have 20 agents, you have 40 agents, you have 300 agents, whatever it is. This is who I am and what I can provide and this is what I've done so far to show what I'm capable of. I would love nothing more than to be a very high quality lead uh or call generation source for you to depend on. That call generation source that you know is going to consistently provide highquality traffic. Your agents are going to be happy when they see my traffic come in. Um, you know what I'm saying? They're going to close a lot of deals. You're going to make a lot of money. You have consistently low CPAs. That is who I want to be for you. What I need you to be for me is X, Y, and Z. I need you to pick up the phones. I need you to give me a static line. I need you static payout. I will do everything for you. And even if you're down, bro, I'll give you a free $3,000 test. Like, I'll run traffic. I don't give a [ __ ] about $3,000. If this is something we can seriously do together and if you'll take me seriously, I'll give you a free test. And once you see my traffic is really fire and it outco competes some of your other sources, maybe not everybody, but some of them, then I want you to give me more cap and I want to grow with you. And then after you get that one relationship established and stabilized, then it's so easy to go find other partners. And bro, you just play them on the competition game. You're like this. Hey, Mr. Go Health. Um, we're actually currently selling to Select Quote and we have like a $300 CPA with them and they're super [ __ ] happy and I'd love nothing more than to diversify our partner list and I've actually heard that you're really good as a client. So, I would love nothing more than a scale with you and if you're willing to pay me $5 more per call, I'll give you all of Go Health's traffic or I'll select I don't remember who I'll give you your competitor's traffic. And then they're like, "Oh, really?" And you're like, "Yeah." and they're like, "Fuck it." And then you have another buyer. Like, and then and then you just [ __ ] stack and you stack and you stack, bro. And if you have all of your [ __ ] compliant, you have your processes in place, you can show them real data in terms of KPIs and CPAs and, you know, everything, bro. It's not hard. It's really not because like I I I was just on a consulting call yesterday with this guy who's been trying to find buyers, right? And he sends me screenshots and he goes, "Man, I just don't know what to say when I get on the call." And so, we did consulting about that. But the thing is is bro, if you just le reach out to these people on LinkedIn, hey, this is what I'm offering and in in my school group, which I I don't know if you watch that part of the course if you want, I can see the the thing. But the point is I have a whole like the perfect [ __ ] outbound message, which is literally like, "Hey, Mr. Buyer, this is I heard your company is looking for more XYZ kind of traffic. We're currently generating this traffic with XYZ CPA. I'd love nothing more than to to test, you know, working with you and see if we're going to be a great partner in traffic. Are you open to this, bro? It's the easiest [ __ ] sale. You're not asking for 50 G's upfront. You're not telling them, "Oh, yeah, we want to build you a website and, you know, do this creative and all the [ __ ] that most retainer agencies have to sell on." You're like, "Do you want me to give you leads for free?" They're like, "Why not?" And then next thing you know, you have a [ __ ] contract, bro. Like literally, it's that like the thing is about paper call is selling is actually super [ __ ] easy as long as you make it easy for yourself and as long as you have real [ __ ] to sell. It's really not hard to sell. Like I'll give you a free $3,000 test. Do you want it or no? And they're like, "Fuck it. Sure." Yeah. You know what I mean? Like what's the worst that could happen for them? It's a $3,000 test. If it works really well, boom, they've got a great new lead provider. If it sucks, either a you suck as immediate buyer and you can go to them and be like, "My bad. Give me another test. I I figured out what I did wrong. and I didn't qualify properly on the landing page. My bad. And then you're out a,000 bucks and you do it again and then boom, you got the [ __ ] account. You know what I mean? And now you can do $100,000 a week with them. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. No, it's super interesting. Um Yeah. I'm I'm dancing with this idea back and forth. I've got this kid that's local that's, you know, I want to do something. I want to do something. I'm like, I I don't, you know, you can't fit in the main co for what this is, but there's all these other opportunities that just come to me all the time. And I'm like, okay, that's interesting. So yeah, maybe it's the broker route and then and then go from there. And then if you want to run internal, you do. And like you said, you you know, conflict of interest potential if you just fill like I just I actually made a tweet earlier. I guess what do you call an X? I don't know, dude. I was talking about this for I was talking about this all last week like with my friends joking. I was like, am I tweeting still or am I exing like Yeah. Like is this just I just made an X? That's weird. Yeah, it doesn't roll. It doesn't roll. We're going to stick with tweeted. So I tweeted earlier today. Let me just read this tweet really quick because I think this will also really help. Um especially like bro I I cuz yesterday I was asked this question on a consulting call. He's like man like just where do I start? So this is my tweet. I said if I was to completely restart my paper call journey and wanted to make $4,500 per day in profit uh as quickly as humanly possible. I would focus on finding a fire inbound call lead generator. I would structure a referral deal with said call generator at $3 per billable call. I'd talk to that guy and I'd be like, "Yo, dog, I'm going to find you buyers. I'm going to close the deals. All I ask is that you give me $3 per billable call." I would find three buyers in that call generators vertical who can take 500 billable calls per day. It's not that many calls. And then I would do 1,500 billable calls per day across the three different buyers at 500 billables times $3 per billable. and my brother in Christ, you're already at 400 or $4,500 per day in [ __ ] profit that you are not spending money on. And then at the end, I said, "If I'm a [ __ ] and I can do it, I promise you can do it." Yeah. Important important case note, you know, point case. So that's the reality is it may make more sense for you if you want to build good rapport with your buyer. You may just be like, "Hey, call Jen dude that's near me. Young kid, I know you can crack it." Once you have it dialed, maybe you already have it dialed. If you already have it dialed, I'm going to introduce you to this buyer because I spent, you know, a couple weeks turning some stones and finding some buyers. And I promise for you and you're already development network, I guarantee you if you make a couple posts or you start asking some people, somebody knows a [ __ ] good insurance agency. Like they're everywhere. There's so much money. And if you roll with people that make money, they're always like my bro, I have like three or four really good friends that I sell traffic to. We started out as friends and I'm like, "Oh, wait. You do insurance?" They're like, "Yeah, yeah, I have an insurance floor." And I'm like, "Dude, I sell Medicare calls." And he's like, "Oh, [ __ ] Let's do it." Right? So, it's like if you're working or hanging out with people that already have money, odds are either them or one of their friends has an insurance agency. So, it may make sense for you to have that conversation, find somebody that's willing to buy. Then you go to somebody that's already generating that you know is fire. And you tell them, I'm just going to connect you directly. Don't you dare [ __ ] me and just pay me $3 per billable call, bro. And then then you can learn the model. You can see it real time. You can understand the problems that will will arise from it. And it's always [ __ ] something different. It's all it's every business has its ups and downs and every business has its problems. It's all about what problems do you want to solve, right? So, at the end of the day, like if you just connect them directly and you just make a couple bucks on it, bro, you're not doing [ __ ] It's all profit and you get to learn the model. Yeah. No, it's beautiful. You feel me? Yeah. No, I definitely feel you. Yeah. I I'm going to connect with you after on this because I have some interesting stuff around there. But yeah, I mean we have pieces of that whole puzzle already and it's like the bigger thing and to anybody who already listens to this knows like we are scaling so heavily right now with the info coaching to the point that it's like is this distraction? Yes, for sure. But is it like interest mapping and fun and like is there overlap? Yes. So like I maybe can justify but this was my this was my interest scratch and also my like it I I didn't need those every once in a while. I need those. And then as I continue to scale out of this, I want to be able to remove where the time spent and then also test the partnership model which I've never done. I've always been the one who's in it, boots on the ground clicking the keys to make something work. And I have so many friends and I'm sure like you know you included where you have you make spiffs over here and here and here like you just said through relationship. I had Eddie Malof on here and he's like oh yeah and this and this and this and he's got you know nine deals and I'm like but you run the agency. He's like, "Oh, yeah, but that was, you know, either a little capital or a couple conversations or a buddy who did this and I just help with it and like he's got this chunk and this chunk and this chunk and partners and I'm like, "Yeah, that's something I just haven't I don't have the skill set of yet." And it's something I would like to have at end of Yeah. And like as you know, scaling is kind of boring. Like scaling can be boring. Yeah. It can it kind of gets bor like it's cool and then all of a sudden you'll have these little plateaus. You're like, "How do we get past plateaus?" And then you figure it out cuz you're a good businessman and then you're like, Yeah. which I'm trying to be like that's yeah you know your your ship comment right it's like stay in just stay in the ship just stay directionally focused and like but that focus thing is so real so I'm navigating that but like I just love to learn about these things and I know there's a play to be made it's just if it's now it's if it's if it's with a partner it's how it's structured so cool man all right well where do where do people find you got funny handles on stuff yeah so Billy Nate on Instagram and on Twitter uh Nate Anslit on YouTube. Um, like seriously, if like if any of your viewers want to like learn about this, um, start with my YouTube. Um, I have a ton like I have like five really solid videos. You'll probably hear a lot of the same things, but it was a lot of information I provided on this call. So, like like go watch the YouTube videos. I [ __ ] took a long time to make them. Like, even if it doesn't look like it, it's a lot of work. Um, I you know, we did that. And then if it's still some if it's something that you're actually interested in like learning more about, bro, I have a $27 [ __ ] course, bro. Like, hop in it, learn it. And then, like I said, I also built a sexy community. We have over 300 people in there now. And like, just go in there, learn how to do it. Once you learn how, work with the people who are also like learning it, working on it, trying to find buyers, trying to find sellers. Bro, there's so many good, highquality people in that group. And like I moderate it, so if anybody comes to me and they're like, "Oh, hey, this guy's kind of shady." I immediately hop on that a call with a person, make sure everything's good, make sure it's quality, because the last thing I want is some [ __ ] [ __ ] going on in my group. You know what I mean? If it does happen, they're immediately kicked. It's like audio. But luckily, that still hasn't happened. So, yeah. And I can vouch for both those. I mean, like I said, I'm a I'm a buyer of information access things. I always do it. Always have. Um I think I even got in when you were doing your higher gated thing. Like, I don't know. I was just like, I'm in. Uh and yeah, the I ripped through it in a weekend. It's concise, but it's like packed with info on how to do it. And I didn't understand the broker game before that. I only knew the the buyer like you know media buyer side of it. So it Yeah. And then I just got into the group and it's a bunch of killers in there. So it's funny. That's the other cool thing about it is a lot of media buyers or people that want to learn to generate what I'm hearing from them because there are people obviously that are joining and then leaving and I'm asking every single person that leaves I said man I just want to make this the best possible community. Like can you tell me why is it that you're leaving? I don't care. Like it's fine of course all love but why are you leaving? And the biggest thing I'm hearing is people that are going, "Well, because I want to learn how to generate the traffic. I don't want to learn how to broker it." But the reality is, I also teach how to sell that traffic. And the reality is selling is [ __ ] I told you it's all relationships, right? So it's like even if you're like, "Oh, I don't want to, you know, I don't need to learn how to generate. I already know how to generate." Get in there and learn how to sell it. Learn how to position yourself. Like I said, like if you hit somebody up on LinkedIn, you're like, "Hey, I'm looking to sell calls." bro, you're going to be lost in the wind. But if you're like, "This is what I'm doing. I heard your company is this. This is our CPAs, et." And you break it down exactly like I tell you, bro, your your like success rate is going to be so much higher because here's one thing. Nobody wants to be sold anything. But we're all down to partner. Yeah. We're all down to partner and make money. It doesn't matter if you're you or me or the biggest [ __ ] carrier in the world. If there's a partnership opportunity where you're going to make me money and we're going to grow, they want it. We all want it. Just don't [ __ ] sell. Like if you're on your like, "Oh, I'm gonna sell." I'd be like, "Get the [ __ ] out of here, bro. This is what I'm on the call for. I'm here to provide value to you and your viewers, right?" So, sorry. But anyway, no, no, no, no. It's solid. So, cool. Yeah. No, definitely definitely people check that out and you and I will be in contact after this and we'll probably have some follow-up ones with some funny stories. Yeah, sounds good, my brother. Well, I appreciate you and thank you for bringing me on here and I'm glad I could, you know, give some sauce, bro. I look forward to helping whoever the [ __ ] comes from here. Sauce is real. Right on.
