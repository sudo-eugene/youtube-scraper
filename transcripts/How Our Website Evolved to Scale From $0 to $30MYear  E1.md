## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6y1pFRv4y4

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the platform and off Revolution that we use to do 70 million in cash collected on a call funnel um so not Revenue cash collected and I found a video of myself doing this uh when we were at about this phase right here and we had done about 10 million in cash collected so since then we've done about 60 million um between these two so um today just going to go over basically the offer we're running and the website funnelish but mainly the website that we were using at the time so future videos we'll have different pieces of operations team Tech scaling how we've done everything and then basically just like what's working now as we evolve because there's a bunch of big changes actually happening right now to bring us into a new level more or less um but I'm going to go through kind of where we came from in regards to this so initially we're running a $27 a month app um so it was a 7-Day free trial and then push into a 7day I'm sorry a yeah free 7-Day trial $27 a month there's an OT for $147 um and this was really popular at the time to do and Facebook costs were slowly increasing but people were trying to make it work long story short is we were not uh we were doing like 30k day or I'm sorry 30k a month uh in and out so it was not good um So eventually we were like all right let's move this thing over to a call funnel um and from there we moved over to Wordpress um so this is basically it's had some weird update since but this is basically what we were running so at this time this was more of an oven model model um and had all focus on consumption so it was all about reviews it was all about uh what can they consume prior to getting on the sales call um so that we have a higher chance of doing so so at this time right we had just evolved from this and gone into vssl call funnel so at the time it's optin watch vssl application book a call thank you page and then all the emails and all the things behind there pushing them to consume before we then pitch them on the phone right because all these are coming from cold ad and with a mid to high ticket thing you definitely want them to have consumption so the calls aren't just you know at 5% all in all sales per booking so at the time uh this offer was an info product so it was kajabi hosted course it had group coaching calls and a community so very simple classic stack and we started off by testing at 497 and this was five years ago maybe now at this point four or five years ago so so tested at 497 and started doing 80k months then 100K then 200 and something then 400 and just like up to the right so this is how we hit our first million dollar months is right here um so that was all on this platform using Wordpress um and again the text doesn't actually matter which is the funny part like the website doesn't matter you could do it on clickfunnels you could do it on webflow um this is just what we used at the time because for us it was like oh we want really want to push resources and have content heavy so that there's more or less like a flywheel they can just exist on um so this side's a little slower now because it's on like a backup version um but essentially this was the gist right is like finally have things that have ctas on them like you know sticky ctas and just like longer form pushed consumption with just when they're done they roll into the next thing so this is the site that we used to do 60 something million right here so it looked a little prettier since like broken with plugins and stuff but it was rough it was rough no doubt so uh the actual funnel itself is also on here so on just Standalone pages so the opt uh vsls app booking and thank you are on here just on the back of the site or on you know solo Pages not necessarily linked out from the front um but yeah so this is kind of the the gist so over that time um we went to this and then we actually added in these two as well while still on WordPress okay so the offer changed but then the entire platform stayed the same because it didn't need to so it was really even close to the same vsl and the same style we just changed what we were selling and that alone was like right there uptick because we had never gotten over I believe one probably like 1.2 maybe is selling the uh info product and it was one time access so margin was good in terms of no fulfillment but margin was not good in terms of no retention no future money and the ticket being lower right so we decided to transition over to one to one coaching so at that time when we moved over to one toone coaching we really had like a skeleton team of like actual coaches to fulfill on it um so it was us in the background doing it um and mainly the brandace and founder at the time uh was leading that department but so over time this took over the entire company so this became like only thing we could sell only thing we would sell and we got rid of this info product and completely just phased it out we transitioned over this this is when we started doing one two three almost four we never we never hit four as of whatever it is March 25 uh we haven't hit four a month yet but we were steady state in that range and across that time we used to sell this for like $300 a month it was crazy um and then over that time we've just transitioned out so it's annual only recurring programs um thumbs up uh it's annual only recurring programs it is $7,200 a year in current form with financing options that would make it more than $7,200 uh inhouse so you know like three pays two pays stuff like that and then we also have external financing where you just throw 1,000 bucks on on top of the ticket just because you have to cover feed and do all that kind of stuff so yeah it's the general gist and then this is where we transition to as of 2025 early and this is much more the feel of what we're going for so this is branded like no other this is the style we want all the graphics everything is up to date um The Funnel itself is actually also on here on the back end um but yeah so the whole like got just like this crazy overhaul so same goal and same idea just for the better look right so consumption very focused on keeping people in this flywheel of being able to you know they call that flywheel but you understand what I mean um in the blog so that they can just keep consuming content we have macros mindset andopa muscles and then each one's broken down by reads and watches so all the YouTube videos end up on here like but this is just a classic example working we're constantly changing things video description here is is terrible for search so we're rebuilding these um with AI to have like full proper headlines sub headlines and information based on transcripts throughout these videos because we have so much content um and then yeah CTA all throughout all pushing to apply and then this is where they enter basically middle of funnel so um which at some levels top of funnel but so add optin vssl application this is that application so people who are already on the site idea being they have as much consumption at some level and they could come in here directly so yeah so then they apply book a phone call and then all future videos where we have like crazy stuff for routing and qualifications and going to sets here soon versus going to closers directly and all that kind of jazz but yeah so that's kind of the general gist and then the other piece of the set I did want to show because it's very important uh or has a ton of views is this review section so we broke the reviews into Transformations which is basically images of before and afters and then um video reviews which this is generally speaking the highest performing part of the site and these are just popups with different videos we try and get them all in one format but it's a little tough uh with the market to get them all consistent but yeah so these are the most highly trafficked portion of the website and then also the highest converting and then client interviews this is where we're putting a lot of effort in just for more consumption with the same output or with the same style right so it's like literally women directly going through their exact Journey um and the ones that get feed on these end up becoming clients right so like if someone watches these and watches a handful of them and assuming they check XYZ box and they're good fit and now we're actually going to like allow them into the program then um they buy like almost every time so but funny enough on this just a quick little thing I did a like a long split test of this page versus this page or just having this is the default versus this is the default and this one outperformed by almost double so people being able to come in here and get quick feedback on this and then lead into doing an application which is what we were optimizing for at the time so basically if they come from search if they come from so branded search paid or um just kind of some of the other pieces like an email and retargeting if they come to this page and it's this versus this it is double the amount of people then went into application book a call and then purchase right you just got to assume the downflow so yeah pretty cool um but this is a Non-Stop Evolution um we still use we don't use WordPress for anything we still use click funnels for order forms that's what it all about that's why we do that uh which isn't really the best necessarily um but we use it for all the sales rep order fors but yeah so that's kind of the general gist and much much much more to come um I agreed that I would go through and start sharing all the stuff like as we build uh I found a bunch of old videos earlier this month that were basically me doing this but just never publishing them and going through them and I wish I would have because again we had done five million when I started making first ones and then 10 and then we just jumped to 70 basically and with the new Evolution where I'll be able to talk on soon but we've never done anything low ticket like direct with at scale we did very initial so low ticket mid ticket so either direct to cart uh webinar flows challenge flows and then having all that more or less on the front end of the company with this on the back end so yeah it'll be fun Evolution and I look forward to the update where I can have three digits here and some other fun stuff so hopefully three digits a year so that's the target but yeah uh feel free to comment or message me anywhere and uh I'm just going to keep posting these of different pieces of tech operations sales just growth overall and like what we're doing now and what we've done past so enjoy
