# this is how we track out $70,000,000 funnel (full breakdown) | E7
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYKcJ8Z8GVQ

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through a call funnel 1.0 tracker this is a very similar setup we use to track and do 30 million cash collected last year uh on One Singular call funnel all right so I'm calling this 1.0 because and I'll kind of get into that uh about how more advanced versions and pieces of this uh this is all demo data so I don't necessar look at this but I'll go through each piece and go through kpis there's other videos on the Channel that I go through that no guru no oh yeah 9x all the time uh by any means so you want to stick around at least until we get to this portion because this is kind of the more advanced ninja stuff and then I'll talk about more automated ways and all that that this goes so first things first just going through what kpis are on here um so I marked pink for what is essentially an input and then a blue for what is a calculation okay so first thing you're going to have is leads apps bookings sales count of sales uh add cost new rev and then you're going to have from that you're going to have your row ads which is going to be your new rev to your ad cost your cost per lead your cost per app your cost per booking cost per sale your app to lead percentage so right how many apps came from the leads your bookings per app so how many bookings came from your apps and then your sales per booking right and then all these are going to have like breakdowns right sales per booking is just a blended number of all bookings and sales but like what goes into that is going to be show rate and reschedules and live but this is just like this is more or less a way for marketing and for for kind of like overall to see you're not going to use this for add attribution and tracking you're not going to do that into sheets like you can but it this just makes no sense and I'll get into softwares and like ways to do automations of this calls on day there's going to be how many calls were initially generated for the day okay so like if you had 10 calls come in that were booked today but were booked for tomorrow this would show 10 calls are on that day is when the call was booked for now again this is also why you kind of want automated or why you want Dynamic data going forward once you get to a certain scale because calls on day is going to change dramatically when people reschedule um when uh I mean mainly when people reschedule but when people reschedule when they double book when all that kind of stuff happens because this would be a standard and like stay as a single record which you don't want spots this is the Ninja part that I'll get into but is essentially how many open spots are available on that given day and then book percentage is a percentage of calls on day so uh divided by the total amount right so all right how you're going to get this information in here so there are people who do this manual and do it the day after I pref I don't like that and I always like live data and automated but there this is like again 1.0 way to do this over time you'll have all this in HubSpot and crms and all that kind of stuff but like even then I still run out of a sheet for the big Master now it's all live and updating and has way more information in it that's why I kind of don't want to show it because there's like customer data and stuff um but this is just the general like what you need in kpis to over like overall look and see what you need to do so for leads what you're going to do is you're going to have a tab here that's literally just going to be the date and the person's email I GPT and just or I didn't need GPT this but it did um so all you're going to have is the date that they opted in and their email okay because all you need to do is basically be able to count all right that will then count those that are in there for that given day apps exact same thing now the question becomes how much data and what else are you going to do with it because if you have a zap setup that says every time that these come in here you want to put this in here what else you get on that when that happens you get a lot more information you get their name you get like browser information you get all that so I'm a big fan of just all the data you can possibly get so but also being like functional and realistic so for what you're going to use this for the most you're probably going to want is like email name if you do phone number all that kind of stuff stuff because like over time you can batch them back and be like oh if they were a lead and an app and a booking do this that and all that again not something I'm like a super fan of just for this use case that exists but not in this so name and email is fine app same thing right so now you're going to do the same thing with applications so you're going to have the date that they came in all these are just Zapped in right so you just want a constant inflow of these coming in here and then these act as like a database like the simplest database in the world um but act as a database that you can then store and you can come back here and adjust these records but in current form if a zap's coming in they're pushing it in nothing's updating it someone changes their email doesn't get updated here right so you got to understand that this is not live in that way it's live in terms of inflow not in terms of updating okay then what else do you want to put in here you can do the same thing like you put name you can put all the application questions if you have hidden Fields you could do all of that in here but again for this use case and if this is our goal you don't need any of that information okay so that's apps bookings this is the first one you're going to have a little bit more on so this is going to be when someone book uh the date that someone clicked to book their email the sales rep they're signed to this was important for us for a really long time because we had another tab other than the summary that would do it by sales reps so you knew like how many sales reps had what and I can get into that in another one but another big one is the call date so someone today booked a call for tomorrow or someone today booked a call for today so this important you want this cuz you want to know not not how many units you sold today versus how many bookings you generated today you want to do how many sales you had today based on how many bookings were booked for today so a big difference there and again we learned all this just by doing it real time and like there's we have evolved 92 times over but like still to this day if we're just like split test and just or uh just like launch a new offer quick something like this is basically the setup we would still use because these are the only kpis you need and and it's 95% accurate 90% whatever that it'll get you there so booking sale for a sale you want the date of the purchase I do name and email on these cuz sometimes these are like a little bit more inform uh I want more information on this the type of purchase they did any data you put in here is going to allow you to query by it so if you want to know how many full pays your aovs on these versus this your aov across the whole thing uh uh the different type the count of different type like you can only do that if you have the data in here so full pays two pays and then the amount that they paid and then who the sales rep was again if you ever want to have a sheet over here a summary of Buy sales rep across range all that you would need the sales rep information here and you need the sales rep information here because then you because the only time a sales rep is assigned is booking and sale ads This Is How We Do It um still to this day uh where it's the day it is the total which is basically sum of the different traffic sources so like for us in this example and these are going just demo information but the traffic one would be Facebook so you just have Facebook up here this would be Google with brand search retarget right simple stuff like that for these numbers at least and then whatever Tik Tok or wherever else you're running LinkedIn ads and then spots I'll get into this one but spots well actually I'll just do this one now so ads back here this is either you do it the day after which we did for like three years every single morning after plug in the daily spend pop into the ad accounts and plug this in for prior day now we use use ad veronic and this automatically does that okay so this is I think free maybe it's like 100 bucks but I think it's it's free forever when we used it and this is very very um helpful it can be every 15 minutes or something like that can auto update pull to your ad accounts and then you can pick which ones it does of these and then it'll just stay automated so then over here real time throughout the day you have leads apps booking sales increasing and then you have your ad cost increasing as well and then ideally new rev and then all of this is relatively live flowing okay same thing with calls on day and then spots so for spots I got to figure out a way to get you guys this but what you need to do is you we have a master calendar call it sales at whatever company.com okay that calendar subscribes to all of your sales reps okay so when you click on that calendar on the little plus and Google Calendar wherever you guys use you can see everyone's calendar there you can click on on day and you can see everyone's across right and people share all the screenshots like oh we're full booked and all that it's like that now we hired somebody on upor cheap I don't even know 50 bucks 250 bucks somewhere in there to build us a Google script that will read that Google Calendar and is going to tell you the open spots available across those calendars uh 30 days in advance okay so what that looks like in like reality is that you'll have four sales reps and they'll be 50% booked okay the Google script is going to look across across what range so for us the hours are 8:00 a.m. to midnight Eastern so it's going to look from 8:00 a.m. to uh midnight Eastern and it's going to find all of the 30 minute because our calls are 30- minute blocks it's going to find all of the white space of 30 minutes and it's going to count that as one right throughout each person it's going to log that into a master sheet that is by that's auto updating every 15 minutes or 30 minutes across by their email sales rep email and then down by date and it's going to have this person has four availability so they have 2 hours right cuz 30 minutes uh this person has 12 availability so 6 hours this person is zero because they're on priority and they have no open spots it's going to rank them all and then over here on it's going to have a sum total of everyone across the day which is what marketing needs they don't care if one person's fully or the other's not or whatever but like just for marketing sake so this will tell you that you have six open spots available tomorrow basically meaning that the Google script went off is live updating and the Google script went off and found that there was whatever 3 hours of Open Spaces across the entire sales she that are available to book okay I got to figure out how to get you that too but it's it's not really that complicated but like I think we learned it from uh I'm forgetting his name right now but he does it with his Google Calendar to like count how he allocates his time and we're like oh we should build one of those so I'm hopefully there's a tool out there that does that by now but we still use the custom one so why that's important is because booked percentage is a target that we use for marketing so marketing constantly is trying to keep calendars 80% booked um again this is 90% accurate because calls on day is going to fluctuate and uh spots is basically going to read only into the future so if like things happen in the past it can't read that which it shouldn't but that's a back and forth thing and then spots and then you get book percentage all right notes big key here that we use you update an opt in you want to test a new email flow of something that is just overarching to the company or to the marketing more so of the company like just throw a note in here it's super super helpful like if I I have ours pulled up over here on the side but like a price increase uh we tested a short form booking page we turned splits on we ran 14 days we killed the splits all right so all of that is just important to track in here just cuz you want to over time be like why when you look back and you have months of this you're like we were steady humming at 56% or whatever uh app to booking or booking to app or whatever you want to call it right here and then it trended now it's at 40 and it's been at 40 like what changed over that time and then it just this makes it so you can make decisions is all this is about it's just literally being able to make better decisions all right so that's the gist of how to get all these in okay lead at booking sale ads spots okay these are all of your inflows now how do you do that zaps make whatever you want to use to do that a VA it doesn't matter I mean you want to do it automated because you want to be able to see this real time throughout the day and get kind of like okay cool right now I can see especially for this like we're targeting we're targeting hitting these numbers so I'm going to plug in some actual numbers now and just plug them into here and just overwrite these but you see the formulas they're simple it's like count these ones some anything that's multiples these are all formulas of what exists on this sheet right and then same thing counting summing because this one's a uh you want because it's one field and then same thing on sheet right very simple that's the whole point it's 1.0 tracker very very clean and simple now let me plug in some actual stuff I just picked a random day of uh August in 2024 so for us and I'm just going to overwrite these just so you can see I'll do this actually so here so we had 1,200 uh 1,200 leads we had 200 13 apps we had 102 bookings we spent $35,000 we had 23 new units we did 157 this is a special day so this actually it's probably bad cuz so we'll run twice a year specials that are internal or no it wasn't eight I don't know I actually cannot I can look back at this later but I believe that we R in a special that day and then call calls on day was 149 and open spots was 59 all right so again no guru no whatever I'm just telling you this was a day that we had on 81224 okay and then the day after we had a 2.7% row as and the day after we had a 1.8 and then a 3.8 and then a 1.6 and then a 5 and then a 4.9 then a 4.9 then a 1 .9 so like it bounces all over the board but like what you'll be able to do is get Trends and um and get averages across those all right so now that I'm using this this is actual data in here so this would be live pulling real time but now you can see so we spent 35 Grand that day to do 157 in new now how our sheets exist is a bunch of these versions of these tabs but for like sale for example we have the entire inflow of all money that comes into the company so this marketing piece of this is like this part of a sheet that's this big that is an entire cash flow statement for the entire company okay that has all expenses that come through QuickBooks that have all income that come through stripe so active uh low ticket like anything else would come in there as well so in our sale for example that sale tab ours is like all inflows of all money then we have a categorizing as what's new what's active what type uh what sales rep all of those things we have a refund tab that then pulls back like we have all that over time that's evolved that all just started with this because we make decisions based on this then track and also then make decisions on the overall cash flow of the company there and then of course we have QuickBooks and all that for like proper books and accounting um which even that is like we're tentative on if we should move off that because of how big we are now but like it's such a simple in andout flow um that it still makes sense for us but all to say this is a simple version okay so 35k spent uh to do 157 so we had $28 cost per lead which is actually interesting cuz like I look at this now I'm like all right our cost per lead right now on average is 18 18 bucks call it 1819 bucks and right now we're having a down period and like again no guru like we're having a down period right now where the sales are not backing out so marketing is like checking all the boxes and that would be a question of Okay cool so if we have 16 to 19 whatever dollar lead but they're not backing out is it just a quality issue like are we just is is how the new marketing is set up or how wherever pockets of traffic we're in is that just bad quality because it doesn't matter if your lead cost is $6 if no one buys like I'd rather have a $50 cost per lead and then as long as it backs out to what really matters is just cost per sale so out of this day $28 lead $164 application $343 booking and $1,500 unit okay so a 17% app to lead and at that range that's where we were that was very steadily there now our numbers are higher right now they're 20 to 25% uh lead to app and that is because we've rolled out V2 of application we changed up how it was we made less free form we did all that kind of stuff so we have a higher percent of that now um after to booking this is when we had uh uh a little bit less of a so one we had no routing so we had no Financial qualifier so we had no routing up or down so like this is basically giving everyone an opportunity who applies to book and then it was a little bit less friction in terms of like the text that was on page to get them to stop or whatever and sales per booking on day this is just raw all bookings that were booked for that day at one point um is 22% all right so calls on day 149 open spots 50 9 so we are 71 71% booked now this is even low because what we have the media buying team marketing overall optimized for is trying to get 80 so we just try and always stay at 80 you don't we don't want to go higher than that uh because I mean you do go higher than that but like you start to go too high and you're just burning money because there's nowhere for them to book two days in advance and that's a thing to monitor like over time because right here what this will actually look like is this um 5 z z z z so when this is actually built out it'll look like so what is this 200 so you have 150 spots then you'll have 180 spots then you'll have 90 spots 190 190 190 190 whatever rough numbers obviously is going to change day over Day based on sales team availability and all this so you're going to see on day you have this you're generating 100 bookings in a day that are starting to fill today as well as tomorrow and then how many available spots do you have tomorrow okay and what you're going to constantly have the media buying team is like Okay cool so like our Target is this 180 190 a day so if we have 180 and we want to fill 80% of that we need to Target 145 bookings so we just round up and say you want to generate 150 bookings our current cost per call is $340 so call it $34 45 so like in order to do that in this example and again those are just like thrown out there because if you look at this what we were actually booking was 150 right but uh in that model you'd be spending 50k a day in order to fill that so again this model is at some level hamster wheelie and like you constantly have to fill and you constantly have to be able to do that and this is still this is when we're operating even in current state until the end of this week with no Setters no low ticket no nothing just straight raw someone books in gets on a calendar try to sell them right so they're managing 150 bookings on day which this is this is legit number um these are actuals so there's 150 30 minute sales calls booked for that day um across at that time probably I don't even I don't even want to give a fake number but I think it was probably 20 something sales reps at that at that time we got up to like 30 um and since we have scaled down um because frankly we had a big like marketing style explosion we were filling calendars at like half and then we moved everyone to W2 and then we did all these changes then marketing started to refill and like basically where we're at now is cost per everything is dialed and but it's not backing out so it could be sales team Vibe it could be quality um but the quality is there we have Financial qualifiers now so you can see them um you and then the biggest thing is you have two sales reps that are performing extremely well and if you look and like they've seen lead flow so then it would go to tell you it's all just like how do you make decisions how much data do you have to make good decisions if you have two people with the same lead flow that are doing well and then you have the rest that aren't it's like Okay cool so it's like an overall skill and Vibe thing generally speaking um and or what else can we do which is just increase show rates from a tech perspective it's like increase show rates add more consumption try and do these things to get them higher quality uh and then on the media buying Facebook side it's like what can we do to like optimize better for the right type of person um and do that so yeah so that's the general gist um technically I can go like crazy in depth on how the 2.0 of this is basically having all of this data live within a live updating database that then you can query across and do formulas and do all stuff I personally hate HubSpot forms I are uh reporting I literally hate it um some people love it I just am not a fan I use this sometimes when I need to I think it's sheet go I think it's this one yeah I use one of these that is a tool for HubSpot database to push into sheets that's a real-time live updating and that is like Game Changer so I will take like the contact table inside HubSpot and have it live updating and only select the ones I Want For What I'm trying to track and what's important to a certain team or like deliverable or kpi and I'll push it to Sheets because it's so much better for me to do like formulas and across and like ranges and auto update than it is for me to do HubSpot reporting but over time you're going to want this in a live place that like you see your lead flow not in a sheet but you see it in your CRM and like but then how do you tie it back to ad cost so you need ad cost wherever that same location is the place so you can marry all this all this information uh we use looker studio uh for sales team for commissions for um coaching for like a couple these different pieces we haven't fully fledged into some pieces it's just like the important stuff and everything else I build in these still as long as the data is live updating somewhere this is just a viewer so it's like you can use whatever tool you want but if if I can fin angle this and change it and make it so we can make better decisions which is the whole point not for it to be sparkly and shiny it's like to drive Behavior to make better decisions and drive Behavior so for a sales team yes you want sparkly and live updating with you know fireworks and stuff when something happens and competition and all that for an operations thing I need accurate data to make better decisions doesn't need to you know motivate and and and like be sparkly um so yeah that's G just this I need uh comments on what else you guys want cuz I have like a ton of just random things that I'm just going to start going through and I just figured this one would be helpful based on yesterday's video talking about the math and I will be very interested to see like I said yesterday was very theoretical in terms of low ticket stuff I have some math on it the parts I don't have are like that Setter math and like I could have a 20% set rate instead of a 60 and all that so I'm excited to see how it plays out and then give you guys updates on what the actual math backed out to but this is going to be helpful if you don't have one of these and again Pro tip do it with the whole company it's the same methodology think systematically and you need all the money coming in and you need all the money coming out in there and then do it on day and then do it by category and then you can do cash flow statements you can do all the same stuff and I can go into those in future videos if that's of interest to people I just have to build them out cuz showing ours gives private information so that's what I got today sorry if it sound like this I'm sick but we keep going so talk soon
