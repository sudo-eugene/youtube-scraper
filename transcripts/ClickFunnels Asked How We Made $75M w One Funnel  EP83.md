# ClickFunnels Asked How We Made $75M w/ One Funnel | EP83
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FAgU9C-xrY

all right everybody Welcome back to another 
episode of ClickFunnels Radio I'm insanely excited   to introduce um a new friend of mine and somebody 
that I've seen a lot of their content on Twitter   on YouTube and they have been doing some amazing 
stuff It's called X now It's called X Oh yeah Yeah   Right So here we have Chris Cameron co-host and 
uh I guess the Jester now jester's privilege kind   of chiming in Granted no kidding Um but uh someone 
that's got uh incredible content greater backstory   a wealth of knowledge So without further ado let's 
go ahead and bring Ryan Clog on ClickFunnels Radio   Ryan thanks for coming on man Absolutely Yeah So 
go ahead Chris I I was going to say I kind of want   to start Here's the deal Okay You've got Warrior 
Babe but I want to I want to clear this up Yeah   You might be a warrior but you're clearly not a 
babe and you've never been through and probably   will never go through menopause However and you're 
definitely not a woman over 40 So why warrior babe   and what How did that happen And like how are 
you focusing on this Ryan Yeah So I am co-owner   not co-founder right So let's let's clear that up 
before any of this But I was essentially number   four or six somewhere in that range We can just 
meet in the middle and call five Uh on the team   and it was started by two co-founders One that's 
kind of more internet marketing e for a lack of   a better phrase Uh and then the other which is 
the co-founder brand face and she is the one who   has all the results had all the experience all of 
that So it's really a you know you call it expert   expert operator a lot of people call it now or 
like that offer publisher style thing Um built the   business with her and around her right uh across 
this whole thing So we're very paid driven and   really built her brand through this uh around 
this but she had insane results before Started   super you know light in terms of like getting 
inerson clients through paid advertising and   then moved into online uh full remote and then we 
have a whole transition we can go into or not but   uh the offers and the product stack had changed 
over time from everything from low ticket in   the very beginning to kind of your uh like hybrid 
info product to now full-on coaching So the actual   deliverable and to answer directly the deliverable 
is through coaches now that have mass amounts of   experience um in the space specifically for women 
for 40 to 60 year old women for that specific you   know use case and result This this is awesome 
man So many people do this do this attractive   character thing where one person does and a lot 
of times their uh their superpower may not be the   operations side right Um but they can be the face 
and they go out and do all this stuff and a lot   of times when you find somebody it's like a Batman 
Robin thing or something You have this face of the   company and then you have an operator So would 
you say you're kind of more on that integrator   operator side and kind of doing all that stuff 
Yeah 100% Leaned into that more so in the last six   months to a year uh in my specifics So basically 
the stack was like sales marketing product face   right it was kind of the initial right because in 
the beginning it's just sales and marketing right   there's not really oper there's nothing to operate 
um so it started a lot like that um and I cannot   give enough credit to them for both founding 
it like that zero to one it's not my skill set   I've never done it I've only done the one to end 
um and they have they crushed it with that and   then the co-founder brand face like she is the 
lifeblood the client wins channel is firing off   uh the methodology she's created the framing 
the brand all around that um that she's evolved   through through I think six or seven years now 
it's been um is just like unbelievable So as we   began to scale from cuz essentially I want to get 
into the offer stack because it's kind of changed   how then the roles moved but we did start with a 
lower ticket model Uh lady boss through you guys   right was like a big poster child at the time 
when we were doing this and we were you know   funnel right we were funnel hacking uh version 
of the uh of that right we were like kind of how   they did their offer stack but our piece was all 
more so around not general fat loss It was the get   toned It was the strong as the new sexy it was 
like this like you know more aggressive style   um which fit the the the personal right brand of 
that and yeah so we started as the low ticket and   then as we transitioned we moved into a call 
funnel with an info product that was $500 mind   you uh over the phone $500 which nobody tried 
that at it doesn't work now with the economics   um and then scaled that up to $1,1500 for 
lifetime access to this info product and   then basically we're stuck at a million a month 
and then we transitioned we left everything the   same on the marketing front and then moved it to 
uh just a different offer of coaching on the back   instead onetoone coaching and that was the jump 
to 3 million a month So same funnel stack same   acquisition just pitching something different 
which obviously changes some of the metrics   but the back end then backed out to there So I 
say that because as we scaled into these other   pockets us three kind of broke out into like our 
sweet spots and our skill sets So the uh initial   like internet marketing style co-founder um Luke 
he moved into sales marketing CEO like that's his   really strong suit He was spending for us up 
to 20K plus a day So like we didn't even need   to bring people into that marketing suite And 
then he and I were leading some version of sales   At one point she did but she led into brand face 
marketing assets fulfillment product like all of   that She's like the superstar of that And that's 
the client results side And then I leaned into all   the tech built all the tech systems ops like as 
that went And then more so way more ops than the   tech and systems and like infrastructure Dang dude 
Let's take one step back because that's insanely   impressive How did you get involved um not only 
with with your current company but let's just   start with the internet Why that Why operations Uh 
give us a sense to your you know business interest   Yeah Um went to ASU in my dorm for a year in class 
for a semester and uh kind of instantly knew that   wasn't going to be the the play and uh tried to 
do some like finance private equity stuff I didn't   really know what that was up until then Long story 
but over a year deal almost is right there falls   through bad partnership all this kind of stuff And 
I was like what is next And that was when I bought   my first internet marketing thing for $497 through 
a webinar funnel um that I now know but didn't at   the time And it was all about um will not mention 
uh but it was all about Instagram shoutouts   essentially So his Instagram shoutouts because 
I think he's off I think he's off the radar now   and I don't want to dox him but uh it's what was 
all about Instagram shoutouts You're basically   creating a graphic contacting all these Instagram 
pages putting it on there and doing a link in bio   you're sending them to an opt-in page and then the 
goal was that you actually set the thank you page   as a redirect to a ClickBank offer to liquidate So 
right so you're paying 300 bucks over here you're   getting whatever 500 leads a thousand leads and 
then those are directly getting redirected after   to a niche you know let's call it women's fitness 
because we're there And then they watch some   ClickBank thing and you make two 300 bucks a day 
and it liquidates and then you're just supposed   to mail the list and monetize And real quick I 
learned after getting 20,000 email subscribers   in like two weeks doing this and breaking even 
that I literally couldn't afford the email hosting   bill for AWeber And I didn't know how I didn't 
want to you know fake email from somebody Like   the whole model was just relying on me doing the 
this part and I just couldn't do it and didn't   have the wherewithal to understand I could pay 
someone to email the list and take a percent and   like do all that So that was the initial chops 
which then led me into Clickfunnels which then   led me into ecom stuff like doing all the things 
I was doing everything you can imagine on like   make money online vibe of courses and education 
and lead genen and affiliate and this stuff and   I'd get everything up to a couple grand a day 
and an ad account would go down or I'd explode   over here or my interest would go over here like 
any of them would have worked All the courses were   good I was me who was not leaning into that and 
I will say that till the day I die is like all   these courses if someone can do it or someone has 
done it you can do it like 100% and I just didn't   So I was fumbling around um a ton and then uh 
ended up buying a consulting.com So Sam Evans   course the middle tier and then again without 
having the wherewithal to see beyond right here   uh realized I didn't want to be the expert 
consultant What did I know Who was I to do   that And it's just not really my scene to be like 
you know until recent like literally you know two   months ago to like share anything or be public Um 
I really quick realized that I just wasn't going   to do what was in the course And so I was just in 
the community I learned all the stuff and it was   all about doing exactly the business model we now 
run And I met somebody in the group that posted   in the community And that ended up being Luke Got 
on a call with him Started doing some sales page   random builds making a thousand bucks every six 
weeks And you know next thing you know five years   later we're here So at what point did they want 
to bring you on full-time Like these funnels these   pages you're building are crushing Um hopefully 
you're building ClickFunnels If not get your free   trial clickfunnels.com Everyone listening Just 
kidding But uh what was that process like Yeah it   was uh at that time it was long form two-step uh 
on page So I was like learning I knew a little bit   of stuff around uh CF Pro Tools was kind of newer 
but we were using some functions out of that and   like shout out Jamie Yeah Yeah Right And making it 
so you know we could capture optin information on   a on a three-step Basically we're trying to funnel 
hack everybody who does it Um so I was building   those and at the time it was more so you know we 
were just so shortsighted There was no ascension   to it which is the whole point of doing it right 
something like that low ticket we had an Otto that   was lifetime access that kind of that like it 
did liquidate it was making some money but we   didn't know our numbers on retention and churn 
and LTV you know in comparison to C like we just   didn't know any of that so yeah I was basically 
building those and Luke called me one day and was   like yeah like how do we take this thing to 10 
million and I was like let's just do a callunnel   like it was right when co had started and we were 
like let's just let's just do a call funnel and   we had this course that they had already made and 
had sold whatever a hundred units of maybe that   was this basically ovens model thing So it's your 
large Kajjabi portal your group coaching and your   community and it was like not really fleshed out 
but like it had all of the pieces and parts and   all the course content already built like let's 
just sell it over the phone so we can control the   economics So that was when so at that point Luke 
was like all right cool like ownership let's do   this let's break it out and that's evolved over 
time So you talk about this book a call thing   Um and then you also said that it doesn't work 
anymore because the economics So this was a $500   thing Is that the one that you're referring to 
Yeah Yeah Because I mean think about it If you   have a $200 cost per call which is like Totally 
Yeah Right It's you that's not that's before   showed call 50% of your calls are going to show 
rough numbers So now you have a $400 live call   Do the math on how you're going to make more than 
500 And that's before overhead That's before right   That or sales commissions Your sales commission 
alone plus that is your you're losing money Do   you guys still run that model at all just at a 
higher price point Yes we did 72 million directly   through a call funnel Same way Okay so I want 
to know I want to know like the steps of that   call funnel I'd love to hear like pricing Are you 
sending them to like a VSSL Are you sending them   to like a webinar first that's booked a call What 
is the process Yeah So we've never done webinars   We've never done pre-recorded in that way where 
it's like you know a git whatever or JIT like   we've never done any of those directly Um we 
did actually that's not true We tried it way   back before we started the call funnel and just 
turned it off Um but no the funnel ended up so   at that time we had bought the consulting.com 
program I had bought Becker's program that he   had at the time which was iron mastermind and we 
bought salesprocess.io So I bought like $15,000   worth of courses locked myself in an Airbnb and we 
built it like over a weekend And it is opt-in page   uh which is your class Dude Ryan you are the 
epitome by the way of marketing nerd When I see   you light up it's like let's talk numbers let's 
talk conversion This is everyone be taking notes   Yeah Yeah Yeah No And again the important part of 
what you said at the beginning is like you know   the 46-y old women and the client wins and like it 
fuels this whole machine Yeah But I'm I'm a huge   fan of taking the internet marketing principles 
and applying them to something that's not towards   other marketers Um I think there's a place for it 
for sure and there's you know 50 people in a room   and they all want people to teach coaches how to 
coach people on coaching No you know you know I   don't and there guess what There are people who 
crush it at this and like the top top kingpin   people And I also think there is a lane for it for 
the guy who's the best at webinars and the best at   SMS and the best at this selling to each other 
But when it gets a little more broad stroke at   just like how to be the best at like acquisition 
and then like then they're all selling that But   that's separate point But yeah so the funnel 
itself is opt-in page It's your very it's your   classic It is your headline image right We've 
tested a few variations We basically stuck on   the same with the popup name email We do not do 
phone number Uh we do not do phone number because   at the time and still to this day we don't have 
the capacity to use the phone numbers well enough   to justify the decrease Right Because you're going 
to get 30% less optins with a phone number You can   wiggle that and optional and whatever but just 
call it that Hey I'm looking at this right now   and I notice you've got the quick video and it's 
vertical Usually you know you'd have like a sales   page like this and it's going to be you know 
the landscape Is there a reason that you used   vertical here Is that to match up with just like 
and everything else Yeah So it depends which one   you're on but yeah So there's a large swath of 
what you're looking at So the at the time it was   a VSSL opt-in funnel up until two three months ago 
and all 72 million were through that And it was an   opt-in page name email go to a VSSL Over X amount 
of time we rolled out what you're talking about   which is a vertical versus a horizontal Vertical 
is only supposed to play on mobile but depending   on what you're looking at some haven't been edited 
for the newer stuff you're looking at Uh they're   going to watch that and there's going no CTA is 
huge So no CTA on that at all Force consumption   Uh you're going to have a massive amount of drop 
off and that's okay because you get their email   right So we remarket heavy Um they will then be 
able to apply They fill out an application We've   on you know on variation 16 of the application Um 
and then they go from the app to uh book a call   They book a call and they talk to a sales rep and 
they talk to a sales rep and you know one slash   two if it's a follow-up call close And that's Okay 
Before we go further before we go further though   you said version 16 All right Yes So this is all 
data driven You What are some of the key things   that made you say "Okay we're going on to the next 
version." And then how did you kind of know which   was performing better and say "All right now 
we're going to do this version." Yeah So we tie   everything So the difficulty with something 
like this versus you know just looking at   your ClickFunnel stats page is on page conversion 
percentage does not map to revenue per XYZ action   Thank you Yes Yeah Correct So you need backend no 
matter what So I don't know how we don't do it in   ClickFunnels at this scale because where we're 
at So we use HubSpot for our CRM but you need   somewhere that stores all of that data because for 
example let's use something extreme just because   it's easier to think of two opt-in pages and one 
promises a free cruise and one promises a you know   get toned and it's going to be the hardest thing 
of your entire existence One's going to get a 2%   opt-in rate and one's going to get you know an 
80% opt-in rate Doesn't mean they're spending   money Yeah But the one that on the back end that's 
actually going to convert into your product that   has congruency that is coming in with the right 
framing is going to be a higher revenue per lead   or per whatever action matter call then you 
then yes So there's a lot of different numbers   It's the rev it's cash collected It's net It's 
Yeah So it's not as simple as saying this video   outperformed There's a lot of other pieces that 
No It could have one could have a 50% engagement   rate One could have a 20% engagement rate But if 
the 20% one says oh this is expensive and you're   going to have to work for this and it's going to 
be like it's application only and the other one   says "Oh it's a free breezy ride and just apply 
Everyone gets into it and it's $12." One's going   to have a higher click-through higher app higher 
booking but they're not going to convert Yeah This   is kind of the This is kind of like popcorn at 
the movie theater idea I don't know It's not a   direct correlation but like which would actually 
sell more Like revenue-wise Yeah We're going to   sell a lot lot more popcorn at five bucks than 10 
bucks but what's the actual revenue at the end of   the day Yeah And when you only have one offer uh 
in in that example uh it's much more difficult   right because like you can't you can't even swing 
it by volume right It's it's literally just do   they close It's a unit game And then obviously 
cash per unit but we have those numbers Those are   different Let's let's get nerdy Let's get nerdy 
Too late We already did bro Yeah Yeah that's also   true We're going to continue to get nerdy Um one 
of my favorite sayings especially in this game is   just the path is math right There's so much that 
it's actually not too difficult to make the right   data driven decision when your foundation is set 
in the proper way I really feel like everything   you've done professionally has accomplished that 
perfectly What did you do Cuz it kind of seems   like maybe you came into this business and they 
weren't as dialed in as they should have been I'm   not trying to generalize but just based on this 
conversation and you came in and really tightened   the screws You mentioned like CAC to LTV looking 
at you know fullfunnel conversion rates What tell   us that process like what did you do to start to 
figure out those numbers Yeah that this is a full   evolution of all three of us throughout this that 
Luke is light years ahead of me in everything and   you know in all these other in all these ways Uh 
she is light years ahead of me in all these ways   and I have you know my little pocket of skill set 
that has been evolved through doing this Let's be   very clear this was not a I came into it and was 
like "Oh what's your LTV to CAC ratios and what is   this and that?" Like this has been an evolution 
over years and like learnings from doing and   also continuing to buy courses continuing to 
mass consume content like that So yeah I did   not know any of this coming into this I mean I 
literally applied basically to work with Luke to   learn everything about sales marketing funnels and 
whatever and knew my the smidg of it But like you   know I learned pretty quick and learned that and 
then we're all in newfound Like we we joke that   everyone at the company up until recent every 
time we do a record month it's everyone's PR   Like there's not someone coming in with experience 
that's like "Oh let me apply this system and model   of somewhere else." Which has been a shortcoming 
right over time because you know we maybe hit   these levels and it's like we don't know how to 
go past it Yeah It's real sales We don't know how   like you know and you try and model it off someone 
from YouTube or some course or something and you   get you know up to that level maybe or kind of 
spin it your own way or apply it yourself Um and   only as of recent so like when we did went from 
one to three we brought in a sales manager that   had done three before in his pod He was a top pod 
leader at another info coaching company that was   at like 12 million a month I think at the time 
or not Actually that's not true They're at sub   10 Now they're at like 12 to 15 But uh he had run 
their pod their highest performing pod came in we   switched the offers we added you know finally we 
added all this stuff and he put in you know the   energy and the time and the development and all 
this stuff to the people and we went from one to   three right over over that year And that was last 
year going from last year we did whatever 11 or 12   or two ago and then last year 2024 we did 30 and 
that jumped So we 3xed year-over-year Big jump   Everything broke right So it's like everything 
that could break broke and uh yeah So all to say   that like we learned this stuff during it and 
now yeah this is much more my pocket and I have   learned the numbers back and forth and everything 
down to margin if you're selling an info versus   coaching versus what and the sales reps making 
comms on 30-day versus full contract value and   cash collection like blah blah blah But like yeah 
I didn't know any of this So I learned all of this   by doing it in it and every month is my PR too So 
definitely some shortsightedness and comingings   of that Um but now our new cso has gone you know 
done over hundred uh a year in phone sales which   is fantastic So our 8 to 10 million a month 
he's done before Um our outbound director has   done three and a half million I believe in setter 
before Our CMO has sold over 100,000 load tickets   through one funnel So like we're stacking the 
team now and it's on you know seuite or whatever   you want to call it And yeah they've already done 
PRs outside of us and now it's like hey let's just   implement what we've done Yeah that's a tough one 
because a lot of times you're looking at you know   you're learning and you kind of cap out and go to 
try to find somebody who's done more is difficult   right to bring them in and like you know if 
you're going to have a software that you want   to do 500 million a year in probably good to have 
an operator that's done that somewhere before Yeah   that's a great example of like the software side 
or like the tech side It's like we don't know Like   we joke that sometimes it is like enough duct tape 
wrapped around it like it's not going to break But   is that the most efficient way to balance to 
balance a jet on the other end of it and it's   like no it's not So like we just hired a company 
to come in and we're restructuring all of our data   from like a toz source of truth everything that's 
done it for hundred million dollar you know info   coaching That's not cheap It's not terrible but 
it's not cheap Yeah Yeah Yeah Not terrible but   not cheap Yeah I got you in an add moment I almost 
want to go back to this funnel though because I   think I cut you off I was talking about Yeah Okay 
So you do this Yeah You do this apply thing right   And then they go to a call You just mentioned 
setters and closers too How does this go How do   you figure that out after they're kind of clicking 
apply now Yeah So for 71 or two million up until   eight weeks ago we had no setters whatsoever So 
we did went straight to a closer like an hourong   call or what 30 minute phone slot However many 
hundreds of calls a day let's just say every day   for years Uh for you got some sales warriors Yeah 
No it's a for us it was always a volume game It   was much more around there to make the math work 
than it was around the crazy kind of like internet   marketing sales stuff you hear of where it's all 
that and all to say that's not necessarily the   correct way to do it uh or the best way to do it 
because we could have squeezed more We could have   maybe you know done this stuff So we're in lie of 
changes right now on how we maybe expand those Um   about two years ago we moved everyone to Zoom So 
it was phone calls before that Um and then yeah   the office stack has changed throughout So now 
everyone's on Zoom uh oneto ones But then what's   what's the benefit there Just that they're seeing 
they're seeing the people talking or the fact   that it's in like a calendar invite that reminds 
them why Zoom more effective Yeah both But I mean   our demo right 4060 it there is a bit of a tech 
issue sometimes with the Zoom So like phone's a   good backup Um but yeah you can just control the 
narrative a lot better It's like you know you and   I looking at looking at each other here There's 
also cons right It's like if you have a messy   background if you show up disheveled if there's 
whatever uh if you aren't confident in your thing   it's hard to pitch and and if you're not confident 
But there's a lot of pro it's a magnifying glass   simply put right So it's like Yeah And then now we 
have a deck So now we actually have like a like a   like a pitch thing we walk through um that kind 
of highlights some important key aspects We can   show before and after We can you know we can show 
the different stuff on call Uh that makes it a lot   better as well But that that's two weeks old Okay 
cool So on this call you know you have people who   are good salespeople some people who are learning 
but with the deck I think now you're having just   people follow a script that makes more sense but 
is there is there a discovery Like what is what   is this script of this call Give us kind of an 
idea of what that 30 minutes breaks down Yeah I   mean I'm I'm gently getting out of my realm here 
so I wanted that to be known This isn't 100% my   speed but they just rolled out a new script and 
of course yes discovery Um but initially a big   thing right with the time aotment is setting the 
frame setting the tone we don't have time to go   and bounce around and go and narrate hopefully the 
application gets that background Yeah application   gets a lot of background that then you can 
prod into and you know why why can't you   do this on your own or why haven't you been able 
to and you know the classic bridge the gap right   u for sure and the beauty of what we do too and 
what we're selling is the personalization aspect   so it's not we're not pitching you know you're 
pitching yes one thing but within that thing   has personalization beyond belief So there are 
different people that come in different phases   of like you said menopause There's different 
age brackets There's different current body   types There's different desired body types You 
blend those all together and there's you know   27 tracks you could go on uh when you multiply 
that out So it's like but all of them can tailor   to that through this offering uh which works out 
really well So yeah it's essentially doing that   um through the deck and then also highlighting uh 
you know client wins our process how we look at   this all of that quick video application funnel go 
to a call what's the price point And and obviously   if you have a number of different things that 
that your sales rep can now say okay this fits   you best Are they all at different price points 
Kind of choose your own adventure or what Nope   All the same So right now it's around seven grand 
um for like a PIFF Um but there's payment plans   internal We have external as well that we do use 
kind of Um but yeah it's around that price Then   we have the internal pay plans you know equal out 
to more because you have the cash collection risk   But yeah we've danced around I mean it's gone 
from five it's gone to six it's gone to seven   Uh you know we have people in our space Um I don't 
really like you know competitors We're all doing   the same thing We're all helping the same audience 
Sometimes there's a little bit of overlap but like   there's ones that are 10 and 30k in our space 
Um and and higher I know that So yeah it just   depends on the offering Um so where we're at with 
ours is that you went from five to six to seven   Is that because you're like "Wait shoot We're 
selling a ton of these at five Let's try six."   And then you pay attention to the data Yeah where 
the market went and then also like I mass consume   hormone information and understanding where a 
coach will sit on roster and how much they can   make and have it very competitive for them and all 
that and then having that as a function of margin   So it's like if they're going to make whatever 20% 
of the thing it's like we need to divide that out   and see where we can land that fits market you 
know you're Dan you're you're rocking hard place   a little bit But I hope people are understanding 
like what they're hearing though Ben Like a simple   video application phonefunnel 70 plus million 
I mean no setters volume like yes it's it's in   this in that example it's very much so like an 
acquisition company right It's it's not direct I   mean it's like direct response kind of but like it 
has those principles but it is a little bit more   evergreen Another thing we didn't super go into 
So we have a large organic engine that exists that   only services middle and bottom of funnel So and 
not necessarily by design Let me make that also   clear like it is it would be amazing if we had 
first click that was coming from there and we had   organic flow and you talked to all these [ __ ] 
guys and you know a lot of the Clickfunnels guys   too that you know can make a couple hundred grand 
a month just strictly from their organic audience   Um that has not been the case historically for us 
It is extremely uh paid mediadriven Um you know   90 whatever percent of it is firstclick paid and 
then once they're in the ecosystem once you drop   them in there and x amount percent uh x percentage 
of them apply they go into the email flows We send   10 emails a day We point them back to the website 
and there's a content web for days You could watch   content around every specific piece and there's 
podcasts and there's videos and there's long form   blog There's like everything Um so that's been 
a really big thing for us Uh because when you're   running that kind of volume and what you're doing 
you know you're saying callunnel the big thing   around call funnels in my opinion and we can 
go to the other funnels we're running now too   because I think that'll be helpful Um it's all 
about consumption because you're going from ice   cold lead to you know within 48 hours getting 
pitched 7K 10K 15K And that's why the organic   ones have such good numbers because they have that 
trust and they have that consumption prior So when   you're going through paid it's it's a different 
ballgame I hate this saying Ryan but it's true   because the fortune is in the followup probably 
because it's just too cliche at this point But   when you say content centered around middle of 
funnel and bottle bottom of funnel basically how   I describe this to beginners sometimes is right 
when you're top of funnel it's problem product or   sorry problem solution product right Would you say 
your content strategy drives around that a little   bit as well So a lot of YouTube content podcast 
etc isn't really around the problem but more   solution based because it's built for middle and 
bottom of funnel Yes Solution solution and also   like keyword right So think uh think the very 
top of funnel being like lose weight right And   then think middle of funnel using specifics around 
you know strength training using specifics around   micro macronutrients like stuff like that that's 
kind of more in-depth or more like unless you know   you don't know right type of stuff Um so there 
is a pocket that has existed that is a little bit   more general and we're starting up the content 
engine this week of like let's do some correct   packaging and let's try and do some kind of mass 
amounts of potential organic first click uh which   would be amazing for us But yeah a majority of 
it has existed in there and then also there's a   ton of content that's around customer reviews and 
customer long form testimonials because we look at   it like essentially the the tranches of reviews 
are you're going to get your Facebook messages   inside your group You're going to get your 
comments You're going to get your uh chats with   coaches whatever is textbased That's like the most 
volume you're going to get The next is going to be   your pictures like your before and afters your 
progress photos stuff like that which is going   to be lesser but more impactful The next layer is 
going to get them all doing a standardized like   selfie video review that can be used And then the 
bottom and the least but the most impactful in my   opinion is the long form customer interviews So 
we have a ton of content that exists like that   on site and on YouTube that is long form 30 to 
50 minutes of uh you know Nikki brand face and   company lead doing customer interviews with one 
two three-year customers of the product which   acted really really good as middle and bottom 
funnel but would never be something that is a cold   top offunnel thing They're not going to Yeah Yeah 
Right All right So last thing around at least that   I have around follow-up You've mentioned a piece 
of this organic content is email as well right   This is lead capturing How much of a autoresponder 
are your leads put in to still book a call How   long does that last Yeah maybe they didn't Yeah 
we're sending five to 10 10 million emails a month   at this point Uh so let's So as an individual 
so someone comes in and they opt in but they   don't apply So we the flows are essentially for 
the VSSL funnel is going to be your opt no apply   your apply no book your book no show and then 
your you know closed basically right you're going   to have those simple buckets so they're going 
to get the most contextual follow-up possible   uh golden nugget win is in order to get those 
first opens and those clicks you're going to   fire off that they're getting that training which 
is very common but in our VSSLs a lot of the old   ones we're testing some stuff without this now 
so don't tell me I'm not doing it now when you   funnel hack me um but we will do you know stay 
until the end and get these bonuses and in doing   that we then deliver it via email So that gets 
really good opens and clicks and all that and then   on that you're sending them back to a page that's 
the VSSL testimonial wall Your bonuses are at the   bottom and they scroll all the way to the bottom 
to get the bonuses that are info products that   are calculators that are PDFs that are whatever Um 
so that's that initial flow is your opt So you're   going to get all those contextual someone's going 
to apply but not book call it 50% of those people   There are people out there that embed the widget 
and say they get 100% which obvious um because you   can't com you can't complete the form without the 
booking Um but the app no books are hot for us and   that's where we get phone number for the first 
time So you can do email follow-up you can do   text follow-up you can introduce setters you can 
do whatever and then the next is going to be that   no-show basically no-show reschedule pipeline and 
then closed with that That's your automations Now   your blasts or your campaigns or whatever you 
call them in your software we're sending two a   day every day forever Two a day Two a day Every 
day That's what middlefunnel content primarily   Yeah That's Oh hey check out this video Oh hey do 
this Oh here's a link to a free product Here's an   asset Here's a free resource Chris we got to relay 
that Two emails a day Every day Yeah Two Two a day   I mean obviously you figured out that you're not 
getting a lot of unsubscribes or you'd go down to   one or something So is that what you're tracking 
Why two a day I watched a video way back when and   this is the marketing team right Again I kind of 
sit over here now and like I'm giving opinions   on this or kind of like what we've done but not 
what I'm doing I'm not writing the emails every   day and you know analyzing the data down to the 
nth degree but uh someone's on your email list   because they want to be on your email list right 
They are for a reason And the ones who don't want   to you'd rather them unsubscribe and be off that 
anyway than you would not right So like you want   to give them the value You don't want to hammer 
them with CTAs You don't want to say like apply   apply like you know just hammer them with that But 
if you're leading with value first and it's framed   in a good way that's actually good information and 
stuff they can consume They can learn stuff they   can whatever like no problem with it Um no problem 
with it when you're hammering them with CTA every   day as one of the two emails Like no that doesn't 
work or make sense I mean I'm sure it does work   for some things but you're just aggressively 
cleaning your list and getting rid of the people   that maybe could convert after x amount of touch 
points in my opinion Um yeah there's a lot of ways   to do this and there's a lot of pros on this 
portion of it Um but yeah our copyriter it's   two a day That's crazy nurture too My gosh crazy 
nurture How often are you dropping in CTAs then Uh   well it's all buried in the content too So once 
you content everything on site has sticky here   sticky here like all these different directions So 
I mean it's already all pushes there and then that   apply pushes to the center to the middle of funnel 
of the other funnel of like the core funnel right   So like your apply page brings them back into flow 
in the middle Um which is extremely helpful right   for all your tracking needs Uh because then you 
get all your sources and they all end up going   into one place but you have your path tracking 
So what content works what emails work That's   why we kind of like brief touched on it but it's 
very very important once you start to get to a   certain size and scale that you're storing all 
of this in one place Uh you can use close you   can use HubSpot you can use I'm sure ClickFunnels 
has some variation of it with all the touch points   you know not super privy Uh I'm on 1.0 to make 
it known Um but uh yeah I mean you need somewhere   that you can see when you're doing something 
that's not direct to cardart because if you can't   see that then you don't know what is impactful 
You don't know what touch points existed Uh we   use Hyros for that piece of it for the journey 
We actually don't use Hyros for the pixel side   of things which is funny enough Uh we do that 
custom but we use them for the journey because   it's best out of the box that you can find where 
they went what content pieces what categories of   content all that Gotcha Fascinating I know Um what 
other funnels we diving into I know we mentioned   VSSL funnels You had a couple talked about the 
other ones We have three right now Yeah Yeah So   this is the this is the whole like what you know 
popped off or whatever on YouTube and cuz walking   through these So the three the three offers that 
we went through were a low ticket that was like   essentially like a recurring monthly app that had 
uh Otto that was lifetime access So call it $27   with like a trial and then it was $150 I think at 
the time $147 for lifetime access Idea being that   you more than liquidated and that you made all 
your money on the recurring Okay that was like   initial goal Math wasn't math thing We didn't 
have more ascension rungs We didn't even know   that was a thing at that time Uh it just we just 
weren't privy Next was this info funnel and we   were selling an info product through a VSSL opt-in 
funnel which is the one I just described We got up   to a million a month just doing that strictly 
through volume right We were doing 10 to 12   million bucks a year all day doing that The next 
iteration was that exact same VSSL opt-in funnel   and that's what we did 30 million with last year 
and everything exploded The acquisition exploded   in Q3 into Q4 on the ad side and then how that 
then filled calendars because the other game here   is direct to cart versus uh callfunnel You have 
availability you need to constantly be threading   that needle on how booked the uh calendars are for 
10 sales reps or 50 sales reps Where we broke was   this what you're saying is the other funnels and 
the acquisition We didn't have anything teed up We   likely pushed it too far We went too hard on that 
one funnel and for too long of an amount of time   and we didn't differentiate We brought in a new 
CMO into this new thing We had talked about low   ticket We had talked about these other type of 
funnels and we had never done anything about it   and that is why we got caught holding and it was 
bad uh CPA's rising trying to get marketing guys   in that's not working because it was around the 
actual structure and what we were using for the   funnels as much as it was around the actual media 
buying and the creative okay so the three funnels   we run now VSSL optin funnel that one still runs 
same core one okay still gets a majority of the   piece of that that comes through there we have 
another VSSL opt-in funnel that's the same funnel   structure but has a different VSSL I'm going 
to come back to this because it's going to be   funny the next one we're running is a DTA funnel 
is what we're calling Some call it a direct to   VSSL I don't know what you guys call it over at 
ClickFunnels but it's going to be your classic   headline VSSL apply button So you're skipping the 
optin Okay with that you lose consumption You get   rid of friction We actually have a different app 
on there because we need to qualify them harder   and then it goes straight to booking So your cost 
per call your cost per app whatever is going to be   way lower generally speaking uh because they can 
go right through it There are different ways to   do that where the button on there that applies 
either wait it waits until the CTA it waits x   amount of minutes you can do stuff with your VSSL 
on Vidalytics or whatever the Omni whatever one   is to make it so you get opt-in information we 
don't do any of that right now but that one runs   um and gets a very good cost per call and very 
per uh good cost per app and cost per call but   the issue is the consumption isn't there as 
much You can only hammer them so much between   the time that they apply or book and before they 
get on a phone call So you have lower show rates   and you have lower close rates because of the 
consumption because of the friction There are   ways to nail this There's ways to delay the CTA 
for five minutes and achieve a similar amount of   consumption Never going to be as much as someone 
who opted in and got nine emails and watched this   and then went over here and then applied Uh or was 
forced to wait until 22 minutes through the VSSL   to apply Um but yeah so it's just a different game 
of consumption versus cost It's like this this   economics model of cost versus consumption And 
then the most recent uh and the one that's doing   really well for us is the low ticket ascension So 
we will sell a low ticket product sub50 bucks Um   and the entire goal of that is ascension into the 
back end not AOV and not uh liquidation I mean yes   at some level obviously you want to drive it as 
high as possible to try and aim for liquidation Um   but it is not front-end profitable and the goal is 
not to be So quick math on that Let's say it costs   you $100 to sell something that's $50 Okay so your 
net AOV or I'm sorry your net CPA is $50 right The   spread between those you lost $50 for everyone you 
purchased So for us the thank you page is book a   quick start call book an implementation call 
whatever you want to call it and they book in   a call with a setter They talk to a setter for 
15 minutes and then they get set with a closer   and then the closer closes them So two call close 
but it is same back end back end Yes low ticket   products are different right low ticket products 
are little pieces little you know info around this   We're super super cognizant of like brand So we 
are not the people who just throw up a PDF and   sell it or do this or that Like so we build out 
full you know info products essentially for these   Um that's why it almost takes us kind of longer 
to launch stuff like this Um so but if your math   is that and you have $50 AOV I'm sorry yeah $50 
net CPA and then it's all about ascension rate So   it's knowing those two numbers If 5% of the people 
ascend you have a $1,000 CPA on your backend thing   F $50 divided by 5% ascension thousand bucks right 
Yeah So that's the game we're playing now Now   the issue with that keeping the net CPA in pocket 
knowing that only 5% do it If you want to sell 20   units a day you have to sell whatever 400 units on 
the front every day which as I'm sure we all know   is difficult to keep within pocket within CPA And 
then you deal with the availability issue the same   way you deal with it on a VSSL optin funnel You 
have to navigate a setter availability calendar   and you have to navigate a closer availability 
cander You have to navigate show rates on a set   call Not to mention not to mention their calendar 
but what they're available to do not to mention   which is and then you can't you can't bump those 
out more than 48 maybe 72 hours or you leave rates   like no other right So it's how tight can you get 
that window to where your ascension happens within   5 days And you're going to get people that are 30 
days later you're going to get those which just   drive that percentage up But like if you're 
looking on day or across you know seven-day   windows that's the game I think it's the best 
one Yeah Have you seen though like a bump with   the setter thing I've always had a hard time with 
that Just me personally Like if you've got them on   the call get them freaking closed Like if you're 
going to say now we have another opportunity for   them to miss a call or to cool off at all Have 
you tested this and you think the setter thing is   working well Yeah So we tested Yes Very well Very 
very well It's the it's the hottest pocket for   setters on show and close rate Wow Setters exist 
in three buckets right now for us They exist as   auto set which is what we're going to call these 
So they get auto bookings on their calendar and   they convert them into closed call sets They get 
self sets which is going to be your classic like   app no books ring the CRM do all those things and 
then they're going to get confirm sets They're   actually confirming all the ad bookings and all 
the marketing bookings So they'll dial them within   1 three five minutes max five uh once they book a 
call and then didn't come from a set and they'll   confirm with them you know it's this time zone 
You know it's a Zoom call Here's what we're going   to cover I saw you put this in your app Is that 
correct Like that kind of stuff The quick start   call is the most interesting because someone is 
now coming in with the framing That's the issue is   the framing because if you send that straight to a 
closer calendar they're going backtoback on people   who booked in who watched the VSSL that knew this 
was a program they were applying for and doing   this You then your next call is coming from low 
ticket ascension and the framing was here's your   quick start Yeah Your quick start implementation 
on this There's no edification There's no you know   they're basically thinking they're getting out 
with a CS rep without you know titling it as that   They think they're getting out with someone to 
help them with that which in all fairness they   are when they talk to a setter right It's oh 
did you get your access Okay here's what you   got Cool Yes And then a very quick transition to 
okay and why didn't you apply for the coaching   And it's like oh what coaching right I just saw 
an ad because you're spending 30 grand a day or   whatever Like or you know these guys there's other 
people in the space you know spending hundreds of   thousands of dollars a day to low ticket And 
it's like why did why did you not apply for   coaching All the results you see on the website 
come from coaching You're going to get all this   personalization You're going to get this And then 
set them with the closer So those the sets from   that have the highest show rate and the highest 
close rate of anything in the company Wow that's   pretty awesome man I do I think over the next 18 
months that low ticket funnel is going to be the   most profitable That's my prediction live on 
ClickFunnels radio We'll see The big thing for   us and it's so funny but we talking about what 
you said earlier of you know problem solution   product right Like this product exists kind of 
like in that middle It's not it's not built in   a way that is sell 500 units of it a day which 
is a ceiling that we can hit of is it 50 is it   150 is it 300 units you can sell a day remaining 
in there and more so thus far for us has acted as   almost like a retargeting asset because we have 
so many emails and so many things So you'll get   buyers and they're already in our system from four 
years ago or a year ago or a month ago Um which   is great and the math works and like they're just 
coming back into the funnel and now they're going   through the proper funnel to get on the right call 
and do that with the right framing but it is not   something you can mass sell a thousand units of 
a day because of how it's framed and what the   product is More so about how what it or how it's 
framed than what it is is currently more kind of   the in the weeds example right It's like the oh 
specific this weight training or the specific this   thing that is not somebody who's mass market who 
doesn't know anything about this yet it exists for   someone that kind of has some awareness So that's 
with the rebuild So that's where we're going with   this on how we build this So that funnel style can 
work for us at mass scale Yeah you could just test   other frontends too right To even worry about like 
like the different like you mentioned whatever   unit plateaus you feel like you're going to hit 
just opening up so there's different pieces of a   pie to where they're scratching different niches 
and all kind you know nerds Um yeah No no you're   100% right And like but then then going back to 
the same thing is brand is so important to us   Quality is so important to us that we're not just 
going to whip up a low ticket that we're going to   sell in a weekend Like maybe back in the O OG days 
we would but now with like where we're at with   things it's like goes through the process goes 
through the creative director goes through these   the packaging is there the graphic designer's on 
the back to make sure all the assets look the same   Like you guys know how it goes as it showed Yeah 
Yeah You kind of slow down over time versus when   we were in Bali us three and I first met them in 
person and like this whole thing We shot a course   in the living room and sold it like the next day 
and like it was still great quality information   but like that's just where we were at It's like 
let's film for 12 hours and do 19 iterations of   the VSSL on page until it's perfect And it's like 
you know the those two are rock stars The ones who   the co-founders of this company are rock stars 
They put so much grit and time and like just ram   their head against a wall a thousand times on 
I mean gosh I think of them and him having the   marketing mind and her being the actual one who 
has to you know portray the message and like do   it and him just being like again again again and 
her having to reshoot it and re-shoot it and like   we're all learning it doing it live and like they 
were rock stars They were rock stars 12-hour days   no doubt for years doing this thing That's what 
it takes That's what it takes I just love this too   data data data Like you have to be resilient You 
have to look at this You have to iterate and you   just have to do it And then what works Pick the 
winner and then iterate again Yeah And it's not   just going to be optins Revenue Yeah Yes The path 
is math Yeah People lie Numbers won't I like that   one I like that one Yeah Ryan question for you 
Uh you're a student of the game clearly given the   library that's behind you I want to get into books 
in a second but my first question is maybe you can   pick an honorable mention if you'd like to you 
uh one thing I want to commend you on and Russell   taught us this I mean god since Chris and I were 
children but um always invest in yourself like   right never be afraid to pull out your credit card 
and buy information You have bought a plethora   of courses What sticks out to you What's made 
the most impact for you in your career Um it's   been when we're in a pinch or we want to learn 
something new and I can just devour it and it's   it's solving a specific problem that we have right 
So like we have paid more I mean like mid hundreds   of thousands for stuff once we've already been up 
and running that oh we don't understand how this   works in sales management or whatever and we buy 
the thing for five grand or now internet marketing   land everything's 20 G's but uh it's like that or 
the like when we were doing the initial launch I   had bought Becker's thing cuz I wanted to crack 
YouTube and it was also about info products   and VSSLs and that was like life-changing We had 
bought consulting.com ovens had the most thorough   products ever at the time and like we bought 
that and that's then how I met Luke as well   and then we operated based on a bunch of stuff 
that was in there Um Cole Gordon has fantastic   stuff and we bought his stuff um at the time and 
like you know he his multiple hybrid approaches   and then his like marketplace side of things His 
stuff's been fantastic Oh I made a video on this   that was like I'm not a guru but I buy everyone's 
course like thing And it's just like wherever I   have an interest at the moment I've now allowed 
myself to kind of just freely aimlessly do this   Uh just with the understanding that I am not going 
on a side quest I'm doing it for fun Um but the   ones that have been really really impactful have 
been the ones that have directly over overlapped   We bought Alen Sultanic's ultimate what our 
automatic thing and like it's like 20 bucks   or something and next thing you know I'm buying 
NHB and I'm learning this and I end up seeing our   CMO as like a guest speaker in there before he was 
our CMO and more so for me thus far has been the   people we've met in there and then the quick wins 
we can add because you're at when you're scaling   into something you are learning how someone else 
does it but applying it to your situation which   sometimes cannot work let's be like let's be 
honest because it's not in the same conditions   but sometimes can be a massive multiplier effect 
Like if you can pay 5 grand 20 grand or if you can   just learn something one little golden nugget when 
you're doing a million a month and it changes a   five or 20% swing or whatever number it's large 
and it pays for these 5K courses or 1K or 15K   thing like really really quick That's the whole 
idea of the masterminds It's like you're paying   30 grand a year 50 grand a year 100 grand a year 
but you get in the right room and whether it's a   person you meet that changes it or it is a little 
golden nugget that you change to up your opt-in   rate by 3% it's like you made 100 grand back No 
doubt No doubt So totally honorable mentions are   probably those OG ones just because they were so 
impactful and where we were of learning was just   like very baseline Um but yeah some of the more 
tactical ones that we've bought and implemented   throughout the years has have been some definite 
like definite needle boos That's awesome it I   was actually in a mastermind This is a dumb 
story but since I've already opened my mouth   um we were at lunch and he was saying that the 
best advice he ever got from a mastermind he   shared at this table was if you ever get sued 
use a lawyer that has the same last name as you   And you're like "Look this is my cousin We can 
kick the can down the road as long as you want   Like you might as well just leave me alone cuz I 
can whatever." Yeah Yeah Cuz I can go forever It's   not non-billable It's nonillable My lawyer is free 
It's my brother So we can keep doing this for as   long as you want And my sister's an attorney That 
could be my golden nugget of this dude I was like   that could save tens of like I mean I was like 
that's worth the adission right there So anyone   listening to this Yeah take that with you Um Chris 
we got to get into seg segments real quick I know   we're almost kind of stretching it Yeah let's do 
some segments real quick All right cool Sements   Uh yeah brought to you by clickfunnels.com our 
sponsor today Go to ww.clickfunnfunnels.com and   listen carefully Click start a free trial 14 days 
on us Don't worry about it We've covered the cost   for you Go ahead and check it out You're going 
to like it Chris hit rhyme with some segments   All right So here's what we're going to do This 
one is going to be um well actually you know what   We're we'll start with Hero to Zero to Hero So 
here's the deal And I think I kind of know what   you're going to say but especially now that you 
know what you're I mean like all these numbers   Do you remember the book that Russell did a 
few years back 30 days It was literally hey   if you lost everything and had to start over from 
scratch you don't have your name you don't have   your reputation you're looking on your bookshelf 
for so you know exactly what I'm talking about   So we're going to play this All right there you 
go Ryan you've lost everything and you got to get   back on top What's the strategy that you're going 
to implement in the first 30 days Nobody knows who   you are You don't have any money but you have 
your skill set What do you do I am going to do   the exact model I'm in now I have the skills right 
You got the skills I just have no money and no and   no network Yeah Okay Yeah No I would go and find 
somebody that's a non make money online personally   Uh for example I heard somebody that was doing it 
with how to grow the largest pumpkin in the world   uh and got up to insane numbers but I would 
build an expert business 100% I would partner   with somebody uh if I had the skill and the 
case studies you can get majority all day   uh ownership of that thing and you own all the IP 
you own the brand you own the domain and then you   have an expert in it And I would rip a call funnel 
I would have a higher ticket offer because there's   more room for error and more cash flow in it than 
low ticket Too much iteration on low ticket for me   and where my skill set stack lies Um and I would 
do that and control the narrative You can get   feedback on the phone calls and run it And then 
there's backup and then there's low ticket and   then there's team and there's whatever But like 
yeah if you need to get to 100 grand a month like   that like that's it for me Love it It's a good 
answer Super cool Yeah it was fantastic Ryan for   for people that are watching for people that are 
listening right now um that live under rock don't   follow you where do we send them Where can they 
go find more information from you and learn more   Yeah Uh I just started doing YouTube 80 something 
days ago and I've uploaded every single day with   a lot of tactical stuff in the beginning and 
breakdowns and funnels and math and tracking and   all of that and then has now transitioned into me 
doing some like interviews with cool people like   you guys So uh yeah just my name on everything 
X Instagram YouTube all just my name and you'll   find it Go follow him Great job Ryan This is 
fantastic We appreciate you man Great interview   I didn't even I didn't even get to plug you guys 
for for your 1.0 but this is no joke This is   uh we use all of our order forms for our sales 
reps are still on ClickFunnels That's awesome   Love that So we have 30 Yeah 30 of those Low 
ticket still on ClickFunnels The only stuff   that's not is like the main funnels that are 
on our main branded stuff But yeah we still use   Click Funnels on everything Love it Everything 
Cool Thank you so much Ryan Yeah Talk soon guys
