# He Sold 3 Companies & Built a Flipping Empire (James Camp) | EP71
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DehfS-IUtck

trying to do them on Zoom. What's up, everybody? All right, video of the day. I believe today's day 71 in a row of making these every single day on YouTube. And we've got James Camp. All right, what's going on, dude? I have followed him for years and years before he knew who I was, while I lived in my cave and just worked. And he has some really cool stuff, cool newsletter. Um, seen some of his content, some of your uh bro podcasts where you guys all pop on together. Used to listen to those on walks in Puerto Rico. So, full circle moment. But yeah, I mean these generally go just super super chill, get to know you, understand the business, struggles, fun, kind of interviewy, but more so just like you and me getting to know each other and figured out. So kick it off an intro, longish, shortish, however you feel on who you are. I'll try and keep it short, but I'm bad at that, so it'll probably go a little bit longer. Also funny you say that about like the pods because you know me and Colin and Norin two my best friends had this podcast for years and we were like you know we get like 3 4,000 plays a pod and we would be top 100 and you realize that this is true with all life that that as you get to that 1% like the astronomical difference between 98 and being number two you know what I mean and we're like how are we top 100 4,000 play as a podcast and you're like oh it just is a hockey stick curve of the speed at which it it pops up there but Um, cool. So, I'm James Camp. Um, I always describe myself as just an internet kid. I'm 37. I can't believe that I'm that old now, but I'm 37 as of May 1st. And so, that means I grew up with AOL and a CD ROM. And, uh, just wanted to make money and uh, and I like started blogging when I was 15. I'll give you like the probably the more internet marketer context of me. Started blogging when I was 15. Made a little bag. When I say a little bag is when I'll never forget the day I made like 35 bucks on AdSense. And uh and it was cuz I had some stuff go viral on Stumble Upon and Dig uh which are like just of a different era, you know, and I realized actually Stumble Upon people don't recognize it was like the precursor to modern social media algorithms, right? Just like is this popular? Is it hitting? Cool. We're going to show it to you. For anyone watching or listening, Stumble Upon was just like a like a website where it would just show you an interesting new website and then you could press another button. It would show you a new interesting website. Just stumble upon it. So used that, did that um and sort of did a deep dive into like a how to monetize better and got into affiliate marketing. Um you know, ended up becoming a mod on some what what was a precursor of money Twitter which were like big internet marketing forums. So it was just like you know a moderator on Blackout World and on I wasn't a mod on Wicked Fire, but I was like deep on Wicked Fire and these that's how I know a lot of the people that I think the Twitter guys see me interacting with today is because I've just been around this world for like 20 years doing it. um built a little affiliate network um called liquid offers and it was basically I just took my first big offer which was uh sorry this is a long rant my first big offer which was was okay good was f freecreditreport.com we were just you know hammering credit report offers um and uh yeah and then me and one of the owners of one of the um big internet marketing forums came together like we could just like launch a network to with a BST a bicycle trade thread to this forum and we started broking that offer. Started broking a bunch of other offers and I bought a website um old domain ho uh file hosting website called uploadforever.com. This is before this one like you had to like download a torrent, you know what I mean? And uh God, I'm aging myself so aggressively with this. Yeah, you're in your like fourth or fifth one, but it's good. It's most guys on here are not that. Most of the guys I've talked to so far or even the ones I like plan to are within the you know an OG in this is five to 10 years of because a lot of them are info coaching or like you know brand but they're they're not 20 year none like well it's interesting because there's some dudes that very luckily what you realize with Twitter is that people give me credit just because the social proof of that people follow me that they trust right and some of those dudes like you know like I'm sure like I had a conversation with Adam Young the other day I'm sure that's because Jason Jason Appbomb follows me and that's because Jason Akitive follows me, right? And so we're just going back into like the old Wickedfire people, right? And sort of like how and so that's just old enough there. Um anyway, bought upload forever. We took this file hosting website and we just threw CPA offers on top of it. Everyone would call them now, what does everyone call them now? The I call them zip submits and email submits. Everyone um but it's just uh sweeps. Everyone calls them now basically, right? Um, we were calling them dashboards. If you're on the back of Money Twitter, you see the dashboards and you know those are sweeps. Those are sweeps for sure. So, we were running so we would just like lock all the content. So, you want to download the song someone uploaded. You had to fill out the CPA offer and then you could download the song. And we brokered that and and arbed that. Um, we sold that was not a big win, but my god did it feel like a big win for like 20 years old. Um, met a dude at ASSE um who had a a network bought it from us. And then I became I blew all the money in nightclubs became a nightclub promoter and uh and that's how a lot of the world knows me is like I worked at TA Group and Buttergroup and MM and I didn't know that played in the top Yeah. I played in the top sort of little niche of in the height of bottle service you know 10k table minimums was a moment in time when like Calvin Harris was huge and and you know the chain smokers and all this stuff. Um and during the day I do like digital strategy and at night I would go stand on a bank hat and chug a bottle of whiskey and um and I thought that neither world would think the other world was cool. So, I didn't really tell anyone about either. And then by 26, I was ready to leave that like so fast. I dropped out of college at 21 with eight credits left to this day to become a nightclub promoter. Um cuz I thought that was like the path of I mean, I would have signed a contract in blood. You wanted to pay me 1,500 bucks a night to to bring 10 girls to dinner and to a nightclub? Sure. I mean, it felt like it was a dream for a 21-year-old kid. um ran off to Malaysia, you know, hit up everyone at TA Group that was like still had love for me that I was working there and I was like, "Oh, I I got a what it was. I got a contract doing strategy for Mckenzie." Um so very upmarket, different sort of world. Um uh doing basically like SEO strategy for one of their um one of their practices. Um grabbed that money and ran off to Southeast Asia and sort of just reinvented myself. Um yeah, came back to the states. I promise that the the rants on who I am is done soon. Was uh somehow got plugged into Okay, good, good, good. Somehow got plugged into Google Launchpad, which is one of their tech accelerators. Started mentoring there. Came back to the States. Had a friend who was a commodities trader, and this will bring us up to the Twitter world and probably how you know me and how most people know me. Had a friend who was a commodities trader trading oil derivatives. I actually met him at in nightclubs at Lava. Um, and he years and years prior and he was like, "Dude, you've been working at like Mackenzie and Google, right?" And I was like, "Yeah, why?" And he's like, "Canabis is the next big commodity. Let's go build something." And he had this little Wix blog and it was called Daily Marijuana Observer, like the longest thing on the planet. And it was just about writing about pot stocks in 2015. And so I came on board like two or three months after he started it. We call call each other co-founders like technically Jake had founded it two or three months before me. We took this little Wix blog and we decided we were going to like build ETF uh indices to license the ETF providers and we were going to take that cannabis was the next big commodities. So, we're going to take like a gram the price of a gram of THC isolate and CBD isolate and license it to CBOE and CME so we could get 10 cents on every futures contract to the end of all time. And like it was a very we wanted to create like the Cushing Oklahoma which is for oil, right? The Cushing Oklahoma of cannabis in Colorado. And don't get me wrong, I still believe that that cannabis is a massive commodities market um that will exist one day, but legislation makes it not possible. We failed at most of that. But in that, we built some pretty large financial news websites predicated on uh cannabis equities, so wheat stocks. Um and because some of our investors were investment banks, um we were able to take part of some capital raising transactions for companies IP and ended up getting equity in a bunch of different little random brands. We built some drop shipping stores off the back end of some of our sites using like Oberlo because it was just easy to, you know, you know, we do like millions of visits a month on a site about investing in in pot stocks, but we might have a link that said a word that said bomb. Okay. Well, I can't sell a bong on my website that looks like a Bloomberg terminal. That's not going to work. But we could have a link on it. Anyway, sold out in 2020. It's all coming together. This is all coming together in my mind. You and your monetization methods, which I'm sure we'll get to, but like your bread and butter. Yeah, I feel bad because I I hope it's interesting. I know it's probably interesting to you. Extremely interesting. You're good. No, no, please continue. Um so then 2020 peak co like like July 2nd 2020 that transaction closed and um first thing I did was go buy a house. That was a nightmare. You two you two were my partner Jake and I and our investors. Yeah. Okay. So two books at that point. Yeah. Although it's funny cuz it's really there's technically three, but I would now at this point I never talk about the affiliate network because it was like so small. I was just like and the numbers I was running on it any of the any of the money Twitter guys, the a guys today like bro it's like a joke what I was doing. I just was like early and it wouldn't even you know win. It's a win. It was I mean the thing about wins is like momentum and is like just as important as the money side of it. I really really really believe that and like it showed me that like I could do that kind of [ __ ] Um, so we sold DMO Holdings, which owned all the cannabis websites, equity, and a couple consumer package goods brands. We got lucky. We got lucky because of the timing of the market and a couple companies that we did some work for. We were taking stock instead of cash for ad placements on our sites. We knew they were IPOing. We were working with the investment banks that are doing it for them or at least advising on it. This was at a time when some cannabis companies were trading at like 100x price to sales, right? And so we would say to someone like instead of $100,000 banner slot on our site, we'll take 400k in stock, right? And so they're like sure because they don't because they're tight on cash, they're doing capital raising, you know, issuing stock is calling a securities attorney and them signing a piece of paper and shares are issued. So and then we got that all that was a good multiple and then there was a go public multiple. So it was like a good timing for us. Um amazing. Yeah. Then I then I started going on Twitter, dude. This was like if anyone goes back to my Twitter, I was like 2020 started yapping about Yeah. Yeah, just like what am I going to do next? And that's how nanoflips came about. I started just writing about um deals I was looking at buying and then that ended up bringing me well actually at that time I did I did a JV with Agora Financial um what way? because we built him I built him a they wanted to monetize my old lists and because and we my old partner bless his heart he was right he was like dude there's no way because our list was like full of like institutional investors and stuff and Agora would have just rammed you know a lot of really hard stuff you know um so I did a JV with SFP 7igure publishing over there built them a newsletter um and then I started looking at stuff to buy and I mean I'm skipping over chaos I promise to it's it's the short version and I and and this dude I was in like I had like 1,000 followers on Twitter, 500 followers on Twitter. I mean it was, you know, it's amazing how it grows. But it was like me, this dude like Coldy Mill Wizard, you know, who's D Fazio, right? Like who, you know, has like client ascension has become great in his own right there. And like a couple of a couple of us in a group chat there and me and a different group chat with like Cody Sanchez and like Nick Huber and a bunch of people like we're all like let's grow on Twitter. Let's do this. And so we're all just growing, retweeting each other's stuff, commenting on other stuff. And I started writing about deals. I was looking at Nano Flips. The newsletter was no intention of being monetized. Ended up buying Blue Angels Hearing, this DTC hearing aid brand. Um, this would be the second exit I talk about really normally. So, we bought that um grew that um pretty aggressively, pretty quickly. Sold that 11 months later to OpenTOR. Um, so we were Open Source's first acquisition at the time. Shout out to Peter who really ran that. I mean, again, I just have been lucky enough to surround myself with like super smart people people. Yeah. Um, Peter was the operator. Peter was a killer. I was just like trying to play chess and and puppeteer like a roll up that ended up not coming together, but we we flipped the first business. Um, and then yeah, Nan Flips came along and like Daniel Fausio, the reason I brought him up cuz he was like, dude, you should sell a course. I was like, man, I'm not selling courses on the internet. And then I started being like, well, okay, maybe I'll he was like, just post a tweet and if you get enough responses on it, you should sell a course. So, I posted a tweet and like 200 people were like, I'll buy this course. I was like, oh, whoa. And then I launched to the newsletter. We la I launched a I wrote one email, built a landing page on card and recorded like the worst VSSL myself and was just like if you guys buy this I'll build this and I sent it out to 1100 people 195 and we sold 84 slots in 24 hours. I was like oh okay like 17,000 from a 1100 person list like there's a there there. So that ended up becoming a much bigger thing. Um that sort of defined the last two years of my career and buying a couple small businesses and advising on a lot of them. And then now anyone will see one of my recent tweets or pin tweets is that I'm probably going to soon make my exit from that business. And whether that means finding an operator, I want to go build something again or raise a lot of money um to go buy something much much much bigger. So that's me, dude. That's sorry that's like a lot. It's not a lot. No, no, it's and it's good context because again I mean so from my perspective how I know you is probably around close to that 2020 range. Somehow I end up on a list sometime somehow I hear you on something. I couldn't even pinpoint it. I tried to look like quickly and it I I couldn't find but how many emails I have from you and from nanoflips. I have been one of your abandoned carts four times over. I No, seriously. I've been so close to doing it and you know people who listen to this generally have heard my stuff so I don't you know I don't need to go into that a lot but like we were in a place and space where we were growing the info coaching business and we're like this is just going to be a cash flow game. Now those goals have changed and shift and you know now it's full boore. It's 15 hours a day between the YouTube stuff and that and like I'm in it. But for a while there was a lot of free time. There was a lot of time. There was a lot of there's capital and I was just sitting like what can I do? And you were the only one that had that pocket of now there's a couple that you know talk boring businesses and stuff but even that is a little more capital intensive. It's more operationally intensive. your stuff is small entry still like large game playing or you know chess like you said a little bit where it's you're buying because and you have the leverage but it's small enough it's approachable enough and it lives within that online space and I'm like those check the boxes like you know I have hundreds at at that time like I have hundreds and like I can play this and it's all online which is the only thing I know so it's been super interesting to me and like your emails where you go here's how I would do it or your emails of here's how I did do it or someone who in the in the program who did do it bought it changed monetization models. It's super interesting to me. And well, I think to be honest with you, dude, you would I mean, first of all, you're you're you're you remind me of my boy Orin who just like clearly amazing operator, but like will just win out of just sheer brute force. Like you're a way to stick with YouTube, for example, is like like the craziest. I don't know how even cuz as someone who's created a lot of content before, I think people discount it's very difficult and you probably know this from playing in the info world a ton. It's very difficult to continue to truly operate businesses and be really really pushing on content at the same time, you know, and people and and it's just the the truth and people don't want to admit it, but like one of the reasons that Nano Flips, which I ended up buying online acquisitions.com, my plan was for it to be a much much much bigger thing when I saw cuz it's the only business in my life, bro, that like, you know, was doing $100,000 a day by accident. You know what I mean? And I was like, "Oh, what?" you know, like, and again, just happened to have some of the best DR copyriters that were friends of mine that came in were like, "Dude, we're gonna, you know, like running, you know, Travis Sego campaigns to the moon, like just pushing really hard on stuff." And if you, you know, if you've been on the abandoned cards, you know it, right? Like, we were doing no phone calls, nothing. You know what I mean? Just like straight to straight to email. And I had some amazing people help me with that. But it's really tough to do what you do, man. I've tried it a million times and I always lose momentum with it. And uh yeah, so kudos to you. Yeah, I mean right now I talk about this a little bit, but like the it's it's a fear I have. I talk about all the time on focus on these people who are like, "Oh, I want to go do multiple things. I want to bolt a s a SAS company on here." And it's like it just it's very very very unlikely that you are going to be able to do everything well. And for me, and if you zoom out fully, it's like you have personal life and you have business life are like the two main buckets I look at. Like within personal, you have like your health and fitness, you have your relationships, and then this this YouTube personal brand thing is this weird hybrid where it's like such a fuel right now. And I I I want to share a bit of like what it's helped with, but it's such a fuel for the business, but it is such a personal time suck if you just look at time. And like I am failing miserably in the relationship bucket like friends, family, partner, like that stuff. Like it's been a huge strain because I just added four to five hours that I didn't take away from somewhere else. I stayed I stayed doing everything I was doing in you know my gym my this and that part and then I stayed doing and actually took on more within the work capacity side of things and then bolted this on did not like you know lose you didn't readjust at all at all so it's been a it yeah I mean you're 100% right it's it's a grind and I don't know how long I'm going to do it but what you are doing and like the model you're doing is makes so much sense to me so like are you trying so when you're saying you're going to potentially get out of this and do that so let So, I'll give you more context, I guess. And so, this actually brings me up to a great point, which is that go deep. Everyone says they want to go deeper on these. They want trench talk. They want just like I mean, I'll tell you I'll tell you the uncomfortable truth about buying businesses, first of all, which is that most people just will fail, right? And that's just the honest truth. It's I I think it's a great way to mitigate risk on failing because you're buying something that already has some traction from compared to a startup. I think astronomically more likely odds for you to win, right, unequivocally. But I think that what's happened what I learned for me was yeah trying to juggle five things doing five figures a month I mean like it's not it's almost imposs I'm sure someone better than me could do it but what I've realized is that like the times I've made well a lot of money for me I I don't like to call myself rich I'm definitely far from rich right but like and I had a conversation with a friend who had some bigger exits than me that was like dude we're just the richest of the poor don't get it twisted you know like like you know the other the the context for that is that like Harvard's giving you free education under $200,000 now and this admin wants to go taxfree below 150k in income. That means they think 150 200k is like the bottom of the [ __ ] you know what I mean? It's like that's the poverty level, right? And to the new elite. Um so like I'm the richest of the poor. Does that mean that I can like I'm not worried about how the rank gets paid? Sure. Does it mean that I drive a nice car? Sure. But you know Adam's out here telling me to come charter some PJs? You know what I mean? I'm not, you know, let everyone else try to those PJs, bro. I'm good on spending 40 grand to fly from LA to New York, you know. Um, like, and kudos to those who want to do it. But that's also for content. Half the guys in our world that do that are doing that for for content. For sure. For sure. Yeah. If there wasn't any Yeah. Cuz you and I I know some people with real money that do not fly private all the time at all. Would never do that. Just a crazy financial decision. Yeah. Um, but anyway, so in the weeds, what I'll tell you is that like the only times I've made real money, uh, and I mean like significant money, um, came from like really hammering down on one thing in a really aggressive way. Now, what I do I think that that could be done through a large fund structure in which the the businesses that we buy would be big enough that you can place a great operator, yes. Do I think that everything that I've done at Nano Flips is fantastic for you want to buy a side hustle or maybe a tuck in to tuck into your business? 100%. But I will say to anyone right now, if your goal is to buy 10 things for 100k and scale them each to 5 million at at the same time without a ton of extra outside capital to pay for that, the P&L just doesn't make sense. It just doesn't, right? It just there's not enough margin to pay somebody to do it and you don't have enough time to do all 10 of those things at once. So, I found for us the sweet spot was, you know, someone like Ryan wants has business X and maybe wants to tuck in something. That's amazing. Then the the next person is someone that wants a side hustle. Excellent. You've already you've maxed out your 401k. You hate your [ __ ] job. I got something for you. Don't worry. And maybe you can grow it into replace your job. That's amazing. And then I've done a bunch of advisory work that's more like searchers trying to like leave their job and replace their job. But that my original thesis which is just portfolio of many which I still have a few of these little things moving and grooving. It is not possible to scale them all at once or maybe it's just not possible for me and I think I'm a pretty good operator. Um and so my thought on that P&L I mean you saying on the P&L is like it's so real. It's so real. It doesn't I mean I think dude I talked to a lot of the info dudes this is not a knock to some of the best info operators I know but like the I mean everyone's talking about 80 dude I know you and I have had conversation about some numbers you do. you got a bunch of plaques behind you. I got homies doing mid five figures, nine figures on info. I can tell you right now, anyone who thinks those businesses run on 80% margins, like it's just like truly delusional, right? They just don't know what a real P&L looks like. Um, so anyway, so that's so Nanoflips has come to this point where it's a beautiful little business. It helped me build this beautiful little flywheel. You buy something, I can push it through Nano Flips. I have a great network with it. It's phenomenal. But for me, it's like I want to go either go really deep into like and I kind of have this software thing I've been working on. That's what I was talking to Adam about. And it's funny because Adam was like I won't give away to our whole conversation, but he was just like he was like, "Dude, B2B Sass is like real is like big boy business." He's like, "I'm telling you." He's like, he's like, "This is real entrepreneurship. If you go do this, this is not the DTC [ __ ] you played in. This is a different world." And like and I'm looking at that as like an amazing challenge, you know? Um to go do that. So anyway, yeah. Yeah. No, I think the the nano flips, the we talk about this a lot on here because it's definitely where my frame is right now and I think that just influences how what the conversation ends up. But the depth in which you choose to take something is it's real. It's what maps out to your goal. You could take nano flips and as you just said just the education info side of it could be here. You could have high ticket. You could have you know ascension. You could have done for you. You could have macro flips on the back end that's 50k and you could have the big boy stuff, you know, I mean, you can do that. You can turn it into the marketplace for the for them. You could be the next flippa. You could, you said you had the domain for it to where you're thinking it like you can do it, but if it doesn't align with goals and if the goal is progression, challenge like in that way and that's not like fun and exciting to you, it's like why do it, right? It's like you can do it anywhere. I mean, so there's two things it brings up. one which is that like I'm going to say something that's sort of a hot take in terms of personal brand here and because everyone's like anyone can have a personal brand. The sad truth is that is just not [ __ ] true. And now anyone can create internet can create content on the internet but like there are certain and I like listen I won't speak for you. I'll speak for myself. I'm like a seven or eight on personal brand. I'm a yapper. I'm somewhat charming. I'm probably sit in the middle of the bell curve even though I think I sit to the right cuz anyone we all think we sit to the right. So by definition that means we all sit in the [ __ ] middle. you know, but like the true people who are just crazy good at creating content, that is their lane. That's what they're phenomenal at. And so I realized that for me, and you know for the info space better than me, is that like most of those brands that do super well, especially a decent margin, are very, very guru focused. They are very, very, very, very guru focused. And I am down. Listen, I love being the center of attention sometimes, but I did not want to make my entire life being like a personality, if that makes sense. Agree. Um, and so, you know, to do look at any info product business is doing crazy numbers. I'm sure there's outliers. There's at least a guru who's getting a a fee to be the face of it. 100%. Golden Hippo, Agora, look at any of the big heavy hitters and you'll see, you know, the new reach dudes, all you know what I mean? Like I, you know, how much you think, you know, the sub two dudes are really flipping houses. I don't know, maybe a ton. You know what I mean? But I'm just get, you get my point, right? Um, and so for me, I think that what's going to happen with Nano is like it becomes an education business that can continue to push deal flow in a way that has for me, but it probably will never scale because I'm going to remove myself from it, if that makes sense, right? Like it can be like right now we're just running, you know, uh, a couple things through meta, right? It was all organic before, right? And so that just becomes a pretty simple I just think I have a good angle on on bisop. I mean, if I really want to go there, you know, make money MMO, bisop stuff is just like skincare for men. I mean, the truth is we're just, you know, we're just selling the skincare for men here in that world, right? Like, you're going to attract the opposite sex. That's all bizop and MMO is, you know, um, at its core. So, I'll keep that business because it's too good. The problem for me and what I'm going to do actually is with that newsletter is give everyone an option to opt out like five times over the next six months and then anyone who does not not opt out of Nano Flips, well, they can opt out whenever they want. But opt out of joining James Camp's newsletter. Um because Nan Flips will continue to talk about Yeah. And because I want to yap about just everything, dude. You know what I mean? In the same way first 13 minutes of this was me, you know? Yeah. Trueest personal brand and like the ability to do that and like be like free in that way. Right now it's like sucking up a lot of my time in the personal brand thing, but it it's it's really just me. Like I'm just I I'm doing what you're saying and yapping. It's not about a specific thing. I don't have an intention of it's, you know, it can't only be about buying these nano business like that version of it. It's about this, it's about that, which right now is a lot about business because that's where I'm at in my season and frame. Yeah. The goal is not to sell something at all. So, it doesn't go a direction. Well, I think to be honest with you that you talking about it being your season is really important. I like to think of life in like chapters and seasons. And I actually feel like I made a tweet about this the other day like I feel like a new entrepreneurial arc loading for me. And there's actually a Naval conversation I listened to. I think on the Chris Willix Wilkinson podcast um when Naval was just like what happens with personal brand and I've seen this firsthand. Okay, this hits well that's what I got to talk about now. This is who I am now, right? Because this is what not for two reasons. A cuz subconsciously my brain is just dopamine chasing non-stop, right? And so I want whatever resonates. And then B because when you start tying a business into it now that's that's the only person you can beat. Now, what you're going to see also, you know, pretty I'm sure you know better than me. Most info product dudes will I mean with big personal brands which just change their offers all the time, right? They burn out an offer and move on to new new. But you end up in this cage. I built for myself. It was really freeing and I need to re re um pin at the top of my Twitter, but it was like I lo talking about be losing my obsession. And obsession beats discipline every time. I'm a very disciplined individual. I know you're a disciplined individual, but obsession just crushes it. It's different. Obsess discipline is me getting up at 6:00 a.m. to go to the gym when I don't want to. Obsession is me waking up at 4 because I can't wait to go to the gym at 6:00. You know what I mean? And it's just it's just that's what I'm craving again. And this I think we can we can enter into sort of like we can talk about like funnel structure and stuff all day. I'm happy, dude. It's my favorite [ __ ] But I I think that like what's this arc of my life, this season of my life is thinking, okay, how do I shed this old version of me in which I now have 85,000 people on Twitter, 25,000 on Tik Tok, and 6,000 on Instagram that all think of James as nanoflips.com, right? And as cool as that is, I think that we forget uh that as we want to change our identity, so much of how we view ourselves is predicated on the external feedback that we're getting about who we are. Yeah. Um, and so that's so I would say though that what's interesting about personal brand is that you're in the perfect place to do it because you don't need the money from it, right? And so that allows you to to have this like sort of total intangible magic. Dude, I've seen that list of people you're going to be chatting with. You know what I mean? Like it is it's obscene what you it's like I know I was having a convo with a guy who who left his business to go work at [ __ ] the other day, right? Great idea because everyone at [ __ ] is going to leave when they IPO with a gang of money. He's going to have spent five years with a ton of [ __ ] other people in their 20s who all of a sudden like 50 million bucks, 100 million bucks and they're all like trust each other and been in the trenches together. And so, so my point is sometimes just like putting in the effort to the intangible becomes truly magical later on. So I think it work well for you with the personal brand stuff. Yeah, 100%. And it's just like the the [ __ ] example is so real. I mean, I flew out and talked to those guys and I felt that same thing. I was like, do I stop doing this portion? Like, they have such a draw to what they're doing. The mission they're on, the the energy of what they're doing, the obsession, like you said, that like is so real that it it is it's intangible. It's intangible. And the money is you can paint it out to here, you can paint it out to here. Like, it's it's bigger than what you're going to do elsewhere in almost 99% of the facets that you could. But, yeah, I don't know. For me, the the personal brand thing I I say in the beginning of the videos, it's it's talent, it's opportunities, and it's network. And for the first 60some days was just mass output. And it was a bit painful and trying to find pockets of things to talk about that were actually valuable and the feedback loop of that and trying to like navigate. And then once I got to that range, I was like, okay, I did some random one-on- ones and stuff like this and they just were like bump like 8x higher, 8x higher. And it's it's obviously at some level like the audience from those people that comes over kind of, right? like it'll be interesting to see how many people are interested to watch from your pocket of you know people that want to follow and hear about you that then come and watch this and whether they right but more so what it turned into was the network part worked the network part worked in in 50 days of doing this it's whatever 5,000 on this and 5,000 or 4ou whatever it is on a couple of these and it worked so aggressively that that list half of it is like I don't want to say like pipe dream but kind of like out of reach but everyone on that list is at least one away now not one or two or three everyone is one away and then half of that list I either are already randomly in in contact with or has comment back on something is like is right there. So like that part worked and then opportunities I actually like I might even shift what I say on that because I have such a mass flow of opportunities I cannot even explain to you like I can tell you offline and whatever but like this week I've had three two technically that are over three million a month that are doing bigger numbers than us in info and coaching and then one that has so much opportunity to do so and is making like no money but has like the following the audience and just doesn't have the monetization models and I'm just like send me a Google doc or a loom or whatever and I'll answer your questions but I I'm taking like no consulting deals. I'm taking no equity deals. That's not like a, you know, oh, look at me thing, but it's just it's just to show how crazy it is if you're in this world and in this pocket and just put it out there, which I didn't do for years. And then the big one that is working really well is the talent. So, the ability to find talent through the network of people is been insane. We found chief of sales directly through this from somebody who watched there, then followed me on X. We talked back and forth. They're doing 30 million a year in info, too. I've never even heard of their company. He his sales manager knew somebody who knew somebody and like sent it over to me. And in two hours of me making that posting, I had 200 people. Four were crazy good. Interviewed all of them, wanted one, got the one. And now we went from, you know, x days to double with the same lead flow, same volume, same quality because he, you know, whipped the sales team into shape and they're two weeks in today and like literally boom, we're now like on pace for record months in the next month or two. So it's like it's just about surface. I mean, I think when it comes to I mean, here's the the shitty, funny, sad reality. All of it. It's like all the tropes are true. You know what I mean? Like, you know, like it's it's about it's about, you know, surface area essentially, right? Like how much opportunity are you creating, right? I had a call from a friend today. Love him. I never really had sales teams, but for a while when he needed some work, I had him sort of doing some appointment uh setting and a little bit of trying to close on the phone, he closed a couple leads for me, but it was just not for him. It was totally fine. Yeah. Um, and we don't really we weren't doing uh we did one push with calls. What's really tough to get sort of tactical for a second um about info and launches is like if you run a launch model, which is how I ran for a long time. Okay, let's say you have 100 closes and and you you know you have 100 closes that have and you so you have 100 slots in a cohort. We weren't lying about those. Those are real. So have 100 slots, one close. Okay, let's say you're closing one and three, one and four. Maybe you're closing one and two cuz you're a god. I don't know. I always hear these numbers of close rates. I'm like, okay, maybe for like the hottest inbound for someone who's been following me for three years, right? But also, if you're getting qualified leads, right? You're not just taking money from anyone that wants to pay you money because that was a big thing for me, too. I didn't want to just take because my program was cool, pay me a few thousand bucks, but then you got to have another 50,000, $100,000 aside, right? And it would been very easy if I just cut Clara deals, you know what I like or just like you know and been like oh I'm going to show you how to buy zero down which by the way it's totally possible but just very unlikely for most right um so but yeah 100 closes at a 25% close rate means 400 sales calls have to come in right so you want to do it in a week let's say you were a magical magic let's say you could all of a sudden stand up a sales team of people that could handle that right let's say in a fiveday week let's just say I would take you go seven obviously let's say say five right so now you're taking you know 120 Oh, sorry. Sorry. 8 * 5 400. Okay. Yeah. You're taking 80 calls a day. Okay, cool. 80 calls a day. Now, you have to assume that those 400 people that you're booking calls with, that all their personal lives are happy to be lined up sequentially to get on calls with your sales team. It's just not possible, right? It's just not possible. And so, that was one of the difficulties I ran into. I did a I ran a thing with like nothing but true love. And do you know Nick Fischer? Yeah. So, I did a thing with Nick one time, like nothing but true love to him. Like, his team was awesome. We ended up deciding not work together long run. We were going to try and build some bigger stuff out, but like thank God because thank god that was a team that had come from running like real big, you know, and that they could just make a phone call to like the sub two squad, you know, I mean, and be like, "Oh, I need, you know, we need 30 reps now. Yeah, I need 30 reps to be on calls this week." And I think that people don't recognize how difficult it is. So anyway, so I had a friend who I've like been giving advice to. His wife runs like a like a IVF offer. Actually, she's an IVF nerd. Like it's a great offer. It's I I hate even calling it an offer. It's amazing consulting that truly helps out people that really want to have children. And like she's been having some stuff hit on TikTok recently. He's like, "Dude, we got a 100 DMs. What do I do?" And I was like, "Answer them." You know? He's like, "Oh well many chat doesn't really work for Tik Tok. Can we try and flow it this way? like should we get I was like honestly dude like how many hours on the day do you have just sit on your phone you know and I think that people try and overoptimize early for like because I've been with gurus who ran their own stuff doing a million a year who just and I'm sure forget even info I know dudes who run a lot of big businesses that cannot put their phone down you know they're traveling the world all the time their wives are hate them for it but like are just literally working 16 hour days non-stop and so I think that we all try to over optimized but I know it's not even very useful like thing to talk about but I was thinking about it sales teams and how to stand it up you know no I have so many thoughts from that I mean the just the last part of it is like that's me right now I'll just tell you that I'll tell everyone right now that is me right now and like I said earlier is impacting relationships family friends partner whatever you want to look at it is uh it is not good I'm on my phone 24/7 whether it's an ex thing or a YouTube now or all of the business all day and the random calls for that it's like you got to pick your goal and know that like we that it's either a season and hopefully it is a season for some of that stuff if it's not what you absolutely love and you're okay with impacting those other zones of your life but if you're not at scale like ch you got to change the model you got to change the model you got you got to bite margin in your company because you got to hire people to do things and be okay with making less because other people are going to do pieces of the puzzle like and that's where you go back to your P&L not working on stuff it's like if you can't do that and the availability thing just quick tactical again is so real We have always run a sales team. We have never done direct to cart ever. Even on our direct to cart we have now that we recently launched low ticket. It is a sales team directly on the Otto. So we are we are a slave to the calendar availability in a 48 hour window. And it's always the the rock and hard place of like getting availability up. And we all we do paid so it's the most consistent. We have very little organic. But the second you try you get a like a viral moment which we haven't even had. So funny you say that, but like that or you try and do anything that's JV or like a like a mass push, you can't do it. You I can fill 150 slots a day and I have a 48 hour window because if I go beyond that, my show rates go like this. So like we for four years now or f probably five years have run directly on that. The next layer of that is the low ticket which is the first widget is only for a setter team. So you have two dedicated teams that are both having availability. So you have however many low ticket units a day. Then you have 60% of them or whatever that then want to book the implementation quick start call which is a setter. That's a 15-minute block. How many calls can they take? And then the setter is on the phone live looking at the availability of the closer team and booking out 48 hours in that window. And you just play this game of like we need more setters on this cuz we're getting a low cost per acquisition. So we want to sell 200 low tickets a day and that means 150 of these calls which means 50 of these calls. We got to pull overall ad budgets down, not on low ticket because this calendar needs space or you got to hire for it to fill and then you don't fill them and then you have like expectation like it's almost impossible. I mean, and it's and it's it's one thing that you probably not you but one people I don't think realize till they really get to like a level of scale. And that's not even like for me, you're doing way more than I was doing with the info stuff. What I think is really interesting is that when I think about business, whether you just said or what I said cuz I mean to anyone who wants to go look in it, like I mean all all the funnels I ran for for my info stuff, I mean I didn't write most the copy. Um I worked handinhand with someone that they were like I I don't know if they want me to say they are but they're like amazing people. They're they're truly truly cool. Um they were running like oper like info operator models way before it was like a hot thing to go do. Growth operator was a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They were like, "Oh, you have a list this size. Let's have a conversation." You know what I mean? Let's chat, bro. Cuz I cuz and I remember like, you know, wiring off $100,000 to people that wrote like 10 emails and I was like, "Oh, whoa." You know, like, you know, for a day or two of work. But anyway, and I remember I had a a moment, you know, like you have the old school dudes like Doberman and Dan and [ __ ] They'll write you a sales page. You want 100K, 200k, they'll write you a sales page. Anyway, but everything you're trying to do, whether it's what you're talking about, we're not talking about, we're basically trying to compress all the trust um and information and objection handling possible into as small time frame as possible, right? So, the best conversion ever is going to be in person to person. So, like very tactically, when people are like, "Oh, well, how do I go launch this?" Go to a [ __ ] conference. I mean that with every fiber of my of my being. If you are I mean, that's what I used to do, man. I was a hungry 27-year-old kid with no money. We raised I took a $100,000 in debt personal loan to from an investment bank and gave them 30% equity kicker in my business because I was just because we had a Wix blog and we were making no money and they were like, "Oh, you're going to get a couple million investors a month. We'll figure out how to monetize this later, right?" And so we would just go to conferences and I would go meet public companies and be like, "Oh, like we've got ad space to sell you." You know? So my point is that that is the best way to sell is going to meet someone because now Ryan and I despite having a bunch of Twitter combos now we've met face to face and I'm much more likely to do real business together. Right. The thumbs up that come from this mine off. Yeah. Yeah. Um but so you have that right and then how do you compress that? What's the next level of that? Probably sales calls. One step down is going to be a sales call. The next step down is going to be like a DM combo. You want to compress that more. It's going to be a VSSL. you want do you want? But all everything you're just trying to do is take the entire like the entire uh pipeline of what is like getting to know someone, getting to trust someone, objection handle, and trying to compress it as close as close as possible. Now, most most the info dudes want to do like one call closes and they want to be selfquidating day one on a VSSL. It's just crazy because when you go play outside the info space, if I told people that you could be selfquidating on ad spend with their business, they would like melt, right? That is just not how most business not know what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. They wouldn't understand. First of all, you know, like I'm I'm I'm playing in a world now, you know, I do some, you know, there's a company I work with. It's a equity crowdfunding portal that I'm doing fractional CMO work for right now. I have a little piece of big fan of what they're doing. But my point is like we're bringing on issuers raising money, right? And so the business I'm going to to looking to build next is also like 3 to six month sales cycles would be a tight sales cycle. Like 6 to 12 would be like a more realistic like cuz the level of buyin that has to come in from different people and like how and it's like Yeah. So you're just there's no get making your money back day one or day 10 or day 30, you know? So 99% of businesses know. No. And and so I think that like so actually for a lot of the info dudes, you know, you really want to scale. Obviously, you're trying to get money back in your pocket very quickly to keep scaling, right? Same thing with the affiliate with with pubs, right? You want a 7-day, you want a net three, net seven because you need to dump your money back into ad spend. But I think that a lot of the the info guys I know that haven't figured out how to scale like the way you have, if they could just take a step back and think about like a like a 30 to 60 day to 90day break even instead of like a like a 7-day, right? They just they would find that as long as they had the attrition to stick it out for those 30 or 60 days. Well, that's Yeah. And the trough, the cash trough is the like you said affiliate example, like depending on your source. So yeah, let's get tactical. It was fun. So the I have talked to a couple people on here and so we have we're paid heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy like it is 99% of our first click is paid. We have a massive organic engine that only exists for that for the consumption and the moat and that piece. Yes, it would be great if it was also cold but it's really just like retargeting and you know if we're talking media buying terms it just exists as a consumption moat that can be there which most people don't have. And I also know companies that are bigger than us, they do bigger numbers that have no moat. So it's not to say it's necessary, but it is a a helpful additive. So the three funnels that we run right now, speaking specifically on consumption, is the VSSL opt-in funnel. So name, email, VSSL, application, book a call. That one is what we did 71 million through raw, straight up. That's it. No setters, no any fancy direct to car, nothing. And we overdid it. We hit it too hard. We scaled into it when the CPA was rising. Like last year was our explosion. Like we went from 12 million to 30 just by changing what we sold. Not by changing the funnel. When we had been running the same funnel doing 10 and 12 the years prior just selling an info which has you know no fulfillment cost to coaching that then had a higher ticket but also fulfillment costs. That's where the team goes from 30 to 100 and something right like that. There was this whole shift but the consumption that can exist at this funnel versus the two other ones we're now running which is direct application. So, no opt-in, watch a VSSL and then either be able to apply instantly or like wait a little and apply versus a low ticket which is for us, you know, sales page, get an opt-in so you can get some emails in between, abandon a checkout, then push straight to a call that's like part of what you purchased and then go to a close. So, the time frame and the consumption levels are like two massive levers. So, it's funny you bring that up. This one is still the best because the amount of re like the the time frame is the longest like you're saying. Sure. The consumption is the highest because we are constantly like re nurturing. We send two emails a day every day of the list every single day. They have the contextual ones in the beginning for the first 30 and then the people that don't they still get two emails a day. We have like you know win back style uh stuff that just just to re get them in the content. We have this massive content mode. The DTA ones are like, you know, show rate through the floor, like they don't even know who you are half the time. Like there's some of that happens, but like we try and do our best. And then the bottom one is the most interesting in both the economics and the consumption because they're not a lead, they're a buyer. That's the first time we've ever done that to where a buyer, even if it's $27 or 100 or whatever your low ticket directly is before they get there. There's some definite drop off with like how many book a quick start implementation, there's definitely some drop off then how many go to a close, but when they do make it to a closer call, it has the highest show rate and it has the highest close rate of any of the calls. So, if you can get your math to work out, it's like a a crushes. Crushes. Now, it's how, you know, how cold can that product be? Can is it a mass market? Because if you're only popping 5% out the back, which depending on who you ask is either amazing or terrible because I know guys who do 2K direct to cart and have 50% ascend because it's, you know, a big enough thing that just the implementation for another 10 days is like nothing. So half them will do it. And then for us, I know people who do 3% and make it work, but call it five. It's like I want to sell 50 units a day now. So how many low tickets do I need to sell? And that's that's where that model is like, oh, because it's like it's like economics are amazing. But now sell a thousand of those a day and consistently do it at the right CPA so that your math does work and that all your availability and all your stuff over here because all the call calendars, it's like that's the game. But what you're saying about consumption is so real and if you can get them into the system, however you do, consume as much information as possible. We have stuff. Uh Jeremy Haynes is a really big guy in our space. Um that is like he's the the million a month guy and he's very heavy in ads, has an agency and that's all his content and he has this thing called the hammer them strategy which is essentially just consumption ramming and he would pick them and as soon as someone books a call, it's like an email every two hours. The thank you page is like filled with like pre-objection blocks, testimonials, and then he has the hammer them strat, which is on Facebook. You'll take your buyer, you'll take your booked call list over whatever the range is, so like 72 hours, you will like HubSpot sync it to a Facebook audience, and you will run like like however many different clips of pre-objection block videos, long form, testimonial, short form, whatever. And every time someone does a through play of one, it removes them from that. So they see a new one and it's in dude, I think it's a 20 frequency. like you're just like boom. Well, so that leans into that. There's a couple things that makes me think of and I don't want to forget them. So, one that makes me think of is that like uh a there's like I won't say his real name, but great follow on Twitter. He's never talks anymore. Um I almost said his real name like uh GT3 I forget what his his Twitter handle is, but it's GT3 something like one of the better DR dudes I know. um left the infospace to go build a different kind of business um and take his crushing at DR stuff, you know, with him. By the way, which I think if you wanted me to sum up one model Yeah. If I you wanted me to sum up like one way to make a ton of money and it's sort of been the thesis of my life and I'm hoping to do it again in a big way, which like it wasn't I wasn't the best DR marketer, but like the affiliate stuff I was running. I mean, I was just hammering Craigslist back in 2010 or whatever. It was a different world. But you know um all the stuff I black hat world is like just a spam for now but back in the day like 20 years ago or 15 years ago it was like the best we called the methods not courses. It literally was a method. You could like buy a method for like 200 bucks. First first thing first like thing that I bought there that did what was a PPC ARB I ran between seven search and uh and Google. You could just this is a different time when you just ar PBC clicks between between search engines. Um anyway, point is uh yes, so GT3 he has a funnel where he broke he does a funnel breakdown. It we used to be pinned to his profile a long time ago and basically it was like that it was the first survival kit and the first piece of that survival the first thing says fellow patriots. Well the copy says fellow patriots because it knows the liberals don't like the term patriots. It knows the liberals are not buying that [ __ ] So it's trying to be as divisive as possible. It is trying to push you as far away as possible. I think that what happens for most entrepreneurs, myself included, is I'm like, "Fuck, I got to defeat churn. Everyone's churning. I don't want them to churn. I want to sell them later." The truth is is that many most of those churns are not buyers, right? And some, yes, some are going to churn and leave you and they're going to be annoyed that they saw you. But it's just like who the sales dudes I know do that do the best? The dudes that call you till you tell them to leave the [ __ ] alone, right? And as much as we all want to be the good guy. Now, there is a overlap with brand quality here that I want to be careful with, but in the DR info space, I'm I don't get I wouldn't be too worried about it. But my point is what you're saying there is just like hammering them till they turn out because you're just basically getting the people that are really interested to finally just convert. The second piece that goes with that is um I took one marketing class or advertising class in college. I'll never forget it. And the first class, the first thing they taught us was like the professor was like, "So you go to the CVS and you go buy toothpaste. There's Crest and there's Colgate. Which do you buy?" And I said, "Crest." And he said, "Why?" I was like, "I don't know." Cuz I use Crest. He's like, "Exactly. You're you are going to buy from who you know, that's about it. The most basic thing to know is that especially in a commodities in a commoditized market where unless you can truly differentiate yourself when products are similar like it's just who you know, right? So that is just hammering the home about who you know. The third thing I wanted to touch on there is that where I see a lot of people drop off is people run ads and this goes back to the sort of consumption thing and sales cycles, right? So, everyone worries about converting someone day 1, day two, day three immediately, whatever, whatever. But if you just can what you're saying Jeremy is doing is basically what I'm trying to talk about doing over 60 days. Mhm. He's doing it hyperaggressively in a way that probably turns some people off but others it really works for probably works correctly for the P&L with him. Right. But what we're doing is like trying to compress years of you getting to know me into a tiny tiny tiny time frame. And so I think that what one thing I don't see a ton of and I know when I you know I know when I hop on a call with someone selling something that they're going to that they're fun as well. If before I get in a call they're sending me two or three pieces of content that are about it. later after the call there's more content to follow. You know what I mean? Like it's just getting me to trust them and get to know them when it comes down to it, right? Cuz mostly objection handling, by the way, goes out the way when you trust to know someone. This is why gurus work so well, right? So there's almost no objection handling. If I love Ryan, I don't have objections. I'm selling him whatever he wants to buy from me. I mean, I'm buying him from when whatever he wants to sell me because I just have a belief system in Ryan. This is why cold, in my experience, is sometimes easier to sell services done for you than it is to sell it done with you. Because time with James is only valuable if you [ __ ] know James. True, right? Like, if you've never heard of me, why do you want to spend time to pick my brain? I've never heard of that. That's so real. It's easier to sell someone on a done for you introductory offer into something based on like this brand that does this. There's all this social proof from them. And then if you want time with James that works if you because the truth is and you know this for sure when you talk about the $50,000 back end that is about being close to the guru. That is what is that that is that is really what that is about. It's about access. And one of the problems I had with me being a guru was my friends who helped me run a lot of stuff. They were like never thank when you finish your cohort for you shouldn't be on cohort calls. It should be other people. You should be never thanking people for being there with you. They should be having to pay to get one-on-one with you. And I was like, and maybe just a childhood trauma. I just want to be valuable. But like, dude, there's been no one that's ever bought something from me. Are there people that didn't get a win? For sure. They've never even opened the program. I find it insane to me that I can see someone paid me money and never opened something. But anyone that ever did anything, and there's many of them, they have my email, you know, I mean, like I'm talking to them months later, hitting them up like, "What's going on? How can I be helpful?" You know what I mean? Um, but that's because they want access to the guru. I actually hate the term guru. When I worked with Nick Fischer, I was like, "Dude, this whole team, we can never call me a guru. Let me just be completely clear. I hate it." So anyway, that's a rant a little bit, but I think it's real though. It's real. The I I had a call two or three days ago with Ahmed and he was the first one that directly put it out in front of me a little bit like that where you know, most things are the done for you, the guru, whatever is the back. It's the back up here and then it's like the do-it-yourself. It's the book funnel where it has all the same information. simply put and then back here is all the same information but someone's either holding your hand or getting you the result and it's like that ladder is generally how it is 99% of the time where people are willing to pay and the cost goes up across right their model and was so interesting to me because it's in like trading communities and you can believe what you want around that or not but the lowest tier and lowest ticket thing is done for you it's a signal chat it's a whatever where it's like someone just giving you a stock pick or whatever and again I don't know who believes in what or what I you know not my game interesting perspective is that and then as you go through it the top is still the guru but it's like the education portion it's the learning how to do it yourself learning how to do it yourself so it is done with you it is like right but the true done for you is like right here in the beginning and it's like that's so interesting to me on how you can flip the models around and you you said it briefly but so they do everything organic everything is long form YouTube so the trust is built so they are truly the guys that have margins that are like 60 80 whatever because the fulfillment model is one too many sure community managements whatever and then this has its own thing with events and whatever but that's large high ticket but the main business is a subscription thing and the organic instead of having to pay 30% or 50% or whatever to acquire the person of their initial you know their rorowaz bucket it's organic so they have a content team I'm sure in their stuff which has some cost but like it's su it was super interesting to me that they did that and for us and then I'll shut up and because thinking but the when you're saying the when you're saying the consumption thing for us. Our CMO brought this to my attention. I'm just learning so much from these conversations and from what like season again that we're in. But our CMO calls it the the uh value vortex system. The VVS is the three funnels we're running because you're right, there's only one to 3% of people that are ready to buy up here, right? And like yes, we like hammer them by sending them two emails a day, but a lot of people don't open the emails. They don't have, you know, it's like that's okay, but that one is the long tail. That one's the one that has a you know 3 week or three month average depending uh sales cycle from lead to close on average. These ones down here compress it like you're saying how it compresses that time. Sure. So for us we try and dance that line of like where are they at in their consumption journey, buyer journey, whatever you want to call it to where up here it takes a lot of time and one in a hundred are ready to buy like right there on day if you you know run it through there. These ones are ready in four to five days. Like the average right now for our low ticket ascension is four or five days because of their framing on how they come in. And these middle ones is like we don't even know yet. Like it's it's all over the board on the numbers, but we try and systematically do the consumption to where we don't do that hammer them strat and all that until they book a call. So they're already deep enough in the funnel to then you hammer them with that instead of just like trying to get a 20 frequency on brand awareness the second they become a lead. Like we're trying to dance that line. And now we're doing a hammer them strat that's like a light version that's for leads that haven't booked a call but it's completely different content. So like what you were saying is like the trust in the guru the whatever over here you're trying to get them to believe in the expert the guru the whatever you want to call them by having like like framing around that and like authoritative content to make oh this person is amazing they're the best in the business and then over here it's the pre-objection blocks it's oh it's around you know what does this thing even cost how do I know this is going to work for me that stuff is over here and and ar and like trying to architect it where the consumption is in buckets and can be compressed strategically well this comes down to single I mean I'm a real believer in like single product funnels in some regard right like I've really and that just goes like I mean you really want to be meeting customers where they are right and so uh I this is where discovery calls a discovery call should actually be a discovery call in my mind right like as a people pitch as somebody who does a lot of one call close our our model is definitely directly built around one call close it is there's a heavy level of discovery yeah you really have to because it's not a here's the problem as a guru right when you work with this is why I've had problems with outsour with commission only sales teams as well right it's in misalignment misalignment of incentives so you are completely aligned to just sell anyone anything now I have to fulfill it for them right and then I have my you know my NPS is lower my churn is higher my stress is worse that's all terrible um but you know there's some some of the there's a you know like Tai's team is just basically just discovery. They won't sell you anything until they know and then they will sell you whatever fits exactly into where you're looking for it. I think I want there's something I wanted to touch on which is like something I have to keep hammering into my head so hard and it's just like one of like the biggest fallacies of business that I think what what'll be interesting is in this conversation certain people be like wow this is so insightful and people like man this is so [ __ ] obvious you know but so you know one things that feels really important to me is that when we talk about P&Ls and we talk about funnels we talk about CAS and all this is that you if you're just getting into this you sort believe that like and this is I think a fallacy about all business at all levels. You think once I figured this out, well then that's figured out, right? Oh, once like once I hit once I find this ad that converts that way, well then I can just pull the spreadsheet out all the way because we're going to keep converting at that CPA. We're going to keep getting that rorowaz, right? This will go on forever. And the reality is is that you're just cons I mean yes there comes some stability with certain things but in general whether it's paid especially if it's organic which you're at the whim of the of the algo right like you are it is a roller coaster which is how we started this combo before we started recording right like this roller coaster of entrepreneurship and you're constantly rebuilding the plane as you fly it right and I think that probably one of the bigger things to me is that one of the reasons that young guys do so Well, often is because they just believe in themselves. They they've not been proven wrong yet, right? So, just like ignorance is bliss. Ignorance. Ignorance is bliss. You don't know what could break or even think about it cuz it doesn't exist. Or worry about reputational risk or sort of, you know, I mean, I'm blown away these guys with no ship methods. I mean, that's just like wire fraud. I mean, for real, like like crazy crazy stuff. But, you know, everyone's just figuring it out. Like I'm dude I there's so many business people I look up to and I'm sure there's people that look up to me. I'm just constantly just trying to figure it out and I'm sure that they are too at 37 what I'm positive of is that I will never have it fully figured out. Do you know what I mean? Like it just constantly, you know, figuring out again and again and again. Yeah. I don't know. I mean the the reputation thing is just to touch on that point is like so it's very interesting to me because that's the whole an on Twitter. That's the whole you know Telegram chats. There are some whales in there and whether they're doing you know white or black whether they're doing this or like and some of the guys you see them that are like doing black or gray hat whatever style stuff that still want the actual like not Anon just like they want the fame or the clout or the whatever and are willing to just throw their name out there on what they're doing that is literally illegal. It's like and I see them from because Jason comments on them and I I see that's like my trail to find those because they don't exist on my I'm here. My my camera just died after an hour. You're good. Sorry, dude. You're good. Um Um You can still hear me, right? Okay, cool. What? I can hear you. Yeah. Do you have an um Yeah, it it works in Zoom forever, but for some reason it it like whatever. I'm still here. I think by the way you know everyone even thinks that the anon listen in my in my back in my day there was a moment in time where people were doing what's called cookie stuffing and cookie stuffing was just stuffing your cookie into someone's browser to steal their affiliate commissions and there was a myriad of ways to do it you know with a MySpace page I won't get too into the weeds here but with a MySpace page you used to be able to put JavaScript on someone's MySpace wall so you would like you would put like what looked like a GIF on like Justin Bieber. He wasn't around then, but like on a Justin Bieber fan page and you get a million people a day that came to that page and it would jam your Amazon cookie or your eBay. eBay was the big one. EPN, eBay Partner Network, Pepper Jam, I guess, a long time ago. And everyone was shopping this before Amazon was big. You know, a million people get your eBay cookie with a 30-day cookie in their browser. You end up getting commission on anything bought on eBay uh over the next 30 days. So, people were making crazy money like this. Actually, Honey got into some weird stuff about this. But my point is there was a guy back in my day who was a big cookie stuffer making a couple million bucks a year and fully anonymous on Blackout World. And you know what happened? People in windbreakers showed up to his house one day, you know, broke down the door, took him and his hard drives. And so I think that like every it feels, oh, whatever. Because people are through the internet, they don't feel like they're scamming people, you know what I mean? like they're there's no difference between the no ship method and like going and taking money out of someone's pocket. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. No, no, I don't. Yeah. I I mean we we've never played in that game. Like I the re the way that I know a lot of these guys for the affiliate lead genen and stuff or like you know even by proxy is sure like following them but I live I lived in Puerto Rico and did that gig for the last three years and one of like my main friend down there uh is a big media buyer and I'm sure I actually might know at some level but it's these two guys that just crush it and they're lean team. It's literally them. They have all these great you know direct deals so they don't really go through a lot of networks. They'll do random affiliate stuff for fun but like their big big thing is lead genen. So they'll do ACA, they'll do debt, and they'll go really deep in it and just crush it. And so I kind of got around that and was like, "Oh, this is so cool." You know, it's money in, money out. Like it's a pretty simple business model. Not to say it is easy, but it is, you know, the the model of it versus having all this team and these, you know, client base and all that. So I got really interested in it and started just looking and looking. Ended up in some of these Telegram chats and stuff. And like just the export portion of it. It's crazy to me how many are willing to, you know, kind of like just directly do it or bolt things on that do that. Like there's just so much risk and Jason talks about it a lot on his like the the actual like what you know the story you just said the risk around it and that's even from claims let alone full you know no ship or this again everyone's playing their own game. I mean I don't morally align with it and like I will never talk [ __ ] direct on someone. Like I just have no no ambition to do so and where someone's at in their place and space in life to where that makes sense. But like I don't know. I just don't know how you can it's just not worth it. I think is you know forget the moral ethical side of it. Probably not worth it. I think I think that actually uh it's I don't know. I think it's a younger dude's thing. You know what's interesting about the X stuff is that as you and I both know there's so many just like crazy hitters who are not on X and are not talking Yeah. and are not you know what I like and just are not yapping about stuff um and want to avoid being public, you know, mo, you know, like fully. They have no interest in that, you know, and then there's a lot of people that are just yapping nonsense, too. Oh, no. 100%. It's hard to it's hard like the Gary V's and you know, Hormosi did the playbook and these guys and Cardone and stuff, they like, you know, put a big light on it and then a lot of people went and did the whole now here's, you know, the teach guru how to guru type thing of how to have your personal brand. And there's a place for it. There's also a place for people who don't have any skill and stuff to you know document the journey but it's a dance of like sharing stuff that is actually impactful like you said and just yapping which I I will put myself in that bucket of like there's times where it's just kind of yap or just like what's the point of even sharing this like is this really going to be beneficial to someone but circling to the reputation portion and then we can even pop if you want if there's no video coming back and we can do a round two. That's another I feel bad. I feel bad. I just I just know I just know how this is gonna look on YouTube and it's just me talking like literally I did one of these with uh with um Brooke and his video didn't upload fully and I didn't know and I exported it just quick cuz I was in meetings put it up here and literally I look at it later and I uploaded it 15 minutes at the tail end of me just talking to myself. Well, let me let me let me just you can chop out this one time. I'll just open up my laptop and then it will be at least it'll be an ugly video of me but it'll be at least finish this. Perfect. But yeah. No. So, reputation wise, like I I'm, you know, I'm terrified of that if I'm if I'm being completely honest. Like even like sharing the stuff. You were talking about just like staying in the shadow and just like building. And I have a huge back and forth like internally about that on if it makes sense to share this stuff, if it doesn't. Like there's total there's huge risks. There's huge cons. There's, you know, big pros too that I'm feeling, but there's there are cons like and for me the reputation that was built or private or whatever was probably not that good in like an earlier stage of life and trying to, you know, the ego and the the making money early and just like how I was trying to be and what I thought I needed to do like it just wasn't good and that was not on the internet thankfully right at that level like I wasn't like you know sharing or trying to and even now I come out here I'm like oh you know these numbers we do and it's impressive to some and it is peanuts to others and like I try to make that the frame is there of like I'm aware of that. I'm very aware of that. Like I'm trying to network people that are of this similar. I'm not trying to tell anyone how to do anything. I'm just sharing our experience and like our opinion of things. Um but yeah, I think I I don't know. It's just the goal of progression on things and just like trying to be okay with reputation and know that it is an everchanging like you talked about in the beginning, the people who just like silo themselves and get stuck in that forever. I want to avoid that as much as possible. This is an everchanging thing. There's plenty of people that have done a good job. Like I I always use Iman as an example like how he started in this little bucket of like I'm a teenager trying to get clients. Now I have an agency. Now I'm teaching people how to have agencies while still running mine. Then he was like I want to go overall online business then personal development and then like fame and he his personal brand ascended throughout that that he built and he did that like he's a workhorse and he did it and he like brought everyone along the journey without it sticking to the past of like oh I'm the agency guy or oh I'm just like the online business only guy. I mean, like, he still kind of is, but like he dominated in that way. And I think he's done a great job. I think it's And to to what I'll say is this, since I can't get my camera to work, we should do this again cuz I I got a couple things. If anyone's still here, you got you got to comment on one. I've been doing this. You got to comment a one if you're still here just looking at me talk to myself basically. Yeah. Hop back in from the beginning. So, hold on. What I would say about the that is that like I've come to the conclusion recently that it's totally okay. And there's a I used to say like every business has its exit, right? every business as a Dutch East India Company. You think of the biggest businesses on the planet, they no longer exist today. Um, America will fall, the dollar will fall, English will not be the language of the of the of the future one day. Every Bezos says it better than me, but like almost no businesses last 100 years. My point is, it's totally okay that a business has a certain chapter of your life and that who you are has a certain chapter of your life. And I think one thing I've struggled with reputation-wise is like how do I become this different version of me or or this maybe this thing fails. What does that mean? And I was like literally like 3 days ago I was like wait maybe for example with Nano Flips maybe Nan Flips had a really amazing peak and was amazing and now it's going to become this little side hustle that someone else runs and I collect a dividend from and I go sell it, right? Um and that's okay and I'm ready for the new the new chapter of my life. I'm ready for this new entrepreneur arc. I think that like with that said, it's important to keep a good rep. The the only thing that was going to stick around with you all the way through is going to be your reputation, right? But like it's okay if the business model changes. It's okay if you do different things, but the reputation will stick around the the entire time. So anyway, I got more, but I'll shut up because the screen is black. No, no, no. You're good. No, no, we'll wrap it here. I think I mean part two would be fun cuz I I where my brain was with that whole thing is like what if we just workshopped live on what Nano could be where it would be a challenge that you would enjoy it but you I dude I was going to go into it because I can tell you the last thing I'll say with this is that like info is great but some of the biggest info has a different backend than info and I thought about that a lot with Nano. I think Grant Cardone has probably done it better than most in terms of having a super big back end. Cody Sanchez has done it. You know what I mean? But anyway, so that's something we Let's We We'll wrap here. We'll wrap here and we'll do another one soon once uh once we get everything dialed in and we have some time in between. We can both think on it. All right. Cool. Cool. Well, everyone, what? Find you on X is the main spot. Yeah, find me on X. Uh Jameson Camp or James on camp. Um I unlike Ryan, I'm terrible at following through with YouTubes. So like I'll I'll do one every three months. I think I like seven in total there. But um that's the James Camp. Same as as Instagram, the James Camp. And uh nanoflips.com. You know, for now you'll be getting, you know, things about flipping businesses, but pretty soon I'll force you compliantly onto another list where I just yap about my life. So I love it. I love it. Cool. Yeah, we'll definitely do another one. So I appreciate it. Sorry for the timing and and not understanding the video lengths and all that, dude. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's all good. All right. Well, cool everyone. That's day 71, I think. And we're just going to keep these going. So, you have to let me know if you like the interview/con conversation style of these. I do want feedback loop because I am iterating real time. So, whatever you guys can give me in feedback in the comments on if you like these, if I actually finally shut up enough because you we're all talking that I talk too much. So, I'm trying to trying to limit that a little. But these are conversations, not full interviews. So talk to you guys soon. Hit me on X.
