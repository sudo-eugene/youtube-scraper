# you should NOT have a SALES team... here's why | EP106
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcU8k3HEldo

In today's video, we're going to be talking about why you should not have a sales team inside your info coaching business, which is an extremely hypocritical take because we have over 50 W2 employees inside of our sales team across managers, operations, admin, closers, and setters. I'm going to break down why I think most info coaching companies should not have it and how it sits in the org chart. The different type of offer stacks and different sources of traffic that require you to have sales team, the differences, the headcount that equals headache, organic versus paid. our journey throughout this and what I wish we would have done based on two different goal sets. All right, this is going to be extremely helpful for you and I promise this will make sense in the end. All right, last year we did $30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over I think it's actually 78 million now in total cash collected. We'll just say 77. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies opportunities and networking with cool people building cool All right, so let's get into it. Now, I'm saying you should not have a sales team. And when I'm saying you should not have a sales team, first off, you're going to need a sales team if you're selling generally speaking anything over $2,000. Roughly, roughly speaking, I know people who do DMs that send five and 10k payment links, but let's just say that like completely depends on the offer and the warmth of the leads and all that. But let's just use that as an example. When you're selling something over 2,000, you need to go to high ticket. Okay? You're selling something under 2,000, you can use direct toart. Now, most businesses, there's finance departments, there's all this other stuff, but we're going to use these three core departments. You're going to have marketing that's bring them in, which could either be your content generation team for organic, can be paid media buyers, creative, all that. You're going to have your sales, which is only when you're going to do high ticket. Okay? So, anything over that 2,00 or ascension even from the 2,00. And then you're going to have fulfillment, so who actually fulfills on the product. Now, within info coaching, there's a big difference between info and coaching. Info, generally speaking, again, is going to be login access. It's going to be the easiest fulfillment humanly possible with maybe some fulfillment that is a group manager, uh, community success manager, someone who moderates there, maybe some coaches that are inside a group coaching capacity. So imagine you have like a Tuesday, Thursday block on the calendar. People show up and there's, you know, 50 people on there or 500 people on there that ask questions and they get them answered in a group setting. Okay, that's generally how your info is going to go. I have other videos breaking down the differences between the other offerings in info coaching. Okay. But if you're doing something that is in the coaching realm, usually fulfillment is then going to be a bit heavier. Most people are going to do it in a group coaching setting or they're not going to even get to a scale where if they do onetoone beyond them or maybe like one or two coaches, it's really that fulfillment heavy. So, first thing on here is this headcount versus headache. Okay. When you scale this up, most people are going to first exist in this organic realm. Okay. So, I'm in all of the groups, all the info coaching groups. Some there's other ones without me. I understand. Like there's a lot of paid and a lot of free ones that I'm in where most people are doing this and doing a couple hundred grand a month upwards of like high hundreds a month. Uh William Brown who's on here example like he's at five or six hundred grand a month in profit and like you know it's 80 something percent margin. So he's you know basically at that in revenue or cash collected. Um and what their main funnel is is organic. So he has content that's occurring over here. So his editor, his thumbnail person is whatever uh scripting all that that exists in this marketing department which is extremely extremely light in terms of headcount. He creates this organic and then they go to high ticket. Okay? So then they have to go through a sales team and then the fulfillment is him and like two other people. So it's like two people over here and like two people over here or just like one person over here. Okay? Now where I'm saying this gets crazy and gets like all out of whack is the amount of volume that comes in is how big your sales team needs to get in terms of actual headcount. So when you get scaled up and this is our exact example right here. You're gonna have closers as your like core number one thing you're going to start hiring for because you need someone who can close the 5Ks, 10Ks, 25K packages after you don't want to do it anymore. Okay? So, you're gonna have closers. Stuff is going to start slipping through the cracks and you also want quality with the closer so they're not just getting every single lead. So, you're going to start introducing setters. Different people have different things, but let's just say one to one. Some people do two to one on setters. It can get all over the board depending on your lead quality and your flow and all that stuff. So those once you get up to a certain point of how big your closer and setter teams are, you need setter managers and closer managers. Initially, you may just have like player coaches. But again, if you don't have a manager, you are the manager. Okay? So like you are having them report to you. Even if you have 10 closers and you don't have any management, any setters, the closers are coming to you. They're reporting to you. You are the one communicating. So where I'm saying this gets crazy is this sales division. How can I do this to make this just look like it becomes this big big headcount portion when the fulfillment is so light and the marketing is so light. So you end up essentially running a sales team. Okay? And like if your goal this all comes down to your goal, okay? And we're going to get into that and like why I'm I I want to have 50 plus. I want to have 100 W2 sales reps, closers, um setters, closers, that whole department. But like why I don't think most people should do it is because most people are running info coaching businesses for the cash flow. Most people are running them as like lifestyle freedom businesses. And the second you start to do this, you are either managing them or your cost stack starts to add ad add and you're still managing then the manager and that whole department you need quality that it just becomes like this crazy headache. Um and your fulfillment can stay light depending on what kind of fulfillment you have or what um offerings if it's info versus coaching and your marketing can stay pretty lean and tight too. So like really this is what starts to grow and it just gets like becomes the biggest headache. So at scale you're going to have closer setter setter manager over all these. You're even going to have a setter manager. Then they're going to raise in player coaches um that are inside the department. So you're going to have like three tranches essentially a closer manager. You may even at scale have a chief of sales that overlooks a closer manager and a setter manager and then no player coaches. Like there's all these different ways to look at it. And then at certain scale you're also going to have someone who does sales ops that find that goes through the CRM that makes sure that the closers aren't missing things. um that make sure that the data is correct in the end of day reports that the da you know um the presentations on the daily sales huddle are all updated with the most up-to-date cash collected numbers you're going to have VAS in there that are doing things around the calendar like it becomes such a massive headache because this massive team size that's needed for the amount of lead flow okay now not to say this is like a problem not to say it's a bad thing it's just like dream build your dream business and understand this going into this before okay so you are not a Oh, marketing versus sales. These kind of all play into each other. I kind of want to like show all these, but like going through these different funnels, you generally speaking when you're doing this are more of a marketer, more of fulfillment of the actual product you are selling than the actual salesperson. There are different people. There's the Cole Gordens of the world. Love Cole. I think he freaking crushes it. He is like the exception to this and he teaches people how to be the exception to this. Like his thing crushes, but like most people are not inherently good at this sales function and able to do it or manage the team or actually close themselves or anything. Okay, so let's go through these and then I'll circle back. So, most people are going to start with an organic thing and they sell sell sell direct to cart. So, they're selling something that's under $2,000 and it's just like an info product. Okay, so they're going to sell send them to a landing page. They're going to buy something. They're going to get inside a community and all you have then is whatever your marketing team has needed to get this organic content or just you or a couple like super cheap VAS uh or editors or whatever. They're going to buy something here. You're going to have like 99% margins or whatever the math. And then some people are going to then ascend them to high ticket. Okay. Now, when you ascend them to high ticket, they either need to be have enough warmth that you can just send them a link or they need to talk to a sales rep or you or someone to be sold on the high ticket thing. That's 5K, 10K, 25K. Okay. The other option is going direct from organic using some sort of just like application funnel where they book a call and then they're sold high ticket. Okay. Now, this is extremely warm in person. A lot of the time people call these uh sales reps like cashiers because they are basically sold on what it is. They've been framed on what it is. They come in and they're ready to buy. Okay. So, it's an easy sales process. As soon as you introduce paid, this is where a lot of people are like, "Oh, I'm doing 300 grand a month or 500 grand a month. I'm going to start spending and I'm going to double it. I'm going to go to a million a month." When you introduce paid, all of this stuff can start to crack. There's things that can slip through the cracks and then there's also things that like just simply around like lead warmth, for example. So, you start to run paid to the same page that you're running organic to direct to cart and all of a sudden your conversion rate falls through the floor, right? Because warmth is not there, right? You need better sales copy. You need better there. So you start to beef up things in marketing or whatever. Okay, by the time this is kind of a bad example for this, but you're running them direct to high ticket. So you're running them through a call funnel or whatever, the same one that you're running organic through that was just converting and having 90 or whatever 80% show rates and 40% close rates. You run that same exact funnel to uh cold paid and now all of a sudden you have a 50% show rate and a 20% close rate with the same sales reps, the same funnel, the same everything, just a different lead quality or a different lead source more so traffic source. Okay? So instead of them coming from organic and warm, they're coming from paid and they're cold. So now all of a sudden you need a higher grade sales rep. You need someone who is a better sales rep. Now maybe you need more sales reps because you're trying to double, right? So you need double the amount of sales reps. So you need double the amount of people that are good sales reps. Okay? And maybe none of your original ones are. So now you're restaffing this entire team. As you start to do paid and more volume comes through and because you have no shows that are occurring and because you have people who apply but don't book at the same rate and all your conversions across the whole thing drop, you now need setters or you should have setters because you want to make sure that the quality is showing up for the closers. You want to make sure you're missing what falls through the cracks from someone who applies but doesn't book, someone who knows or cancels, someone who does all these things. So now you just tripled your team size from your initial three closers you had here. You now have six closers and they probably have to be different closers because they have to be better at it. Ideally not, but maybe. And then you also have another six setters, let's just say. So now you're up to a 10 plus team. And now who's managing them? You are. Okay? Unless you're going to have one that's going to rise up. You're going to pick your best sales rep that's the best. That's going to ruin it and everything's going to go to zero. Okay? Exaggeration, but I'm going to give you examples. So generally speaking, marketing versus sales, completely different, right? But if you use like Jeremy Haynes on his video yesterday, I was talking about mark uh backend sales system. So, he has so many things that occur post booking before they get on the phone with the sales rep that make it so it can be as much of a layup as possible. It can be as much of like a the closer is essentially just a cashier as possible. So, that involves a lot of stuff around using proper framing, using stuff that's within like the marketing realm as much as possible right here before it even gets to the sales team. Okay? So, you want to like focus on a ton of that. Who's writing the closer scripts? Who's doing the closer scripts? Because the closer script for this ideally is the same as this one, but it's likely not. But it's likely not once you get to scale. The huddles. Who's running the daily huddle every single day for 30 minutes or an hour, 5 days a week, sometimes seven days a week, depending on your volume and depending on what kind of culture you want to create? Who's doing the oneto ones every single week? Who is looking at all the end of day reports every single week? Who is looking at who is perform? Like you need to then build out a team to manage this. And again, it gets like this for what used to be your light simple business. you now have this big sales organization as the main as 80% of your team in terms of a headcount. Okay, assuming you're running a light business now motions, all these things. So, organic first paid already kind of got into but it's like the layups they're warm warm warm like they're just ready to buy is that you have room to fumble. So, you have much more like wiggle room in this than you do in this. And that's the same here too is like when you're running paid direct to cart like organic direct to cart, a lot of wiggle room. I have a great example of this on ours. I built the ugliest page you've ever seen that has uh that we were running for our low ticket and it literally it was converting at like well above KPI and as soon as we started to scale into it and paid we have so many leads inside of our system and so much of an audience that is like a large audience that's already seen our stuff that as soon as we started spending into it it was basically just showing to all those people. So it's converting, converting, converting. As soon as we kind of like spent into that audience or through that audience, it started going into cold traffic, which is where we wanted to be entirely in the beginning. Even if we were doing exclusions or whatever, it was still happening. It literally the conversion rate like, you know, turned 25% of the initial, like just tanked 75% down. And it was because this there's not as much room for how good the page has to be, how good the copy has to be, how good the offer has to be because these ones were warm. These ones were not. Even though we were paying, it was still targeting all the people that were already in our audience. It was essentially the same thing, like acting as retargeting. One call closes. These a lot of the time will act as one call closes. They're already good. Versus this can be upwards of two, three call closes, a lot of follow-up. So all of a sudden people start slipping through the cracks if you don't have a good sales team. If you're over uh if you're overfeeding them with leads and bookings, then they don't follow up in their pipeline because they're like, "Oh, the next one that'll come through just looking for the layup and burning the rest of the bookings, which now cost you money." that didn't cost you money in the same way for advertising that before it cost you in content. Okay. So, our journey on this and why I think that you should not have a sales team. So, uh and why I when I say that I still think you should sell high ticket and I still think you should have a sales team. I just don't think you should have your own sales team. I don't think you should have a W2 in-house sales team at scale personally or at scale. Yes. But so for us initially way way way back when, so I'm talking like beginning of COVID, we decided to launch this callunnel. Okay. So we had CS reps. We had two people on the team, two other people and then three of us, two co-founders, me who became a co-owner and then two CS and I think one bill one billing I think was the team. So CS reps were like, "Hey, we want to start running a callunnel." We put them on the phones, two of them. They literally were closing like 50% on day because again, we had this whole warm audience where we didn't even have this offering yet. And as soon as we had the offering, they could talk to someone, they had more wiggle room, they could then close them. Okay, we were selling a $500 thing over the phone, which is like the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, but like the economics worked because calls then were like sub $50, which is just like not the case anymore. So after that, me and the other co-founders, the two other co-founders decided to take the calls ourselves. So then we're having competitions. We're having fun. So we have these two and then we have us three. So there's five of us all taking calls at the same time, closing, building, building, building. Then turned into the expert brand face uh co-founder. She moved into the product side of things, building out the product, doing all the uh group coaching. We were selling info at the time. And uh me and Luke, which is one of the the other co-founder, uh began hiring and managing. So we were hiring from the sales community or from the uh customer community, which is like a major life hack by the way. So if you want to do this in-house, uh you can hire from your community because these are people who already are generally speaking the ICP already. So when they're talking to somebody who's a potential client, they're already a client. They spent the money on the thing. And where that kind of can break is if it's like, why are you a sales rep if you know whatever you're selling and you didn't get it? So like in ours, it works. It's fitness. It's like cool, they got the result and they want to make money. if you're trying to do any of this like bisop stuff, it's like why are you a sales rep here instead of you know being the trillionaire person who actually succeeded with the course. So navigate that lightly. But so we essentially built this up and we had 25 probably maybe 30 reps um that we had in house that were or in-house but they were 1099. It was kind of like gunslinging. We're like hey we're just going to give you leads. You could be in our systems but like more or less do what you want. But we were running the huddles we were running the onboarding. I was running tech office hours doing all this kind of stuff. And then we had one that was like this standout standout standout individual and we're like that person is a manager and technically speaking they had sales management experience before they came to us and they were a customer of ours. It was like the stars aligned. So we made them the manager so we didn't have to do the meetings and we could basically be like cool cash flow info coaching business. Life is good. And we let that run for a while. The sales rep ended up making like high three no 400s um for us that year and uh or no I'm sorry not for us like made 400 herself like in commissions uh and management fee. like crushed it and we had other sales reps that were crushing it. Like the whole thing was good to go. And at this time, this is a very important part of this. At that time, we were trying to just be an info coaching cash flow machine. And it was actually just info. We didn't even have coaching. We had group coaching inside the info product, but we were selling a one-time lifetime access um to an info product essentially. Okay. Never do this. Never have your top manager or your top rep become your manager. Everyone says to do it or says not to do it and you should not do it, but sometimes you just have to do things on your own to learn that you should not do them. Okay. Um and yeah, it exploded. There's a huge cultural issue. There was like a very different culture styles and personality and someone who's a top rep generally speaking is not a great manager. It takes different skill set. It takes different things around being able to manage these oneto ones and emotions and culture and like these different and management is just different than being a savage closer. Okay. So, we messed that up. lost like half the team in the process of it. We had to get rid of a bunch of people because they essentially were in this pocket and then we had to get rid of the manager because we just had to get rid of the manager and it was like this whole thing and then we had to rebuild. Rebuilt the team, tried to do a bunch of wonky stuff, but then we started to do the 1099 management thing. Now, at this time, nobody was doing 1099 1099 management really. That was like an agency as a service or like where they handled everything. So, there were different people doing 1099 management where it was just that. So they would come in, they would do some one-to- ones with your team and they would lead your uh sales huddles. They would do whatever and they would take a percentage essentially as like an override or a fee based on the cash collected, but they were your 1099 employ or your 1099 sales reps internal or W2 or whatever you had uh internal and they were just 1099 managing. Okay. Tried this for a minute and it just like wasn't a fit for us like the culture of how kind of sand was. So we tried it again with someone else. We're like, "Oh, it's culture/performance." and we did this and then these guys literally were like, "Yeah, you guys are too big for this and you are like you need an internal manager for like what you're trying to accomplish with this company." And at this time, we moved from info to coaching. So, we started selling one-to-one coaching, which was six times the price. Okay? So, completely different offer. So, you have sales reps that are selling something that's $1,500 or $1,000 or whatever over the phone. And now they're going to be selling something at $6,000 or or at the time, I think it was $6,500 um over the phone. That was onetoone coaching, complete misalignment. These guys were like, "You need to find someone internal." And they referred us out to this guy, which we was uh was a top pod leader. So essentially, generally speaking, you have a sales manager, you have pod leaders uh that sometimes um close as well. Um so they're like hybrids. They're like player coaches, and then you have their closers. So this pod leader was the top pod within the entire organization, and he was looking for like a step up in his role, and it wasn't really going to happen inside that organization. So he came over to us to be the sales manager. Okay. So came in there, went from 1 million a month to 3 million a month. Absolutely crushing. Cool. All of that to say then it dripped and does whatever it does and it goes up and down and marketing had issues and like I have other videos where I talk about what happened, how we went back down, and now we're back up and we're back at kind of like essentially where we were um pretty close to for all-time high months right now. So around 3 million a month. So all this now what I wish would have happened if we were just going to keep this as a cash flow business. I now there is such thing as a 1099 like sales agency. This is what I refer out. This is who anybody who asks me. I have two different people. I have one that I like really really trust like see all the results, see everything they do. Very system thinking, very this like rockstar. Okay. And like they only take on people who are doing over 100k a month already and have a 5k plus offer. Like that's the only ones they'll take on. And they will do both of these. So they run all this entire stack is them. So that's the big difference between when we were doing it, there was 1099 management only. You had your own team, you had your own whatever. they would just come in and manage it. Now you can pay like a 20% of your cash collected fee and they will come in and staff all the closers, all the setters. They'll have the management in there. They have their own ops VA. They're inside your CRM. They're updating everything. They manage all of this. All of this for 20%. Now, just for quick math on this, like depending on your stack and 1099 or W2, a lot of people say, "Okay, this is like 10%. This is usually 3 to 5%." This usually has a base plus a fee, so call it two points. This is usually this. This is usually like I don't I mean this is not relative because these are usually like base ones and like these are super low ones. But like just on this math right here, you're already at what is that 10 15 18 and a half points. Okay, I'm using as percents right here. Sorry, that's my math. So I'm saying like closer is going to make 10% of new cash. Uh setter's going to make three. Like let's like roughly say this is what it is. you're already at like 15 to 18% internal and that's with you then having to like manage it or then manage the manager and then have all these people and have them come in and out and staffing and like all of this craziness versus you can now hire one of these 1099 sales agencies that will fully manage it for 20%. Some people do 15 I've heard and some people do like 25 but like I know a guy that does 20% and literally crushes for clients like high high hundreds of thousands. cuz I know he there's clients that are million plot like crushes for them. All they do is take their rip and then all you have to do is never think about this in the same way. You still have to like obviously be attuned to it and whatever, but it's like this in your brain. Same way that if you have a marketing agency that actually crushes, it's like this in your brain. And yes, you're providing them with stuff and like seeing stats, but like it's like this and all you're worrying about is over here. Okay, massive oversimpl uh simplification of this, but like that's the idea behind what I'm trying to get across here. So, you shouldn't have a sales team. You should have a sales team. You should have a sales team for high ticket. You should do this portion. You should clean house on that. I love high ticket, but I don't think that you should have an in-house team unless you're doing what we're trying to do, which is we are trying to exit velocity info coaching, which is like I can't wait to watch this video in like three years and look back and be like, I was either so stupid, which I potentially maybe, or thank you. I can't believe we actually decided to lean into this and it worked. Because we're trying to build equity value. We're trying to build an internal train team. We're trying to be legal. We're trying to do all the things. So, we have a W2 internal team. We have internal managers. We have internal ops. We have all that kind of stuff, which we bite because when things get out of hand and comp plans overlap and whatever and you mess stuff up or whatever, this can be higher. Actually, when you have W2, it's 20% higher in fees right there. Then, so if you're paying someone 10K on 1099, it's call it 12K or PL depending. It can be 12K, it can be even higher um on what you're paying when you it's W2, true cash out of the business. So like I'm kind of trying to like play a different game. Um, but all I talk to is these info coaching and I'm like, "Guys, why are you worrying about having this ma like doing this and managing this yourself when net net the biggest swing difference you're going to have is like five points if you run this yourself and way less headaches like no headcount internal. Unless you are the sales pro and you can do it better and you can manage the cost and you can like get better efficiencies and you think that you and like you can do it like power to you because you can probably do this for 10 12 points and manage it yourself and do all that." like it will be tighter and you will make more margin. Yes. But just for the headaches of it alone, I think that this is like the total play. So, um yeah, that's kind of the gist of this entire video. So, we're doing it internal internal manager. I would have zoomed this up and not even tried these because this was painful for us. I also would have not done this. I would have gone from here to having a manager that we hired externally um that was from the space and we like did not have the understanding or wherewithal of that. And that was probably 2022, 2023 probably um on when this still was all happening. And then by 24 we had full internal sales manager. That's when we did 30 million. That's this year right here. And yeah, so like these years right here. So this is what 28 29 20 21 22 23. Yeah. So 22 23. This is when we were like fumbling around trying to figure this out. had the internal manager um I'm sorry, the the sales rep that became the leader and then tried the 1099 thing and then by like right here we got the internal sales manager and then rolling into this year. So like we had big months coming out of the end of the year and then hit it hard and then scaled into with an internal sales manager. So like I just wish we would have moved this over here. Not to say I would have had the same chart, but like learnings would have gotten me there. So we're trying to do this. We're trying to build this equity value. I think that you should not. So, end of the video, but this right here, this link, uh, you have to use the www, but I'm doing like a survey because I'm trying to understand who all follows me and like what the businesses are, what the offer stacks are. Like, you don't have to put your contact info if you don't want to. It's at the very end, but it's like what are your cash collected? Where do you sit on the Here, actually, I'll just show you it. Do you like my forest? Um, so it's like what niche are you in? It's what are the main offers? Like, what is how is it structured? It's cash collected. It's all that kind of stuff. what's your team look like? And I'm just trying to gather data and like if there's somewhere I can help, I would like to help. Um, if you go to here, www with a doc, this will show you all the videos. I'm on day like 106 or something in a row of making these videos. Uh, and I'm not stopping yet. So, I have a plan to go to like two to three week, but right now not. And then the Rolodex, I just rolled this out today. Today's June 25th, but people were asking me, they constantly are in my DMs asking this, so I decided to make this. These are essentially just people that I trust and either have worked with or like have already referred people to and they get crazy results. So like here are some of the softwares like 100%. So like you can go to these links right here and um I also have direct connects with people who like full set up all your accounts and do everything. These guys crush for external financing like they have split it and some of these other ones. Um and I can get you in direct contact and we have some different fee structures and stuff. Um processing lead cool thing for income qualification on leads. um crazy. You can feed back the pixel only like the top quality of not just based on what someone apply uh fills out an application but what their actual like income uh their access to capital all that high ad tracking best out of the box I use different things I use this and other things um I have other videos about that we still use click funnels to this day and then whatever all these things so I have marketing vendors I have guys that are like just killer media buyers that are for smaller people and then I have guys that are full agencies um both are the same you know similar cost stack on this but like crush um I have some guys that do offer I actually have one specific that does like different offers that either teaches beginners if you're a beginner or does full big builds and a lot of low ticket stuff uh offer creation for existing businesses that have something but need low ticket. I have this really cool ad spend credit card thing that kicks kicks back anywhere from like 5 to 10% on ad spend which is crazy. Some of these and the one I'm talking about today is this the sales full service agency. Um, so yeah, if you want contact info to this, I don't want to put all their info because I don't I don't I only want to refer over people that I think would actually like one that's in their ICP. So like example, the guy that I mainly like uh does over 100k a month people only. Um, and yeah, so if you fit that, then like yeah, just message me on Instagram. That's where I do most of my communication X um DMs, but it's harder to get through because I have so many. Um, Instagram's a little bit lighter. So yeah, if you do it there, then if you're a good fit, give me some context. Like I said here, DM with context and I can make an intro if it actually works or if it makes sense for you, if this model makes sense. Also, again, super hypocrite. We've run this entire thing in house this entire time. I'm just saying I think like hindsight 2020 looking back and especially if we were our goal was to just be like this cash flow biz. I would 100% do this. 100%. So hopefully that was helpful. A little bit longer. A lot of narration, but also I buzzed my head just foring sport. So that was fun today. But appreciate you guys and uh I will talk to you soon.
