# Jeremy Haynes Exposes Why Most Funnels Never Hit $1M/Month
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vdhMaotSOY

All right, good. What's up, guys? We're back. We said no more daily videos, but it's day 121 and we're here with Jeremy Haynes. Hell yeah. And we're in Miami. Part two. Part two official live and in the flesh. So, all we talked about last time was backend selling systems essentially. We talked a lot about the entire time. So, inner circle, you've got how many people speaking? We've got four all together. We've got you, we've got Jeremy Moser, we've got a a million-dollar a month trophy winner, Brez and uh his I think I think marketer is the proper title, Pierre. And um we've got um Oh, man. Who else am I missing? There's that bre scales. Brea is super cool. I see him all over everything. Yeah, I'm spacing I'm spacing on the other one. I got I got somebody else that's a heavy hitter, too, that's talking. But I uh I've done a tremendous amount of things today since it's the day before the mastermind. So, I'm a little fried. Excuse me to the other speaker. I apologize. No, no, 100%. So, Miami, why Miami? I've lived here 12 years. So, this is actually a really good story. Dude, you ready for this? Yeah. So, because I remember I remember the big house, the farmhouse was here. The big big house that you had. 12,000 square feet. That was that was in West Miami. Okay. Let me let me run it back. You want to go to the literal beginning? Yeah. Because Yeah. again. I mean, for anybody who watched the first one, it's like I was in DMM, so I think I paid probably 500 bucks and it was your second or third thing you maybe released. First thing you very first in park ever released. So, I don't even know where I came upon that, but yeah, you were doing content there. You had that cool office in the back. You had the big half circle thing up front with the cars like Yeah. Yeah. Okay. When I very first moved to Miami, I had a buddy at the time that had told me Miami is the [ __ ] He was here for like three days and he said it'd be way better than where we were currently living living. I was born and raised in Ohio unfortunately and I had left there when I was 18 naturally as any great person who wants to be awesome in life should. And I had moved to Denver, Colorado and I was there for about a year and even at this pace in which you and I are talking now, people in Colorado will tell you, they'll be like, "You're talking way too fast. You need to slow down." And that drove me up a [ __ ] wall. They had legalized weed that specific year. And I believe that also contributed to like slowing down society there a lot. And anyway, one one of my buddies I grew up with, he said he was like, "Dude, we should move to Miami. Like, it's the best place ever. I think it would take us to the next level." And this was 12 years ago. This was like well before all the CO era. I think a majority of people moved down here during CO and that's what drove the prices like through the roof. But it was insane. So, we didn't have any money. We were like impoverished. Okay. And we found a $900 a month apartment that we were going to split. So, I was I was going to pay 450 a month. He was going to pay 450 a month. And we looked on a map, and keep in mind, we didn't have money. We come down, look where we were moving, and it looked like we were moving to downtown. Okay. Do you have the Do you have the ability to pull up the address and throw it on the screen here? Pull it up. Pull it up. There's this address called It's You guys like the background? It's 535. Yeah. This is Ryan's YouTube channel. Yeah. Go on, Go on Google Maps and No, no. Go on Google. Go on Google, regular Google, and type in 535 Northwest 7th Street. 535 Northwest 7th Street. There it is. There you go. And then 15,000 square feet. No, no, dude. This was This was insane, bro. You're going to [ __ ] yourself. Click on images. So, first of all, look at the map. Okay. The map shows This is the image on the top right. Click on the top right image. The one that's the one that's brown and yellow. So, so this Yes, that one right there. So, so, okay, we didn't know that this was in the hood. Okay, we looked on a map and we thought that you see this bottom corner right here. Yeah. This is the unit that we lived in. Okay. So, we show up, bro. My boys started crying when we showed up. Like, literally started crying. We thought our moms were going to like be be like, "So, like we do we honestly thought we were going to die." There was a guy right above us on the second floor. His name was Thaad. Okay. And Thaad, thank God for Thaad, bro. Thaad comes downstairs, looks at me, and he goes, "Y'all boys messed up, huh?" And we go, "Yeah, dude." Like, "What the [ __ ] is going on? This whole neighborhood had like mobs of dudes on like corners. The project complex, which to be clear, today has now been demolished." Okay, at this time 12 years ago was not demolished. And long story short, a block over was the project complex. And this wasn't like a couple apartments, dude. This was like three to four city blocks of dudes wearing like white teas. Like, oh my god, it was so bad. How far is that from here? Five minutes. Five minutes. So, that's the thing. It's like we thought we were If you're Okay, listen. If you're ever going to move to Miami, super pro tip, never ever ever live west of of uh the highway. You always live east of the highway. The closer to the water you are, the better it is. Okay? But it's a very thin sliver of hood to great quality of life. Okay. So, we thought we were moving in downtown Miami cuz on the map, go back to the map. Show them show them on just like press the back button. Press the back button and you'll see on on the uh it's 8:30. Yeah. Look at the map now. Click on click on the map. And do you see this right here? So, as an example, like I live right now, like I don't know, five, six blocks east in a super [ __ ] sick penthouse. I can walk across the street and go to the the Heat Arena. Like, my quality of life's insane. Five blocks over from where I live. Five blocks west. Again, you could look at a map and argue like, "Oh, looks like you live in downtown." So, again, we didn't have money to come down here and see where we're moving. So, okay, long story short, this guy tells, this is like crazy [ __ ] The landlord tells he's like, "All right, just rent times two to move in." So, it's 1,800 bucks. And that was a lot for us back then. We pay the 1,800 bucks. We drive 33 hours. We pop some Rolin, which I don't encourage, by the way. Don't anybody take We pop rolin. We drive 33 hours from Denver, Colorado, all the way down to Miami. And we show up. We go a little bit further west near this place called Jackson Hospital where the landlord's like office was. And again, even Morehood. And this guy tries to [ __ ] us. He tries to tell us it was rent times three. Thank god we had in writing it was rent times too because we didn't have any money, dude. When we officially moved in after we got into this [ __ ] hole, we then drove to Walmart, which by the way, there's like one Walmart in Miami and it's even further west than that. We bought like beans and corn and like frozen chicken and [ __ ] Like we were poor, dude. We were poor. And it was devastating, dude. Like we had people that would We're on the first floor in that corner, like I said, so people would like slide up our uh bathroom window and like take our soaps and [ __ ] There were like all kinds of [ __ ] crazy bugs. I had those inwall AC units or two of them in the in the in the uh little apartment. This apartment, I don't remember the exact square footage. I don't make it up, but like without exaggeration, probably under 700 square feet. We had a couch in this living room and the the picture normal like two-seater love couch and you had roughly a foot and a half worth of space between the wall and the couch for your walking room from how small the living room was. We we both had air mattresses. We didn't have a TV and unfortunately like you know my buddy just wasn't really that ambitious unfortunately for for me and him you know like I ended up having to eventually pay like the full rent. He eventually like you know just wasn't a good buddy of mine eventually you know just kind of split up through time. But um anyway that's how I came down to Miami. Now I had sold phones in Costco when I very first got here. Sold. So I was I was that's what helped me transfer down with like an income was I had sold cell phones in like those little Costco booths that they have in there. If you've ever been to a Costco, they have like a little I think it's called wireless advocates is the name of the business. Okay. So, I was one of those guys that would stand in those booths and like just sell phones for the different services. I had transferred down here through that job and I had a I had a location in North Miami Beach that that was my that was my Costco. Okay. And I sold a phone to a guy one day, his name was Peter. Peter had a company and it was selling this like LED franchise opportunity to people at the time. like all the lights were old and none of them were like LED lights. And it was a pretty big energy savings opportunity when you could convert like a commercial building or a government uh like a city as an example to LED instead of whatever the old lights were called. And so he would sell like this very low ticket franchise opportunity to people. It's like $10,000. And Peter hired me when I sold him a phone. He was like I was I was 19 at the time. I I think actually maybe even late 18. And he goes, "You um you're young. Like you know what you're doing. like you'll I I I'll come in and interview dude he hired me as his head of marketing was my title and he he threw dude I was doing stealth seminar if you remember that I had to do SEO I had I actually spun up I had I had technically an agency back then because I had an SEO agency at the time through what I had learned at Peter's business I had ever I had to work with sales teams I had to learn to market like I was doing Facebook ads like way back then I had CRM with infusion soft experience And anyway, long story short, I don't I don't in any way, shape, or form like to trash Peter, okay? But I will say this, and this actually this actually exclusive to you, bro, right now, okay? I've never said this publicly before. It's actually a story that I'm comfortable telling now, so I'm far enough away from it. Okay? So, we hired these Russian web developers that I'm 90% sure Peter stiffed. Okay? I'm pretty sure that Peter stiffed them. And one day, some big [ __ ] dudes showed up to Peter's office and like went into his office. And then like a week later, Peter said he was shutting down the business. And I I correlate those two. You can you can conclude to what you want to conclude to happened. But moral of the story, you know, I made my conclusions about what I think happened. So I went on this I went on this website. It was fiverr.com. You remember Fiverr? And I hire a lady. She says she can type your resume up professionally and I just tell her all the things that I do. You had someone on Fiverr, dude. I I just dump all because keep in mind, dude, like I'm a [ __ ] young idiot. Like I don't know anything of this. I'm I'm living in this hoop marketing. Yeah. Like bro. Yeah. So, so I tell I really was the head of marketing. I learned like so much [ __ ] and I did help Peter make a fuckload of money. And anyway, long story short, I tell this lady on Fiverr. I'm like, "Look, here's all the things that I did." She turns it into like a really good resume. I put that resume on indeed.com. By the end of that week, I get a call. Not going to say from who. He doesn't like when I say his name to be clear, but I I get this opportunity from a sales trainer. It's very well known in the real estate space now. Guy's a billionaire. Hires me to be his first digital marketer. And this changed my life, man. Like, I wouldn't be nearly where I am today. I hon I honestly wish I could sit here and say his name as much I possibly could because wouldn't be even remotely close to where I am if it wasn't for that opportunity and I get hired in mainly because they needed help with infusionoft. Long story short, interesting. When is this? This is this is when I was 19. So this is so this was uh I'm 31 now. So I'm not sure the exact year. I'm I'm not good with year math but yeah me a good long time ago. No public math stolen. I think it was like 20 2014 time frame if I remember correctly but I I fair to be wrong. Moral of the story is I get hired in to be his head of not his head of marketing to be I got hired to be an email marketing manager originally and then I get I I was technically a temp because I got hired through this company called Robert Half and dude really funny story by the way total side note the day I showed up for my interview right I rented a suit and thank god I did because like that was definitely a necessity for that job I I sit across unknowingly you know who Dan Pena is dude I sit across from Dan Pñena in the lobby and I have no [ __ ] clue who anybody is I didn't know I didn't know any of these people. And I I look at Dan, he goes he goes, "What are you here for, young man?" And I go, "I'm here for an interview." I go, "Are you are you here for an interview?" And he goes he started laughing his ass off, bro. And he was like he's like he's like kind of yeah, kind of actually. Yeah. Cuz he was getting interviewed for one of the shows that they did on on the network that they have at the time. And uh anyway, I ended up telling their their COO who interviewed me. I was like, "Yeah, I was just talking to this nice older guy out there in the lobby." And she was like, "You talked to Dan B?" And I was like I was like, "Well, Yeah, I mean he asked me he asked me a question. Anyway, I so I got uh I was technically a temp for three months and then I get hired on as a I think they they titled me digital digital marketing specialist or digital marketing something and bro they were doing nothing. They were doing not a [ __ ] So it was like infusionoft like automations or it was like this was like everything dude plus automation. So to be fair to be fair they they had a whole it's kind of like an internal agency that they had they just didn't have a marketer. So they had I think it was one copywriter, uh, two graphic designers, two web developers, a videographer, and then me. And so I come in originally, and my job was pretty simple. It was like, look, we got like a couple hundred thousand leads in this CRM database. The salespeople are all just taking information and like looking on Google and cold calling people. They had they had inbound leads technically, but they would never dial in any of the inbound leads because they didn't know how to use their CRM. So they were taking these fully in infusionoft. They were taking these lead sheets and like uploading them into Infusionoft and then like they didn't know how to [ __ ] use it. So my job initially was like teach these people how to use infusionoft build a fuckload of marketing automation to support them. And because I had a full-time marketing job like dude I was building a fuckload of if this then that logic like my my automations ran so [ __ ] deep in that business and that was that was uh an incredibly revenue driven set of actions for them because again they had no dude they were doing at most a weekly newsletter. I think they called it the strategy of the week and that was the only thing they would blast out to the entire list and that was the only thing they had going out. I started developing like contextual marketing automation relative to where people were at in the sales process. Taught the sales people how to market different sales stages. I would build con contextual marketing automation from the individual sales rep that could get a response back to their inboxes. That alone like drove so much more [ __ ] revenue for these guys because it changed their world. Like instead of just cold calling businesses, they had like [ __ ] warm leads to actually call at that point. Are they already doing like catalogish? Like are they already doing are there multiple fronts at this point? And they're not This entire business, this entire business was at this point when I walked into it solely in outbound business that made a couple million dollars in contract value a month through outbound dialing. Wow. And I just started to propose a lot of the things that I had learned with Peter's organization where I was like like, "Dude, we could run ads." And they were like, "Okay, go ahead." And I would turn on some ads for different things like lead magnets and lead forms and like eventually we started doing webinars free and then paid webinars. Dude, even the paid webinars alone were so fun. We we would charge like 49 bucks for them and then we would sell an upsell of this um this university for $9.97 at the time. And I would never encourage you to do 997 price in today's day and age, by the way. That's like a scam price now. But at the time, it was like that was like the popping [ __ ] price. It's like you whatever you were selling should be 97 at that time, you know? So, we started doing like a couple million bucks a month. And we dude, we we had so many ecom products and like I I had simply put just any random idea that could drive revenue would just propose it and they would just be like, "Yeah, go ahead." So, I have a question about that. So on the marketing side, that's one thing and we even have that right now. How were and we don't have to go too deep into this exact uh specific example, but like how was the product generation side where they did they keep up with you guys? Because if you're spinning up lead magnet after lead magnet is like a marketing market I truly wish I could just like sit here and like say this guy's name because like it would immediately make so much sense. But like let me be super clear. We could never ever catch up. like this guy would walk in the room when we had a insanely large project already and he'd be like here's another project and I need it done by tomorrow and we would just [ __ ] we'd be like dude you have no idea what you're asking like that's insane and then he would be like oh [ __ ] like get it done like y'all can do it and then every single time to our surprise we would actually pull it off and every single time we would then be pushed even harder and I think this is a big part this is why I attest when I when I talk about the initiation of the story like this is genuinely Why I think everything's so easy nowadays because I without exaggeration I can operate at about half that capacity and still accomplish so much [ __ ] like infinite [ __ ] because of the level that I was pushed in that key like brain development phase of my life and like early adulthood. And on top of that, bro, like this guy's ingraining beliefs at the same time that are personal development mastery lessons that are just redefining potential every single [ __ ] day we operated. And everything we did was just a damn near immediate validation cycle. And and I can't stress it enough. Like I can't say enough good things about my time there and like their organization, like everything that they had going on. The this this only unfortunate thing. just I I had an income cap and that ultimately led me to start a cap on the model. I didn't have an opportunity to earn more money beyond what I was being paid um past a certain point. So like I had like a small bonus but like there was a limitation to how much could be paid out on that small bonus. And by the time I had turned like late 20, I had an opportunity presented to me through one of the sales people at that organization. Actually, it became a stipulation. One of the guys who wanted to close told the sales guy he was working with, like one of their top sales guys, he said, "If you want me to do this deal, you got to introduce me to the guy doing your emails." And so this one of these sales guys walks in and goes like, "Hey, man. This is like a stipulation for me to close this deal. Like, can you help this guy out?" And I was like, "Yeah, sure." And like I didn't necessarily know cuz again, I'm like [ __ ] 20 years old. I'm like a [ __ ] idiot. And uh he goes um you know, so I tell this guy like I go, "Look, listen, man. I'll just call you later. You know, I don't want to like respect to this person I'm working for. I don't want to talk to you on like company time. So, let me call you after I get off. And I call this guy. Bro, this guy pays me 12 grand. Sends me a check. Now, keep in mind at this point, believe it or not, I'm actually still in that hood place. I go cash the check. I walk around with a 12K loaf in my pocket. I've never felt more like the man of my life, Ryan. Dude, I'm I'm walking up to my fellow like people in that creative department. I'm telling them to poke it. I'm like like poke the loaf, dude. And I I felt I just felt so good. And on top of that, like I was immediately able to improve my life. Like with that 12K, I'd gone at the time rents were really low here in Miami. I I lived on a little island here called North Bay Village. I moved to a little island uh in the middle of of my like there's Miami and Miami Beach and in the middle there's these bridges and one of those bridges that connects has two little islands on it called North Bay Village. I move on the on the smaller one of those two. I I all of a sudden have like a literal 270 degree view of Miami. I'm living on the water. There's like a little boat club attached to this apartment. And I'm paying 1,600 a month. I get to move in there with a part of that money. And on top of that, I go buy an Infiniti G37. A little at the time, this is like a white two-door car with leather seats, bro. I've never felt more like the man of my life, dude. And I uh Anyway, I realized in that moment, this guy, this is the craziest part. The amount of work I did for the guy who paid me 12K to help him. He had a roofing business. He's actually still a client of ours today. He uh Yeah. This guy say the name of all day. He loves my season. His name's Lee Hate. And Lee's a roofer. He runs a he runs an amazing roofing business and Lee also has an education company that at the time he wanted to help get created and so I was able to help with his roofing business initially and I was able to help create his education company as well and and get that into the market. And long story short, the amount of work I did, excuse me, let's let's edit that part. The the amount of work I did for the guy that I was working with comparatively to the amount of work that I did for Lee was exponentially different. Okay, so moral of the story is I realized, okay, I'm making this guy who just paid me, Lee, I'm making Lee a fuckload of money with the things that I'm doing and they're honestly taking me like a couple hours a week. And comparatively, the main guy that I'm working with that again wouldn't be remotely close to where I am today if it wasn't for this opportunity. I end up being in this position with him where I'm like, okay, I'm now like capped on income and I'm working like, you know, [ __ ] 10 hours a day on this [ __ ] And I realized like, holy [ __ ] like I could probably start a marketing agency. And I didn't necessarily know what that meant. Like I didn't, again, I was pretty [ __ ] okay? Pretty dumb. I get to the point where I'm like, can I do this? Can I like pitch this and sell stuff? And keep in mind, I was working with a sales trainer. So, I felt very competent in my sales skills and I started applying them. So, I go out there and I just start pitching businesses. And this [ __ ] this shit's crazy, dude. Like, this is the kind of thing that you learned about in that first course you bought from me. I started pitching people. I started initially I was emailing and then I eventually found this thing called the video pitch. And through time, I evolved to the point where dude, I I did so good in my opinion. you know, I did $50,000 in the first 45 days. And I I was so like amazed with what was possible with this like agency model that I had like stumbled into. And at the time there was nothing. Like there wasn't like a Tai Lopez SMMA. There wasn't anybody [ __ ] teaching anything about this [ __ ] And I had no idea what it really was. I was just like, "Okay, I understand the concept of this. like I'm going to sell these like digital marketing services and I'm just my I understand my job my my I'm a result-based outcome of making people more money with the digital services I have. Moral of the story is I get to this point where I'm I'm dialing it up. By the time that you saw that course that you had purchased as an example, that was in late year two. I had already been doing a couple hundredk a month at that point. That's when Tai had come out with his SMMA program. Sold a good couple hundred thousand people into that thing. So that was crazy. That dude was insane. I I could talk to you off camera about like the specific numbers, but like it's truly like [ __ ] insane, dude. And anyway, long story short, I get to this point where I get the opportunity to teach in there and then I just start getting blown up by people and I'm like, "Bro, like the lessons have to be in what you just bought." And they were like, "No, they're not." And I love you as a teacher. Like, you you had the best one out of all of them is what I kept hearing. And I was like, "All right, sick. Like, I'll make something." So, in that office, I had three offices at the time. I had one in Miami, I had two in Beverly Hills. And anyway, I ended up teaching that first program, the DMM. That was my first education product. And then that entire time, dude, I mean, it's been over a decade now. Just been helping all kinds of people. A majority of them initially were in the info space. And then through time, we've just evolved to anything high ticket like product or service oriented. We've we've done I don't even know, dude. I'm not one of the guys that like makes up a crazy amount of money that they've spent on on ads because I got to keep it real. Like I have no idea, dude. It's so much money that we've made and so much money that we spent. And again, I started when I was 20, so like I wasn't sitting there just tracking it. Yeah. Um and I don't feel ethical just making up a number, but it's a [ __ ] lot. Okay. And we've done and seen every [ __ ] model. And that's what's so fun, you know? And and then we we meet cool people like you along the way, too, that are just doing other things and like, you know, a perfect example of that, dude. Like you started back then and look at you now, like couple million bucks a month. That's what it's all about. I think it's so cool what you can do, you know? Yeah. The I I don't know. I like to call it the info info/coaching, right? Infocoaching because so many people now in like the hybrid is either both of them or the ascension from one to the other. But I think like as the industry moves, but it's so funny. I talked to Josh Gavin about this all the time. He was like the first he's 22 or 23 like young kid and he's just like they don't know pure as pure as can be. And he lived in the nothing held back world, the Alen sultanic like all that. So he was big on copy, big on offer creation. Uh but he's seen all the models. So, it's the free webinars, the paid webinars, the low ticket, it's the high ticket direct. It's DTA versus VSSL opt. And like it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter which one it is. And like, oh, what's hot now? Like you see like all these guys who are kind of newer to the space are like, oh no, like right now it's webinars. And like, yes, again, agreed. Like there are waves of things that like hit better at different times. Yeah. Like, yeah, you and I were talking about that. But like doesn't mean you can't crank a VSSL optin funnel and do 15 million a month, you know? Like I still know people right now who do XYZ model and do 12 to 15 million a month. And it's like everyone's like, "Oh, it's webinars." Like they don't give up about a webinar. Yeah. So, like I don't know. But the info coaching as the delivery is either you're selling info or you're giving coaching or it's info with Mick Co. Like I love it. Everyone tries to leave and go private equity or go software or go do their thing or whatever. It's like I'm gonna hang out right here. You know, I'm going to hang out right here. I'll tell you this like when you ask that question, why Miami? Simply put, you know, that was the main reason to be fair was just I had a buddy who was like, "Dude, this place is proximity." And and through time, it's evolved in an even greater and greater city. And again, through time, I'm so impressed with with how much it's grown and how much it's developed and like how many people have moved here. But I will say like to your point, this is what gives the info space a bad stigma to a degree. It's like you have people who run like as an example, I consider myself one of these prime examples, a serious [ __ ] education company. Like we take it serious. We understand the game. We know what your outcome is. You want to spend whatever you're going to spend on that info, business, course, product, whatever it is. You obviously make a fuckload more than what you're going to invest. And we take that outcome extremely seriously around here. Okay. So, no matter which one of our products, we we give as much as we possibly can. We update it on an ongoing basis. And just due to the fact that we've been in that niche for so long and seen all the different models of delivery mechanisms for like how you could actually deliver one of those products, we understand what's enough and what's like considered more than enough for us to really overd deliver for somebody and stack the odds they get the outcome they're after. So we're really good at delivering results. But to be fair, I always make fun of these kids like these broccoli hair boys and their their goal is to like move down to Bickl, buy themselves like a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] like I don't know C8 on a hundred something month auto loan or something and they they all call their homes pen houses and like then people like me like dude I have like an actual [ __ ] penthouse you know and I have like actually [ __ ] sick cars and like you know I do all kinds of crazy [ __ ] but to be fair I also just living in Miami you know to be fair I I understand this the stigma of it. Give or take your your individual perception. Um that alone can can dictate whether you trust somebody or have like a lot of skepticism. I I fully get that. I teach it all the time. Character development has to do a lot with environment, what you're positioned with, who you align yourself with, things like that. But the point I'm trying to make is the people, you know, like you as an example, who have serious education businesses, that's completely different than somebody in my opinion that just like sells a [ __ ] course. Yeah. Completely. you know, this isn't like a side piece. This is something that although yes, to be fair, it makes a minority of my revenue currently relative to my marketing agency and what we do with profit shares, it's still something that we take extremely seriously. And I can't stress it enough. Like that's really what you got to keep your eye out on. Yeah. But a lot of people, they don't even have willingness to participate in like the info info business solely because there's this small demographic. Have you heard me ever talk about the propaganda spectrum? Uh yeah, but I think you should probably talk about it again. One of my favorite things is is when you look out there in the marketplace, like you could look at, as an example, like the president, right? Like if you look at Trump specifically, it's very easy to immediately conclude that there's people who are like diehard Trump supporters and there's people who absolutely [ __ ] hate Trump. Like even just saying the word might actually trigger an emotional response in some of the people sitting here watching this. But there's also this like middle ground of people that are relatively neutral. Now certain things have stronger and larger quantities of people that have the sold like I'm for this person and stronger and larger quantities of people who are against that person. It's like when you look at a president as an example, you could argue on the spectrum that the quantity of people that hate and the quantity of people that are sold are larger and the quantity of people that are in the middle are smaller. But for a lot of things, I'll give you a great one. This is one I've just randomly heard of. Just comes top of mind. Have you ever heard of the new restaurant? It's called Cababa. CA. So, I am I've never had an experience with this place. Are you sold that it's good? Are you sold that it's not good? Or are you currently in the middle and you're relatively unsold? I'm relatively unsold. I'm I'm unsold, too. I've I I've heard relatively good things. I honestly have no idea what the [ __ ] they even serve. Do you know what they serve? No. Okay. Again, I have no idea what they serve. You have no idea what they serve. We're in the middle, right? So, it's like we have an opportunity to technically be sold or to technically join the the the group of people that are unsold and just like, "No, I hate that shit." But we in that example like if you think of the spectrum there's a very small quantity of people that are sold and there's a very small quantity of people that are unsold and there's a by far and large quantity of people that remain in this position in the middle the unsold demographic. Now what sells that middle demographic? What do you mean what sells them? Like what sells them? What makes them lean one way or the other or what makes them stay in the middle? Education. Think about this. Information, experiences. Yeah. Like conversations. Like there's all kinds of individual things that make people become sold. Likely for you and I, we probably just need to go to this place. We're going to Kav. I don't even know if there's one here in Miami because that that's how unaware I am about. Do you know if there's one? Should we Door Dash Cava? I don't know if he knows. So it's like it's like the point I'm trying to make is like Yeah. I mean, we likely just need to have an experience with it. But what if we had somebody that sat there? What if there was enough propaganda that reached us? Like we don't even know what they sell, dude. What if they just had content reach us that looked like really good food and we were like, "Yeah, I've never been there, but that [ __ ] looks pretty [ __ ] good." You know? But my point being the the unsold demographic, especially when you compare it to the info demographic, I still think is by and far and large huge. I think it's I think it's super large. And I think there's a small percentage of people that are like, "Dude, personal development courses, mentors, books, events, you [ __ ] feed it to me, I'll I'll buy damn near or any of it. I I'll be a diehard personal development person for as long as I possibly can." And then there's the same demographic. Think about this. There's YouTube channels that exist that are solely dedicated to the hate of different info businesses. It's crazy. And think about this. This is important to understand. I want to be really clear when I say this. There are plenty of people, I am not in any way, shape, or form denying this, that absolutely deserve to be slandered because they don't run education businesses. They sell at course, okay? And they're they're just generally unethical people who, to be fair, absolutely do [ __ ] people. And some of them, to be fair, inside of that same niche that we participate in are actual scammers. But like you could argue that same thing about restaurants. You could argue that same thing about politicians. You could argue that same thing about cars. You could argue that same thing about anything really. But the point I'm attempting to make is with info, there's that same logic where there's this percentage of people on the other side of the spectrum that are like, I don't give a [ __ ] what you say about somebody and how miraculous the result was that they helped you generate or how good that course or product or invent or whatever it was that you bought was. Courses are a scam. Okay. But to be fair, the by and large farthest majority is the unsold middle. Okay? And the job of the education business is the inmarket demographic is that little sliver that's already sold and probable to buy or the part of the people that are in the unsold middle that are open to buy like you and I are we open to buying the Cava place. It's like I'd say so. If I saw one honestly just out of curiosity alone, I'd probably be like I've heard enough good things where I'd be like, "Hey, if I'm hungry, I'll [ __ ] swing in there, you know?" Sure. But that's my point is is like the unsold middle has people that are willing to like swing in. It has people that need convinced to swing in. It has people that even after they buy will stay in the unsold middle and be like, "Well, maybe I need another one to have a higher impact." But there's also people who buy that immediately swing to the other end of the spectrum. And I can't stress it enough. When you look at the infos space, you can't you can't get like this demoralized view that it's all just a bunch of people who think it's a [ __ ] dreadful industry to participate in. You have to remember that the impact that you have, like think about this, right? You help you help people lose weight, okay? And you specifically help women lose weight. What types of results and what types of emotional emotionally charged responses have you received from the customers that you've helped over the years? It's insane how much I was talking to I think I was talking to you about this, but like we at one point like the client wins channel just fires off. We have like an internal Slack channel. It's just like boom boom boom coaches CS whatever, right? The front of the company doesn't get to see that. We're like 140 something deep now. So sales front end of the team it's a little more difficult for them to see them. So like they we're constantly trying to push them to the front. Um, but we were doing such a good job at fulfilling on the contract that we weren't even focused on like the LTV game and like retention. So it was like what can we get them in this year because they signed up for a year versus like how do we position this so it's a two three lifelong approach and it is and but it was like almost I don't want to say too much education but there was a lot of education that was like cool after the first year like you got this on your own which you know you want the continued accountability you want the continued access you want that stuff but all to say insane I mean like we're not we're like the classic like the chart or the uh the scale like we don't do any of that because like you can weigh the exact same bleep yourself out from saying I I always bleed myself out. I always bleed myself out. Wow. Look at this guy. Classy. Classy. I go off. I'll literally. Yeah. But uh no, like literally it's uh for us it's much more around the empowerment. It's around there is an education, focus and and portion cuz like at some level we do I.e. we feel obligated to like provide that. Yes. But at the same time like those things that you get through personalization, community, accountability like that you can't get alone. That's the whole point of those, right? Think about this though. like the the level of result that you've gotten some of these women specifically that you've helped like have been genuinely life-changing for them. And I would also like to make it known. Yeah. Again, so like for context if someone doesn't know our thing and right it's like I I look at info coaching a lot of the time as the expert and the marketer, right? Is like kind of what you need to get to a couple hundredk to a million whatever. And then beyond that is kind of like expert, marketer, operator. Those are at least the roles. Doesn't necessarily have to be three people. Doesn't have to be two people. Could be one person. But like those are kind of like the core pieces. And we actually had those as three core people, right? So like I am co-owner, not co-founder. Very very clear here, right? Like they started this without me. It was a low ticket thing. That's tomorrow I'm going to talk about is like the quick little like journey of that, the quick little journey of the offers, the funnels, and then like how we got to here. But me coming in as operator in that like they already had product market fit, meaning they were already helping women directly. So like that's the core. We have the expert, the amazing brand face, the amazing co-founder who like has the connection with the women both on the emotional level and the physical result level and all those things. So like and now it's just been expanded throughout 70 plus coaches and like this whole thing. Right now it's a little under 70 coaches but heard more. So the results are insane. It's like think about this right if you if you didn't do that and if you didn't help people with those outcomes okay the world would genuinely be in a worse off place like those people could have to be fair pursued that result in other places. It's not like we're going to negate that from existing and having potential. Well, again, my point is imagine if if if people like you and I didn't exist. Like my job in my world, I help rich people get a fuckload richer because I believe in the power rich people. I believe in the responsibility we have. I understand the speed in which we can materialize life. I understand the amount of philanthropic help we can produce. I deeply believe in like the transformative outcomes especially in the info space that we help people produce. any good product and service, no matter what it is, generally get somebody a result and an outcome or through some type of problematic scenario or even if just sells them into something that they desire and that they want. That's what businesses are for. You know, one of my clients, her name's Cody Sanchez. She teaches people how to buy businesses. Yeah, Cody's awesome. She consumed tons of her content, dude. Love Cody. Just spoke at one of her events, I think last week or the week prior. She's got to come on here. We got to do this. Yeah. Cody, dude, I'll I'll happily make and facilitate an introduction with you and Cody. you guys would get along great. Cody has this statistic that she talks about where she says currently in modern day 6% of us here in America are business owners. She said back in the Wild West it was 84% of people were business owners. And a lot of the people out there have fallen victim to like I'm just going to work a job. And to be fair, it's like that's okay. It's a crazy stat. I know it's a huge difference and a huge swing. But like I again when when you hear stuff like that, I think to myself, I'm like I love what we do with our info businesses, you know, that that that small percentage of people, right? It's like, bro, no offense is probably why you don't say bad words. Maybe you have some other reasons could be religious for all I know. I swear all the time [ __ ] YouTube comments, bro. I bet those I bet you saw maybe one or two YouTube comments from one of those [ __ ] that's in that small sliver that's like, "Oh, I can't even listen to this [ __ ] cuz you say so many bad words." It's like again, you can't you can't define your life by that tiny little tiny non-stop all the time in chats in everything. You're not even willing to be yourself. I'm I'm my fullest [ __ ] self when I'm making content. Like I This is how I am all the time. Okay. The first time I've sat in a chair that swivels, that's for sure. It feels good. Ever. Yeah. No, but my my here's my point, okay? Info is arguably one of the most transformative high responsibility businesses that exists when you take it seriously. And the outcomes that we produce are transformative. Okay? And when you look at that unsold middle, it's like I'm not saying we need to convert the earth on our offers, okay? That's not what I'm sitting here yapping about. What I'm saying is is like when you look at the propaganda spectrum and you say, "Okay, well, a lot of these people, they might not even know that they need the help." Like, bro, if you would have told poor me that there were people like me now that exist that I could watch on platforms like YouTube and hear that exact type of story from and see like, so you're telling me that guy went from the hood to a building that didn't even exist when he first moved here and now lives at the literal top of it and and like has this crazy [ __ ] life and does all these all like helps so many [ __ ] people, dude. It's like that's what I that's what that's the importance of an info business is. It's a It's not necessarily to take people in that position to an even better position. It's just you take people from where they're at, no matter where they're at, relative to who you sell to, and make tremendous [ __ ] change in their life through all these things that we talk about, which I'm happy to transition into, by the way, frontend [ __ ] like we can sit here and yap about webinars, challenge funnels, low ticket to high ticket call. Let's get tactical in a minute. But that's the thing, you know. Yeah. What you were saying though about the I think that's the other piece of this because like the whole it's a scam industry. You saw the infomercial guys, the real estate guys used to sell stuff for 50gs. That was like an info coaching thing and like back then they were called scammers. But now it is so widely known like you said like oh I didn't even know to go on YouTube and watch these. Like it wasn't as prevalent like at all. Like it didn't even [ __ ] clue the guy that I worked for existed until I started working with him. And and to your point, I saw thousands of every single morning that guy did a morning meeting and we would openly read out dozens of testimonials from just the previous day that poured in and I was like, who in the [ __ ] is this guy? Like we're helping the world and like I've never even heard of this dude until I started working for him. Like we got to make this guy known, you know? Well, now though, so it's so easy to make to be an info like in info coaching as someone who sells something which is danger, right? And then it's also so easy to post on XYZ thing and like launch something. I was literally I was at the uh hotel sitting in the lobby right before I came here. Got a little cheese board, got my sparkling water, was posted and I open up YouTube and it's three guys sitting on a couch talking about info and like I've heard of like two one of them mainly saw the other two they're talking someone's doing 300 grand a month. This guy's talking about doing five or six hundred grand a month and like young dudes crushing it. Like all the power to him love it honestly. Like just so interesting like I haven't heard of any of these guys. I start to go down the rabbit hole real quick on like X and clicking on stuff and I'm like oh and this guy and this guy and this guy and everyone in the bios are like 500k like 1.2 uh 1.7K it's like all of them and they all either live here or like a Scottsdale or somewhere and I'm like oh it's just so interesting because all of them generally they were all talking about selling like a version of the same thing or they're there's the info growth operator model now. So it's like all of these additions to this it's just like feels like it's like wildfire how it's spreading. Yeah. And there can only be only so much cream can rise to the top based on intent, you know, because it's like I want to be really clear when I say this, okay? I'm I'm always super transparent about this. I abs fuckingutely love money. Okay? I implore you to pay me money so I can help turn that money into more money for you. Okay? My favorite thing on earth is getting richer. Okay? Because when I get richer, I'm getting other people richer. But I take like my intent, okay, when I help people through my info business is well, I understand the game and I play it extremely [ __ ] well and I play it seriously, okay? We don't just take your money like some [ __ ] and just go buy dumb [ __ ] and just say, "Haha, like you got [ __ ] scammed." It's like, "No, dude. We play the game exactly how it needs to be played. We get the money. We call it the you're [ __ ] me spectrum. Okay. So immediately when somebody pays us, we're technically [ __ ] them. And for that short window of time, our sole responsibility is to flip it to them [ __ ] us. We want like I'll give you a perfect example. I think I brought this up last time. I had a guy, he joined in, paid 5K a month. 5K a month is 60K a year. Okay? In the first couple days of him being in there, he goes in, starts learning about those back-end selling systems we were talking about on the on the part one of this whole thing and improves his show rate upwards of 40%. Dude made 178 grand in a week. That's the you're [ __ ] me spectrum. In in in weeks, that guy paid for the entire year within just a 40% improvement in his show rate specifically. It's like I've had other people join in that are like, "Oh, my cost per call was 200 bucks. I drove it down in under a hundred bucks that resulted in x amount of revenue that it produced. It's like whether it takes a couple weeks, which generally to be fair is relatively unrealistic most of the time. That's why we tell people they need to be in there for a year. It could take a couple months relative to their speed of problem solving and also the money. Like a guy like you that makes several million dollars for me to help you lift 10%. You're again, you [ __ ] me extremely quickly compared like if I get a guy if I get a guy joins in there at like the bare [ __ ] minimum of making 100k a month. Okay? And I got to get that guy 10%. But think about it. 10% of 100K is still 10K extra a month. He's paying me five. He still [ __ ] me extremely quickly. But again, the point I'm trying to make is really clear. We focus on the you're [ __ ] me spectrum. We immediately know we're technically [ __ ] you until we return your cash and then from there you're [ __ ] us. And because of how fast we can tilt that spectrum and how good we are at that specific game, I believe that the transparency of listen, we love your money. We don't virtue signal about the fact that we don't love your money. We absolutely do. But the main thing, and I can't stress this enough from like a missiondriven view, is I want there to be so many more rich people than there are right now on earth. And I want to have a huge part. I want to have a big role in that. I want to help make as many people as I can and and without just driving myself into the ground. I don't want to do it with a high level of stress. I don't want to burn myself out, but I will contribute as much as I [ __ ] can to get as many people as I can, as rich as I possibly can because I came from that impoverished position. And I don't just want to get people rich. I want to get them super [ __ ] rich because, dude, the power of just the speed in which we can materialize a better earth and like change everything for the better. And and you I see it time and time and time and time again. And the thing is, when you only get rich, you typically only buy the stupid [ __ ] and you only have enough to be selfish. Yeah. But when you get really [ __ ] rich, you get philanthropic cuz you start to realize like, well, I've already checked all the boxes. I call it summiting. Okay. I believe that the the mountain that we climb of success has multiple moments where you've kind of got to chill for a minute and be like, "All right, the first thing I bought as an example when I initially got to the So, first thing, very first thing, the car, the Infinity G37. That was the first summit. The second summit was I'm going to go buy a new little place to live. The third summit was I went to this place called Y3 and I bought a whole [ __ ] closet worth of clothes day in and day out as I continue to close more deals. As at that point, it's like I felt better and better. From there, it's like why I eventually started to split live between LA and Miami. That felt cool, too. Then I got a bunch of cars. Then I got nicer cars. Then I got better places to live. And at a certain point, you just look at your life and you're just like, well, all that shit's out of the way. like what do I got to do now? And and you start to become philanthropic and high impact and you become the ultimate gambler. You you you're willing to take risks to turn money into so much more money. And then the the what you do with the [ __ ] money. Anyway, point I'm trying to make is so clear. When you have an info business and you only do it for money and you sell a course just because you see some other guy making some money with a course, that is one of the illst intents unless you have like something coupled with it that you feel like genuine about. Like if if you look at the lives that you change and you don't feel like that's a part of why you're doing it, if you don't look at the things that you get to go help people do through the ripple effect of helping those other people get richer. I think that's where a lot of the people go wrong in info and why they're interpreted as a scam or why they're interpreted as low trust because it's it's transparent based on intention. Yeah. You know, you can tell when somebody genuinely gives a [ __ ] about you. Yeah. And you can tell when somebody's just like, I just want a couple bucks to be able to go buy a [ __ ] Huracan and live in Bickl and say it's a pee house. You know what I mean? When I was saying that, I was watching that video earlier. Like I respect those those kids. I mean, I'm going to call them kids because younger than me, but like I it's they I was listening to how they were talking about things and like I can learn a lot more, right? I can learn a lot more. I learn things when I hear you talk. I learned things like we're going to talk about next. Like I learned things in all these things and I try and pull them out and I was literally just listening and I was like this so interesting some of the things they were saying about how they viewed it that again cream rises to the top and like some of these kids you can see you can just see it in whether it's info right now and something else later where it's like continue to go up like you can go infinitely high in info like very very high. You can exit velocity is what I always say like when you get out of there and that's where I want to take this next though with you because it's like what is next in that you want to help all these people get infinitely rich you want to do that cool you get your percent of their do you want to build one do you want to be a bigger part of one of these that goes to like the hundreds and hundreds you've also talked and I want to pick your brain on this you said you've had multiple people that have exited uh that you know that are in that world which is in my land of what I'm trying to understand and learn and I kind of have some like context around it but not a ton. I'm building in a direction of doing it kind of blind and like what I think are the check intention or some kind of outcome on the other side of exiting. A lot of the people exit feel purposeless after and there's certain things that people can do with like playing a bigger game after they exit. And that's that's really the whole point of why I think you should exit is like I need a thick [ __ ] lumpsum to go play a bigger game. Otherwise the cash flow I think cash flow is far better than what a huge lump sum can do relative relative to the size of the lumpsum to be. Yeah. I was going to say no and I'll talk to you offline because like again ours is ours is partners right like again I was the third partner that came into this right um and you know percentages and things have bounced and round and like you know it's where value is going and all that right but one it's just like the check the box like it's just that like that what do they call it like completing the entrepreneur circle or the loop or whatever where it's like you build it you grow it and I honestly would categorize myself not directly as an entrepreneur in terms of I have I've never done the zero to one like I'm like when I like I watch Cody stuff because I'm like oh that's my speed I watch like by beset like those guys and uh quiet and all that because I think that if I find something product market fit I can scale the [ __ ] out of it once it exists but completing that loop getting it to a point where it's a machine it actually can sell and it can like really sell not like oh I hand it away basically and just get half a year's of cash flow like no no no I mean like I'm talking five eight 10 years of cash upfront and then it's nice too because again with partners and stuff you know you see the big numbers and I I made a video on this that's like cool we just crossed 80 and it's like 80 is here, what's margin on that? What's then split across, you know, partners, then what's split then where you live in your tax zones and how you live and all your stuff and you break it down, it's like guys, it's not like that. Like it's not like that. Um, so a cool liquidity event that's five, eight, 10 years of that, especially if we're going like this would be sick. Oh yeah. And I want to talk to you offline about some of the stuff because we have conversations of how we're going to hit exit velocity within info coaching, but the info coaching guys that have sold Yeah. I heard a 20 mil number. The the one that I know I talked to William Brown on his and he has kind of a unique setup of how he did his and it was like a million and I think it was a million and a half rangeish. Um but he sold that had some like seller note on there with some interest on it. Uh he had a six-month or year-long it's in the video so you guys can watch that and find out. But he talks about his deal and then you have the Hormosi deal that's obviously very public when he talked about his which was 40 50 somewhere in that range when he sold gym launch with the grouping of the other things. So was his a full exit to my understanding? No, I'm not I'm not a pro on any of these guys. We We had a guy that did a a minority exit for 40 mil. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. And I I was going to say like Yeah. Oh, yeah. All info. Yeah. transactional offer. It wasn't even recurring. How does that make sense? Well, it makes total. Dude, the guy spent 1.8 mil, did $22 million over like 19 months, and then the guy came in and was like, I'll give you 40 mil for a minority stake of that. And it had it had some like big backend piece or something that No, it was actually really interesting. A lot of these guys that we've seen so far, we've seen it four different times now. The people who buy them out are like, I'll give you a great example. We had one guy in particular, he was an executive of a big tech company and he had like branched out into private equity and he had bought one of these guys. That one got ran into Most of these guys have no idea what the [ __ ] they're doing. Yeah, I watched your video on that. They they wants to get into info and like they think it's a [ __ ] pipe dream and it's like honestly they probably look at it and just think to themselves like, "Oh, this is a this is a [ __ ] cakewalk. like, "Let me just run into this and I'll be able to scale the [ __ ] out of it." And a lot of them come in and do some of the dumbest [ __ ] you'd ever think of. Like things things that you and I would be like, why in the world would you even think that that's good to do? But they they don't know better. And so these businesses that they spend tens of millions of dollars on for a stake of, they take them over to a degree and like have a lot of influence in what happens next and they just run it straight into the ground. And two out of four of those instances, we've seen them give back the equity to the person they bought it from. And it was one of those situations where it's like, oh, you you get a liquidity event, then you end up getting the equity back and and then those one out of the two of those deals didn't end up getting the business back up. And then the other one of the two ended up getting it back up to 2 mil a month. And and it's awesome. He's uh yeah, he's great. Yeah. Moral of the story is you can exit from info. It just depends on who's buying you and what the intent is of buying you. Some buy it for the cash flow. Some buy it to like roll you into something greater. Some buy it because they look at your model and they think you're an idiot and they're like, "Oh, this person's not doing this with it and this would make a lot of sense." And yeah, yeah, four. Four. They're 0 for four. I'll tell you that. They're over for four on whatever they thought. It's not good. It's not good. I need some track record so people are willing to But the people who ran it, you know, the people who ran it like they they obviously had a great time because they got these liquidity events and like they typically do well after so they don't end up getting [ __ ] But yeah, anyway, moral of the story is I've seen it. I've seen it a few times. Um, and it just depends like to your point, everybody has individual summits like what I was talking about with like a clothes and a new place and then some cars and then investing and then like taking care of your mom or like getting a mortgage taken care of or whatever it is that's that's your individual it's your individual mountain. So like if you believe that you need a liquidity event in your lifetime to complete the entrepreneurial quest and start doing side quests from there or or the next larger quest, then it is what it is. Everybody's got their own individual journeys, but yeah, it's definitely it's definitely possible. It's definitely feasible and we've seen it many times over. Yeah. Yeah. I mean our I just kind of followed the hormone was the first one to talk about it in my realm of it right like I knew the understanding private equity kind of or like it exists and how it works at some level but not within this space and then when he started talking about it he made that big board that was like the different pieces you need it's like you need you know audited financials you need like diversification of faces you need diversification of uh you know uh acquisition basic basically you need to be out of the product all that stuff and we're like okay cool we'll just like work through a version of this checklist and real quick we're like nah we're not doing this we're just going to be cash flow is and then it like accidentally happened because of how we changed offers and I'm going to talk about that tomorrow when but like when we changed from info to coaching it broke the entire the math broke. Yeah. Because the cost to fulfill as a function of it while also ramping into it was increasing the cost to acquire. Yeah. At the same time. So, we were getting pinched without like directly knowing it because we weren't tracking it like well enough. And we just we was making 30 40 points and we were doing 10 million bucks a year and we were like 10 to 12 million at selling info and we're like who gives a [ __ ] All paid. We're like who gives a [ __ ] Like let's just rip it. We were selling $500 things over the phone like at one point because the math worked out. Like it was all good. And then we moved over to selling high ticket. The math was there. Cash flow was there. But cash flow was there as cash, not as acrruel because you got to pay your coach out in the f right. Like high ticket's way better than $500 phone sales though. Yeah. But even then though, even then though, like again, you're paying a coach out for the year. We didn't know how to do comp models. Then all of a sudden, you're growing. It's going up into this direction. You hear one person say, "Everyone needs to be W2." You swap your whole team to W2. So then you add 20% to your entire payroll costs. Now you got an HR manager. You got this, this, this. And CPA is going like this. You're paying an agency 130 grand a month to manage spend while CPA is rising. So I got those double whammies. And I got everyone W2. Calendars are half full still while CPA is rising. I'm like, it was everything that could go wrong was going wrong. So, we're like, those are some of the most brutal characteristics you articulated about businesses that typically hit million-dollar months. It's like they end up being in these positions where they become bureaucratic, political, slow. They they unknowingly transition thinking they're doing the right things into these just turtle businesses that have nothing more than the historical success they've had to hope and pray and stay latched on to somehow resurrecting and like entering back into the glory days. But it requires, you know, undoing a lot of those violently bad decisions. And most of the time, lean small teams have way more effectiveness. Like concentrated a player talent with lean organizations can typically achieve far more than what the larger organizations do. So when you talk about from like a cash flow versus like super divested, you're completely out of it type business. You could take that type of advice and you could you could do really really stupid things with that type of advice. You know, you got to be careful. Lean lean teams. I like it. I mean way better. Yeah, I talked to I'm in uh Iman. So Iman just rebranded over to consulting, right? So consulting.com. So he's got by the way, let's just shout out that real quick. That is super cool. Big dog. I love I love the consulting.com acquisition with the little uh the little photo on it and then the dude the traffic and funnels acquisition and the pony up and got them both. [ __ ] is super petty and super hilarious. I absolutely love it. It's so cool. Yeah. So he's got um so so right. So you've got inner circle, you've got your it like leans really in this and you can correct me but like in the paid world like you're marketer by at heart, right? So you have that like core piece and all the sales system and all the other pieces and like you got those guys in that room. His is and I just went to London for that. Uh it was called AFL now he he called it quantum. So now it's quantum which is the OG consulting mastermind name. So he's got quantum master right inside there. But uh I went out there all those guys are including Iman right and then that's the audience he fosters same as you right but is like very organic they're running 80% margins they've got worldwide talent they've got like this playbook down that's in like just so different than my frame of like oh what do you mean you don't spend a million and a half you know to acquire all they're like why would we touch ads right now and now of course and again pendulum pendulum they'll go in this world but they do these live revenue generating events and then they'll do you know 10 million in profit on one of these and and they'll kind of chill and they just have this lean team of worldwide talent that's like this and I'm like gosh that's just is such a different model than we run cuz ours is W2 it's like how do we build this to sell it how do we have all basically all US workforce how do we like all of these things and each one of them is like a thousand little cuts and then point about being rich I mean it's not game of either or you know like being rich you get to you get to live a life of both I'm sitting out there on my sixth cigar yeah I'm on my sixth cigar it's like 3:30 in the morning and I'm sitting with Iman and like four or five other guys that were still awake and we're talking about the different models and someone's like yeah and you could do this or this or this or this and he's like yeah no like no like he's just like he's like I just I'm going to run this gambit and then he's got his million other things he runs and then he's talking to me and descend master guys and they're talking about like oh with the paid and because they run a very similar model to us and it was just exactly what you said. It was like we're we're running we are running our gambit they're he's running his and it's like cool they both work. You said you said what what were those guys names? the the guy that you're in the race with currently. Oh, okay. We're going to public We're going to public public this. Well, I mean, if you want I don't know if you want to get So, we are doing we are doing No, no, we posted it. Yeah, we posted it. No, we have a It was that night. Post about it at night. It was like 3:00 a.m. and we're sitting out there and they're like, "Yeah, first one to 5 million a month." And we're like, "All right, we need some stipulations." Oh, you did it at that. Oh, yeah. While we were there, we at London. We were at consulting.com events in London. Um and uh they were like, "First two, five million a month." And we're like, "Wait a minute." Because you can have some like crazy ramp. And we're like two months back toback 5 million a month cash collected minimum 15% margin and first one to do it and we're all like you know just yapping and it's like uh two Daytonas because it was me and uh Luke so co-founder and me and then there are two of them. Yeah. So it's like two pandas basically or two Daytonas around 30 and then if they if someone wants to spread it's like throw someone five or 10. We'll figure it out. Makes sense. Well dude I'll tell you I'll tell you live on your own channel they're going to beat your ass cuz they're in the inner circle. And dude, I will I will personally ensure that they have all justifications and excuses removed. Oh, there we go. Yeah, at least remove those mean that five mil a month for two solid months in a row as you say, you know, and and what's the bet? How much I'll pay 10 grand a month to kick them out. Well, I'll tell you what, that's not worth it relative to the story that they'll achieve from being a victor there. And you know what their victor story right now is? Give them a five mil a month trophy, too. and I'll I'll make sure that you're there for that one and I'll hand Perfect. That'd be amazing. I would love that. Yeah. Well, guess what? They have market. They have the market. Uhhuh. So, they have crypto at all times, too. There's more women in competition. No, no, no. They have they have like the they have the market right now with uh crypto alltime high yesterday, right? So, they get the influx of that. They have the AOV. Theirs is three times what ours is, like front end cash. They have retention way crazier because it's true community based. Like, they've got a good model. interesting mental frame you're articulating selling against your own self. It's not selling against myself. It's we talked about the hedge. So like ours right now we're at two one or 22 and it's like 10 days into the month. I mean Ryan the the number industry that I think has existed for like dam time is women's weight loss arguably you could you could sell you and what you have potential and the friends we have that do over 10 a month are in health space not specific to women but like do that like the game the game is there. The game is there. We're ahead on cash. But I'm just saying they have more potential, you know, and we're closer on cash, but they have a great market and for them, I bet it could be a flip of switch. And they're like, "Oh, no. It'll be September. It'll be September." I'm like, "We'll see. We'll see." So, we're all just playing. We're all just playing. But this could be the first month we could get close. Well, boys, book those one-on-one calls with me since Don't book anything. I'm going to pay them to make it so you can't hopefully they show up to the mastermind tomorrow and I No, they 100% not. They just canceled their trip to like St. Trope or somewhere so they could lock in. It just sounds good. That's exactly what they should be doing, right? Giza. I actually had a guy, he was um he's one of my favorite deals that we've done. His name is Mark. And Mark has easily top three most dialedin people I've ever met. And he was supposed to come and chat with me tomorrow morning during the uh the opening talk that I have. You better pop a zen. But he usually he's heard I was going to help take a direct competitor. He's in five mil a month. goes and gets this in. Anyway, long story short, um Mark is one of the most dialed in people that that I've ever met. Okay? And he hits me up yesterday morning and he goes, "I had to fire a few of my salespeople. I'm not going to be able to make it because I now have to take those sales calls." And I'm like, "Mark, you're doing $3 million a month. U no offense. Why don't you just give them to some of the other sales guys?" and he goes, "I'm going to close those people for more money than what those salespeople ever would have closed them for. And I'm trying to hit this larger target and that's what it's going to take and that's what I'm going to do. And I'm just going to be full of anxiety if I come there. I'm not going to be my my best self. If you want me to talk to these people and, you know, explain anything, he's like, for me to be my best self, I need to be in a good place. And right now, I don't feel like I'm in a good place. I've got to take these calls. I respect it. And that's exactly what I said. I go I go, you know, I've had that where I've had a handful of trips that I've like had planned, paid out, ready to go on, and then, you know, the moments of like, okay, it's time to go. I'm like, you know, I just got a bunch of other [ __ ] I got to do right now. And if I go, I'm not going to enjoy it at all. I'm just going to be full of a lot of anxiousness as I as I travel to this whatever it is. And the point I'm attempting to make is like I was really I was really excited to be able to introduce you to this guy tomorrow morning and and have you meet him because I feel like to your point he might have been able to help supercharge that 5 mil a month number. He was he was one of the guys who exited for the 40 mil. Yeah. And for the for the minority stake. But that's a perfect characteristic when you look at it. When you when you talk about like what makes it work, whether it's organic, whether it's paid, whether it's through a webinar, whether it's through a call funnel, whether it's through low ticket, whether it's through all of it, no matter what you choose to do, one of the worst possible things that you can fall victim to are the justifications and excuses that prevent speed of execution. It's all about being able to open and close those cycles of growth at a high rate of speed and being able to stay locked the [ __ ] into that mentality. You know what I mean? Yeah. So, I have that is right now the two biggest levers are just like CPA, plain and simple, and team efficiency. So, I have a new hire that starts on Wednesday and I literally marked the like no new hires until 5 million a month. Like, uh-uh, we're done. Like overhead, you stop. No MS except on coaching and sales because I feel like those can l you know those those have to kind sometimes go for volume. Makes sense. Project manager coming from a company with 140 team 40 million in rev. I'm like no more timelines of hey Thursday next meeting's on Tuesday we'll have it by Tuesday. It's like same day or Friday. Like we are collapsing time from now on. We have sickos. We have the craziest coolest team. We have like these C the seauite heads are all coming from now places that have done more except one that's like you couldn't hire better because she's come through the company like Siko but we just need the efficiencies on execution on time and like if we can follow through on that. So she's my direct report and then we'll shadow me with all of them. She's like yeah we'll have a like a whip meeting every week. I'll give you all the projects where they're breaking down all like boom boom boom. She's going to meet with all the seauite and then in all their department meetings I just set up cadence across every department like marketing huddle every day uh CS huddle every day. tech huddle every day. I'm like, "You guys are meeting every day. I'm optional on all of them. Pop in, pop in, pop in, and she's gonna be with me." I'm like, "Full execution." What are you doing for the charismatic leader meetings? Which one? Like, how are you in your remote organization currently projecting the necessary beliefs and way to think across these people in your organization companywide? How are you how are you doing? So, our cadence right now, so we L Luke and I Luke co-founder and like CEO. So we were like sitting like this for a long time and it was kind of awkward. We've like slowly kind of assembled this seauite and now we've directly hired in seauite that so we have chief of sales, we have a chief of marketing, we have a chief of people product that's the kind of funky one that we probably need to break out because she handles like she was a coach then led all the coaches then like all people things co and kind of bounced around but she is the one if you were to pick somebody in the company that's like thoroughbred through and through culture internal and could be external, right? She completely owns basically the culture internal. So she leads all hands and she's across that department, meets with everyone. She's like the one person everyone would go to for a onetoone, right? So like on the people standpoint. Um we do an ops cross sync on Tuesdays that is all the seuite and then I facilitate that. And then we do Thursdays that are me, Luke, and then the uh specific department. So it'll be like tech, just me and them back and forth, then fulfillment, then sales, then marketing. and we'll go and then each of them then have their department breakouts and we'll pop in those randomly but those are jazzed up dude where's where's just the companywide where you just the all hands is the first Tuesday of every month and that is 15 one a month let me tell you a quick story so like I said that that second marketing job I had under the sales under the sales trainer real estate guy I still to this day think one of the most effective things that helped drive culture in that guy's organization culture is not like some cheesy [ __ ] where culture is just a a shared collective of beliefs that that help drive act because beliefs drive behavior and actions. Okay? So the point of culture is just to shape a collective view that you guys share like a a shared worldview and a shared set of beliefs every morning at 9:00 a.m. Okay. At a morning meeting and the morning meeting would start by sharing a fuckload of testimonials and results that had happened just the day prior. This guy had a lot of material. It was to a degree kind of cultish with how awesome this was. It was in a good way, not a bad way. Would take like a book or a video or a training video or something and like read a little excerpt of it or like share a clip of it. Everybody would share their individual department stats. They'd collectively like just ensure the direction of the company relative to the current goals or intentions. And then this guy, the guy who ran this organization would do like this the super most genuine like riled up you could possibly [ __ ] get like motivation talks where this dude would just get in front of everybody and just be like okay like and he'd share a specific worldview or share a specific belief that by the time that like 30-ish minute morning meeting would end, you would leave the [ __ ] morning meeting, you'd be like, "Yes, like I understand the mission. I'm plucked in. Like I'm ready to go." And then throughout the day, to your point, with all these other random meetings, like all those other random meetings are where like he would physically pop into like the department and he would tell you like like you'd be kind of like demoralized like, "Oh my god, like this guy just gave us another [ __ ] crazy whirlwind of a project." And then he would tell you he'd be like, "Dude, I'm going to give you more too and you can [ __ ] do it." You know, like get this [ __ ] done like you just did it, you know? and like positive reinforcement consistently and you know any and all the training that you needed and like constantly having these really motivational and enthusiastic characters come in and help and hold you accountable as well. And I can't stress it enough the shared like dude if you're only doing that once a month I think it's a huge disadvantage because it slows everything down like you have to be you have to understand the power of the charismatic leader Ryan think about this like you're doing it more on YouTube right now with the daily videos You have you got to click on hear me out. It's like this is this is the daily videos. It's like why not why not have this internally in your click on the bottom right one the bottom right our our funnel booked. Actually that's not a good one. Sorry. Um yeah go the most recent one. I'm done making daily videos which is hilarious. By the way this is yesterday. Oh we're gonna get Oh here we go. This is this is like meta. This is like a double ad placement. All right. And then just go like 20 seconds in with no audio right there. Pause. Please. All I share in this in everything is what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing. Jeremy will tell me something and I'm directly going to change it. None of this is ever meant to be like, oh, this is the way. And that is what that I totally want to make this so clear. Like I'm like, oh, we do it like this and we run this cadence and this is how everyone should run their cadence and all this. Eh, eh eh. like this is an iteration that changed a month ago and changed three months ago and changed a year ago. These meetings didn't even exist. So like you sharing that and me being like, "Oh, that's interesting." I was at Iman's event. They talk about their entire first day was how they run their team and culture. And everyone was like, "Oh, oh." And he kept saying, he was like, "You guys don't get it. You guys like aren't getting it." Like you're like, "Oh, cool. This is how we do our Slack communication or this is how we have our cadence." And you guys are like think like, "Where's the tactical [ __ ] Where's the tactical shit?" It's like, "No, no, no. The reason we can weather every storm, the reason we're nine years profitable more and more and more every year is because of the culture and how we do things. The charismatic leader and the charismatic leader, which is Iman, right? Exactly. And like what he again, not to like, you know, hype hype hype, but his version of that was then we changed how we did ours. We're like, wait, we more standups. We had one marketing meeting a week that was happening. Sales was the only one that was doing a daily huddle, five days a week. That was it. And we're like, wait a minute, wait a minute. We have an entire remote organization like one just efficiency wise and like output of team. There's no way that the collaboration or the time to complete projects is happening at the level it could if we just met daily like just that alone. So Iman's example is they're like oh we do this like team uh basically one his seuite meets every day they have this like thing and then they breaks out into like a teamwide one that then has breakout rooms all connected to it. So it's everyone and then it's like sales a boom boom boom boom and they like crank through it and they break out and it's like people make a [ __ ] I'm never surprised to hear that they have again like a daily charismatic leader in front of the whole organization. Dude, he's got Yeah. Now, again, not to like hype, but like from there, I learned that piece and I'm like, "Okay, interesting." Now, what you're saying here is I'm like, "Okay, I don't I'm not that person. Let's be very clear, too. I'm I'm the data driven like here's this and this." Everyone's like, "Wait, can we do it?" And they'll like ask me like, "Is the math good or like can we sell it for this or can we whatever." And like decision-wise, but not like necessarily Ryan's like, you know, holding the torch by any means. Like, we have other very core people in the company who do that. So, I'm trying to think in my head as you say that like who would be the person that could lead that every day? And it's likely that chief of people person like cuz she has it right. This has to be important to understand. It's like charismatic leaders. They're highly believable individuals that when they articulate a message, right? It's a shared belief that they're attempting for you to inherit. And they're sharing data. Storytelling is really strong in these people. And what they're attempting to do is just keep you aligned to the main intention to the priority outcome of the organization. And they do so through positive reinforcement storytelling again and again and again and day in and day out. It's a highly believable character that when you put them in front of your people, they say to themselves like, "I'm really grateful that I'm working a part of this organization for the mission we're currently helping with. And I'm really grateful that I'm here with these people that I'm working alongside of that are also these missionoriented individuals. And I'm here for these specific outcomes that we're helping the world with. and they and they it's I can't express it enough. It has to be a person that isn't a a embraced as like, okay, this person's full of [ __ ] and this like some weird corporate tactic. It has to be genuine. Yeah. Has to be something that that actually believes in what you're attempting to achieve and it's just constantly reiterating that to the people. Do you do anything with the WAP guys? On and off. Yeah, the WAP guys gave me a cool samurai sword that's black obsidian. Shout out to There's a whole bunch of them. As a matter of fact, I communicate with you. I would like a samurai sword. I just had Cam and Stephen on. I would like a samurai sword. Yeah, you got the W. You got the W co-founders. I did. Yeah. I didn't I didn't get to meet those boys. I've met I talked to regularly. Um man, why am I having I think Sam was one of them. Derek Sam and Derek were the ones who gave me the sword. Yeah. So, all to say though, so they they came out, right, because now got that [ __ ] deal. So, they were at uh they were in London and we were all sitting around this table and someone comes up and he's like, "God, those those [ __ ] guys, they're just all like clones and it was tuned up like there were some definite aggressive party nights at this event, by the way." Um, so it's like 3:00 in the morning. They're like, "They're all clones." Like, "What do you mean?" It's like, "Dude, no matter which one you talk to, they're all saying the exact same shit." Yeah. And like what they have fostered with that like young Gen Z like direction that they're going, cult culture that they have is like cult culture that they have is amaz like crazy. They can all say they're all saying the same thing. They're all going the same direction. It's like here's what we're doing. Here's this direction we're going. They have like, you know, very little remote, right? Everyone's in that uh New York office in the what is it? Domingo or Domino, whatever. You can still do it remote totally fine. No, no, for sure. But I'm just saying like they went the extra Yeah. Now they're talking like, you know, multi. They're doing that, but they're like, "Yeah, we need to keep core." And they have that. Exactly what you're talking about. They'll do these daily standups. Everyone's jammed in. They can't fit in the rooms anymore. So, it's like they've got this glass wall. It's profound what that does. To be clear, I'll give you a good one. Right? When you run an ad and you drive it over to a landing page, if there's inongruency between the ad and the landing page, how [ __ ] is that conversion rate going to be? Right? Now, imagine, right, you have congruency between the ad, the landing page, and then they go and communicate with literally anybody in your organization, like a salesperson initially, potentially a CSM when they inevitably buy andor potentially customer service rep through maybe some of the site support that you offer, customer service phone lines or emails. That congruency that you're talking about having effectiveness between an ad and a landing page and inongruency causing a drop in conversions. The same exact thing happens with people and the people if they don't have that same missiondriven outcome and the shared collective set of beliefs. There's a tremendous amount of financial loss that occurs from that inongruency. But more importantly than that, as I mentioned, like these people will show up and they'll typically do a lot more. Like they'll produce a lot more. They'll have a lot more fun. It's just it's just a better quality of life that you'll experience when you inherit that good genuine missiondriven worldview. Add to lander and so we were talking about this the other day. So in ours now and in high ticket world this is very common but we didn't really think or talk about it. I guess we definitely all thought it maybe but like didn't talk about it when someone comes in now they have yes the entire marketing funnel right so like a VSSL optin funnel it's the you know four or five whatever core things boom okay and all the messaging that exists there. Next they're going to talk to a setter before they talk to a closer. So, they're going to talk to a setter, a closer, they're then going to talk to a CS rep who does the onboarding piece. Then they're going to talk to a coach, then they're going to have the kind of couple touch points in there, and then they're going to talk to like a retention sl. So, they have five direct touch points of like who they have talked to in the company at one given point. And it's like when churn exists and when all this like are they all saying the same thing? Are they all living the same methodology? Are they all are they all representing the brand? But like we didn't really talk about that much until the other day and we're like, "Ooh." Because we would have like a breaking point. We had a couple uh instances where a client would come in, start talking to a coach, and like it was not in alignment. Like the client was like, you know, I'm not going to go there, but like was uh out of the out of the box. Out of the box. You like my face right there. I was going to say you got this little like smoochy face in the corner. Uh yeah, but like no, seriously though, like it was just not in alignment. And we we kick clients out who are like that. Yeah, you should. So like they come in [ __ ] love kicking the wrong and we do that. Yeah. And we're just like cool refund. Very liberal in that regard of like if someone comes in and gets bullied from a sales rep and like you hear back and it's not good or like husband like there's an issue there. Cool. Refund like try to win. Try to win. I'm just talking about somehow the wrong people get in. Like I'm talking about the wrong person came in and as like some personality traits that we just are not going to accept in our community and had said some stuff to some coaches and like some Yeah. And we're like well done. Like sorry about this like all good. Here's your money back. But it was a very interesting thing for us. We're like oh this is interesting. And then we had some stuff on the back end that was happening where there was some difference in aggression of selling uh and it like didn't align with how they had experienced the other portions of the company and how we like like to show um but yeah it's crazy and then so let's get tactical because using that going now to the front I like call funnels I like that world and to tie these together because you because it's like malleable because you have so much room both in the cash flow both in the conversation because you're talking to a person on the phone like you have more room than I'm not a good copyriter. I'm not a good like never have been. Chad GBTC save my life because I could get stuff at least live for 80% of the way and someone could fix it after, right? And like it would it works like I know the mechanics, the math, what needs to happen structurally, all that. But like get me on an offer and like full full ideation like I've never done that. That's not really my world at all. So selling something direct to cart that's not load t that's like actually selling something like truly long form sales page truly like full VSSL script any of that stuff like that's selling it not selling to book a call haven't really I personally have not like of course people on team have but like to me webinars anything that's like direct to cart like that I just feel like it has especially for someone who's just starting such a higher risk level oh 100% than going to the phone because of the cash flow, because of the malleability of being able to like dance the phone be like, "Oh, maybe I can kind of tweak." You can sell them anything on the phone. You can completely change your offer on the phone. You know what I mean? Like your script goes from like what you're going to like, you know, pre-recorded hard pitch on a V on a webinar to like 400 people to like, oh no, this person needs these three coaching calls different than this and like, oh, if I fly out there, they'll give me another 10g. And like you can just change on the fly. Yeah. And then you can learn and then you can iterate on the on like iterate on the front end and like it's this like cool loop and I that's why I love them. That's why I think everyone should start with them. What is this whole now everyone's doing webinar funnels. I have so many instances of this. The amount of people have DM' me from going like from doing all this stuff and that I've seen the different models and you've obviously worked with a lot of people have different models but like what is the what's the meta? What's the meta? Like like you're like I I hear I hear webinar funnels. I mean I can get selfish and be like let's let's workshop how we would do one right now. because I don't want to distract. Right now we have four or five lead. So which is basically optin VSSL optins and DTAS. So direct to VSSLs and then uh we have low ticket which are low ticket ascension not AOV focused. Smart play, right? So like those are the two and now so we have like four or five webinars right now. We've never done a webinar. Yeah. Typically the big ones call funnels depending on your and and I want to be really clear depends on where you originate from and what types of funnels you're already running. A lot of people that come to us, they'll already have gotten something going with paid or they're coming from organic and just getting into paid. And typically, you have to have something that you can roll over that's already worked well with your sales organization if you're taking calls, whether it's from webinars, low ticket to high ticket, DM ads, call funnels, doesn't matter what it is. It's typically best to roll over whatever already works. So, it's very important to play into your strengths in that regard to reduce the risks of initially spending money via paid ads. But it can be any one of those p paid call funnels to be clear. Dude, we I want to be very direct when I say this. When we sell to the general public, we'll do an opt-in on a VSSL funnel. But typically when we sell [ __ ] hate, you hate money. What does anybody say? Nobody ever listen nobody ever does basic [ __ ] math on call funnels where if you have an opt-in and you look at the people who don't apply or even apply and don't schedule, okay, and you just run a basic report that says how many people were we able to sell that opted in and never scheduled. It is shocking in most instances to the person who runs the report for the first time that they literally make like no money off the people who opt in. No, they'll make no money off the people who opt in and don't schedule. Like they don't have any system. No, no, no. Correct. Me, too. Yeah, we are. We are those people. Yeah. I was I was doing I was doing the count of leads that never book. I was saying was I was 60 70% but you're not even selling to the people who opt in. It's like that's what I'm talking about. And most people it's like it's like in it doesn't matter even what duration. I'm taking notes. I'm not I'm not I'm not texting. very important to understand like over whatever duration you actually look the justification is usually oh well we're going to collect their email and we'll be able to sell to them later or like oh I got a setter team that's going to call them and sell them and it's like okay well why the [ __ ] is nobody buying then if you run the math and you see literally nobody bought who opted in and didn't schedule. Okay. So, generally the justification is remove the opt-in even sometimes if you're selling to the general public because all it does is just you're will you're willingly and artificially inflating your own cost per call in that case. So, typically removing it is better. But I want to be fair and saying if you do actually run the math and you obviously see that you do sell people who opt in who don't schedule but later buy, nothing wrong with that. That's the justification to keep it. But you have to have the right systems in place, whether it be the marketing automation to support it, the remarketing to support it, and or just the setter team that's aggressive as you would call it, the sickos to be able to reach out to those [ __ ] and hit them up, dude. So, do you know our flow of our of our core one? You've talked about it. Okay. So, a little bit. So, like ours is ugly as opted page. That's like OG. That's name and email only, not phone number. We put phone number. It's 25 30% drop in that. And again, we aren't utilizing, we've tried things with AI, text, and we, you know, setters. We didn't have setters until 71 million by the way. So fun fun fact uh 30 minute call 30-minute bookings volume just go go go go go go. That's just what it's been. So now all these shifts have happened and changed. But for us the idea behind it is again we're yes we're selling kind of like we have a if you look at the ma like the math of the demographic we're selling to like yes they are of in comparison to the rest of the market it is technically like the highest you know disposable income bracket. Yes. But is it the business owner that's doing XYZ or is it the high performer or do you know like any of that? It's technically the general public. Yeah, it's technically mass market B toC. Right. So for us it's landed around consumption and when you throw them to a DTA page they are not yet there. They are not there emotionally. They're not there consumption-wise. So ours is optin put it through a VSSL like a true gated uh wait until the CTA. I mean our VSSLs are 26 20 you know 30 and the CTA is there at like 24 minutes then apply we send them the classic kind of like go to the bonus page get your get your free bonuses get your free bonuses replay on top of there ton of testimonial wall to get bonuses more consumption they get free products they can get access to and then they have contextual emails for every bucket so they have the app no apps they have the app no books they have like the no-show like we have all those and then we email twice a day every day good and send that to the main list of 30-day opens and 90day day clicks and then which is hundreds whatever thousands right twice a day every day. Yeah. Good. And uh those get pushed 98% of the time 95% of the time to value that's on the site. So they get linked to a video that's on the site. We do insane amount of content production. That's all basically middle and bottom of the funnel. We have never optimized for organic like true like virality or whatever which we should and we're now trying to lean into a little bit because it's like stupid that we haven't. The trust element of it is people will look you up in these other Well, no. So we have that. So that's what I mean. So like it exists for middle and bottom. So, we'll take something, upload video, long form. We just hit a million view uh downloads on the podcast. Like, we have all that stuff. They go onto the site, we send an email, link them there, they hit it, and it's like, "Oh, here are another 300 videos I can watch that are specific to me in some capacity." Or, "Oh, it's like menopause, mindset, uh, muscles, macros, right? Like they hit these different buckets and they do that. That's where the consumption lives." And every CTA is apply now. Everything is apply now as it should be, right? So like that's been our model but now low ticket thing very interesting but DTA is just such an interesting one for us where it's just headline VSSL button and it's like the consumption's kind of not there. Can I tell you about I'm going to tell you about tech real quick. Okay. It's called it's called horizontal funnel scaling. Okay. And I accidentally did this one time with that guy I was telling you about the the top three most dialed in people. Mark he had a page that was just that headline VSSL application. And I go, I think we could do better than this. And so we created a split test. It was headline, video, application, testimonial section. And it was just page variation two is what we called it. And all you added was testimonial section. All I did all I did was add a testimonial section. I went into the campaign right in the ads manager. I duplicated the campaign and all I did in that duplicated campaign was go to the ad level and just change the URL to page variation number two. Is that how you split test by the way? That is in this case in particular is what I I chose to do. No, I mean I have plenty of ways that I could do. It depends. I want to be really clear. It depends. In some instances, there's plenty of other ways I could choose to do it, but in this particular case, that's what I chose. We'll do that sometimes. We We have an internal beef. That's why I'm kind of like talking about that because it's like, wait a minute, a different ad might have a golden rule. I don't give a [ __ ] about whatever bias I may or may not have towards what I think is right. I don't want to be right. I want to make money. So, long story short, if that specific way I chose to do it in that instance didn't work, I'll do it any other way, Ryan. I don't give a [ __ ] So anyway, back to my point. I duplicated the campaign. I changed the URL to page number two. Yeah. Okay. Pressed publish. Let it get approved. Is what his URL was. It was literally slashb by the way. Literally slashb. So So it publishes, gets approved, and this is during the co era. And I just kind of forgot to go back and like look at the test and turn one off. They just both end up running. And there was like a $10 discrepancy between the cost per call that one or the other was producing. All it did was a positive thing. got additional call volume at a favorable KPI for a cost per call. Yeah. So, we ultimately concluded not to shut one or the other off. You know what we did from there? We did it seven times in a row. So, we created a third page variation. And what we did on the third page variation was duplicate page variation number one headline VSSL application. And we changed the VSSL to a different VSSL. Duplicated the campaign. Went to the ad the ad level. Changed the URL to slash C page variation three. published that bad boy. Again, couple dollar difference in cost per cost per call and super happy with the result. So, in the fourth page variation, we took the entire first VSSL and we turned it into a long form. We we turned it into a long form page sales like like long form page, same call to action, book a call, but instead of headline VSSL application, we just did long [ __ ] copy page call to action to book a call. Worked like a charm. maybe like a 30-ish dollar difference in cost per call on that one, but a very favorable cost per call. Moral of the story, we do this upwards of seven times. And then at that time, that guy got bought out. And then obviously, we would have done it, I would have imagined, like you're so diversified on your acquisition. I'm not exaggerating, dude. We probably would have done that like dozens of times in a row. And a lot of the times, what you might think is is like, as an example, you made upwards of 70 plus million dollars off just a callunnel. Why in the world would you not just consider taking that same exact call funnel and duplicating it out and changing a simple section or a simple variable that's already on the page? We we for as an example like variation five, six or seven, I don't remember which one it was. By that point, we were like, "All right, page variation number one, but we'll just change the headline on that specific variation." And every single time, here's what's important to understand. When you find a majority hook or you find a hook that has a large swath of people that continuously buy from it, there's no need in most instances to try to test too far beyond it. The better way to approach it is let me do horizontal funnel scaling or let me take that same set of hooks and package it into a different conversion mechanism. Like you can introduce low ticket because to be fair that's a preferential way for some people to buy comparatively to the way you're currently attempting to get people to buy. you realistically without exaggeration could have tacked on a whole another couple million a month. Yeah. Just through having things like a webinar as an example for the people who have that preference of purchase the low ticket to high ticket DM ads, content ad strategies. There's plenty of things you could have done. But to be fair, it's really important to note you you found something that worked and all you really need to do more more so it's a priority in my opinion to do before you choose almost anything else is to horizontally funnel scale that bad boy because then you end up having this diverse amount of campaigns. Yeah, that you can scale the [ __ ] out of. And you don't even have to do them all within the same account. You could do them across several ad accounts. So, you diversify the risk a little bit as well. And I'm not exaggerating, dude. I think that might hit harder than some of these other things that you might take on as an initiative. But here's the cool part. Like we talked about before, being a rich person, you don't have to live a life of either ors. You know what you can do at your current point in revenue is you can hire an individual and say your sole responsibility is this specific funnel. So, a a great example of this all got Tai bless you. Okay? When my buddy Brandon Carter and I when one of us sneeze, we say, "Ty bless you." Because Mr. Ty Lopez and the amount of revenue that man's [ __ ] made, okay, as a great lesson to this, Ty, I'll give you a good example like how Tai and I currently work together. He gave me a challenge funnel. He was like, "You just cracked a fuckload of money on a challenge funnel with one of your clients. Let's run a challenge funnel together." It's like we don't work together in any other capacity currently beyond just this current challenge funnel we're going to run a bunch of traffic to spend a fuckload of money on and try to get a thick lump sum from. How many other markets you think Tai has at once right now that own different specific funnels? Can you think to yourself how beneficial it would be rather than just having a single individual or even potentially two individuals manage all these different types of funnels and instead just say, "Okay, you currently run the low ticket to high ticket division. You currently run my callfunnel division." If you have that person that runs your callfunnel division that you're going to dare take attention off that [ __ ] and put onto some of these other initiatives, I would implore you to instead hire an individual role per conversion mechanism type, per funnel type. You understand the power of that is extreme. Yeah, I know that is and it adds a tremendous dude. A player talent on that. Like what do you think I'm going to do with this Tai challenge funnel since that's the only way right now I'm going to be able to make buu bucks with Tai? hammer it, dude. That's all my attention right there. Yeah. It's just on that deal, just on that one funnel type. Anytime I get a client that's like, "All right, you got this funnel to run and this funnel to run and this funnel to run and this funnel to run." It's like, don't get me wrong, we'll still crack a good couple mill a month or a mill a month or do our absolute best on the deal. But I can't stress it enough. It's like, why do you think you hit that number? And why do you think it was all from one funnel type? Yeah, that's what I was saying earlier. Like right now all I keep saying is one lead funnel, one buyer funnel and it's like oh we have six of these and like oh when we have six low tickets and it's like can we just crack one to three to 500 and it's low and is think about this like low ticket to high ticket is a good idea but it should be a specific person in your account. The the horizontal funnel scaling though it plays into that exact same thesis of technically it's all still one funnel type. Yes, it's just you might add a different hook onto one of these funnels or you might just change a specific section or add or remove a specific section or change a variable for a specific section. Have you haven't done that yet? That's one of my favorite. We have like scaling strategies some portion and it's funny because Luke's always like, "Oh, the ad account likes variety and like he'll like always say this stuff, but like we'll have a different because we were split testing two VSSLs for months." Yeah. Like too long. and they were like basically the same which means you have no winner and like but the idea was just like well if you have the same and like our tracking was kind of not amazing then so we're like we don't know exactly but they're pretty close and we had one of them uh set as the control on the replay page which obviously gets a shitload of views because most people are going to opt in start to watch it come back to it later in their email in some capacity and like do that later. So that one was really getting like a majority of the mind share but both were on the front and we left it for like eight months. Yeah. Of just like two of them in there and that was a big you know during that era of like us going dude you should have done it upwards of seven times over. Yeah. I mean at some at some level we did but yeah now we have four or five actual frontends full dedicated funnels. We have like two different Yeah. two different messaging ones from one brand face and then we have another brand face one and then we have uh the original brand face on a DTA and then we have an original brand face low ticket. So right now we have five core that are running and it's like which one is actually actually working that's that can beat the control because that's what my whole thing is like can we just beat the OG one that we've now literally rammed like 75 probably of it through and it's like which one and there's one in there and it's funny because the CTA in there talks about how it's like this high ticket program and stuff that they're applying for and it's like show rates are better, close rates are better, cash collected per is better. It's like lean into that one. Yeah. Like that's you know the kind of clear winner and it has a different messaging line. So again, not my full speed. Marketing team's got this unlock, but like yeah, so we're dancing that line, dancing the sales line, dude. Sounds good. Hey, I'll wrap this up for Ryan because to be clear for all those who don't know and maybe potentially see this episode posted whenever you choose to post it. We've got one of my favorite people in the house. And I don't know how you're going to pull this off, but you probably got another good few hours of interviews to go through with the legend, Mr. Josh Troy. Runs Wires from Strangers. Why are some strangers? Arguably one of the highest standard people I think I've met inside of the sales space and I I don't want to sit here and hog the talk time here tonight. Does that mean we have a part three coming? Dude, I think we arguably technically so I guess, right? You know, we didn't even really get to get that much stuff. Yeah. Moral of the story is I'm happy to do a part three, you know. Let's see what the people say after this one. But anyway, moral of the story, per usual, thank you for having me on. Thank you for you guys for watching this. You can find a bunch of my stuff on YouTube, too. Ryan said last time, he said, "If you watch Jeremy's channel, you probably watch my channel and vice versa." And I went into my YouTube studio thing after, and you're actually the number one channel that YouTube tells me other people watch that watch my content. So, you were absolutely right in that regard. So, moral of the story is you probably already watch all my stuff anyway. Here's here's an ending question, though. How big do you think the market is? For which market of info coaching people that are doing over 100k a month right now in terms of just like quantity of people? Yes. Like what do you how large is it? Is it 500? You say like a couple hundred thousand people realistically. You think hundred couple hundred thousand? I deeply believe. Yeah. Because there's so many people that you Here's the thing, Ryan. We don't know what we don't know. I have no idea. That's why I'm asking. I I believe that there's far more than what you and I can think of. I think there's people out there who don't talk about it. I think there's who don't know that we call it info coaching. I I think there's so many more people than we can fathom. And here's the thing, dude. 100K is only a measly [ __ ] 1.2 mill a year. So if you really think about it, you're telling me that you don't think there's easily at least a 100,000 people that are doing amazing. If you loop in the also the coaches, the consultants, the people do like expert speaking gigs, the guy all info in general is very important to understand like it's an intangible me communicating something in my brain to you no matter how I package it. Info. So to your point depends if you're just trying to isolate it to like courses or some type of coaching product. If you include consultants, obviously it's very easy to justify a couple hundred thousand people, but I think easily a couple hundred thousand people. Yeah. It's also very important to to be clear when I say this. There's people like you and I who like openly just go talk about these kinds of things, but like think about the quantity of people that just don't have that same belief where they're like, dude, look, I've got my little pocket audience of people. I'm doing relatively good. Like, you know, Jeremy's sitting here ragging on making only 100 G's a month, but whatever. You know, I'm happy with it. I have a great quality of life. I think there's a tremendous amount. I think there's a tremendous amount. Honestly, I I think my number might be on the short side of things. Interesting. Yeah. There's seven plus billion people. We're almost billion people on the planet. Dude, you're telling me you don't think a measly [ __ ] couple hundred grand or The reason I'm asking is because like when I started doing this, I was like, "Okay, cool." Like based on the people I see in the niche in the online, right? It's like once you start to get into beginner land is when you start to kind of like go like this on subscribers. It feels like and like I didn't want that. That was like my specific goal was not to like over produce and do it in a direction or like make it all catchy and whatever way. It was like stay in pocket, stay in the honeypot. I feel like I did a good job of that, but it's like, you know, 7,000 people or something. I'm like, cool. That is like enough of my honey pock. I was going for 3,000. I see yours your subscribers. Yeah. Of like subscribers and like X and like all that time I make this video, I just cleared 165 earlier today. Okay. I thought it was pretty cool. I I started literally one year ago. So that's what I'm thinking is like what do you think a breakdown of your 16,000 people are? Like how many are doing 100k a month? Like I know from who DMs me. Yeah. Like when I was at 300 subscribers, it was like real honey pot. And it's like I had people who were doing 2 million a month. I had people who were doing 500k a month like in DMs like at that. And then when I went like this from some kid sharing it on X, it was like some affiliate guys, some lead genen guys, some SAS. It's like that X pocket is really kind of what my they I want to be fair and saying like my my content that I consistently make is for people that are already doing a couple hundredk a month and are trying to crack million dollar months or already at a million a month and trying to crack another million a month on top of that. And I consistently see through our qualified applicants that come through a tremendous quantity of those types of people. And I I can't stress it enough though. Obviously, there is still a large quantity of people that aren't in that demographic that still learn a tremendous amount from us. So although I'll consistently and will keep continue calling out that demographic as my ideal target audience that I'm communicating to because I'm making the videos for, you know, I love million-dollar men. I think they're so important, but at the end of the day, it's like, yeah, there's there's probably still a large swath of people that just like me when I first started, dude, I'd be [ __ ] watching our content when I was poor. I'd be I know. I know. That's Yeah. So, that's why I'm trying to gauge on what the number is. Cuz I was like, if I got to like 30K, I was like, "Oh, that's not good for me." Like, that's not my pocket is what I've like had this belief around. Could be completely wrong. Again, I'm I'm I am actively doing things wrong. You know, there's plenty of instances where I've reached the qualified people through a technically unqualified person that binge watches my content and says, "Oh, you got to like works for one of these people and says like, "Hey, man. I think you should watch this shit." I got I got a really That's true. I got a really big connect on X from that that Here's the thing, dude. Like as much as in my content, as I mentioned, like I will openly rag on making less money, it's just me trying to implore people and encourage people in my way of doing it to get richer and understand the importance of money and try to make you feel smaller than than what you might think yourself of. So you try to get bigger. Yeah. You know, I in I in no way, share, or form like hate poor people or like think of think less of people that make less money than me. But I I don't give a [ __ ] if they watch our content. I'm happy for them to watch our content. I think it's important for them to watch our content, too. But yeah, moral of the story is you got to expand your mission a bit. You know, you don't want to stay small. There's no justification, no good justification for attempting to stay small because at the end of the day, you getting a lot more reach with this type of messaging at the end of the day is always going to lead to a dramatically higher probability of you reaching more of the right people. Even if you reach a tremendously greater quantity of the wrong people, because the ratio will realistically stay the same the entire way up, the number just gets bigger and bigger. I I don't believe in going small. I don't believe in staying small. I don't believe in the logic of small. I deeply believe in the power of big. And and it be my bias against yours. But no, no, no bias. I'm telling you right now as big as you can. No bias. It's just like an initial my initial thought was around that was if I reach outside of this pocket, it's not what my initial goal was, which I hit my initial goal. So now it's like the reframe, the rephrase, like what rich people out there that you need to help and get your messaging in front of. Speaking of that, I have someone actually you just reminded me of that reached out to me that said they wanted to get in touch with you. So, I have to connect with you after this. Happy to help. That you'll love that crushed it that's in the nine figures last year. Excited to help him. You know, I love Dude, if I can help person making nine figures and something last year. Yeah. Let me know. I'm happy to help. Bing bong. Well, listen. Moral more of the story. Thank you for watching. Appreciate you being here. Ryan, do your outro. Do do your thing. I don't have an outro. All right. Well, yeah. Peace out then, I guess. Huh. Bye, guys.
