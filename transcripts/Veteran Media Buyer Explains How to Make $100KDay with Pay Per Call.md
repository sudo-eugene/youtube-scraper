# Veteran Media Buyer Explains How to Make $100K/Day with Pay Per Call
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q7WzSONnX4

What's up, guys? Today's video, we have a heater paper call legend, Carlos. I'm gonna let Carlos kick it off, but today's day 85 of making these videos every single day since I started. So, we are we're on a heater here, too. So, great guest, Carlos. Who are you? What's your online biz journey? Uh, thank you, Ryan. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And to keep it short, I started online, well, I'm going to date myself, but I started online back in 2006, 2007, uh, with a PDF from Perry Marshalls. I was like, you know, the ultimate guy to Google AdSense and ads at the time. And then fast forward to 2018, I came across Paper Call and I've been in the industry ever since. Um, originally I started as a media buyer, a publisher, and then it evolved into a a whole network of paper callers all over the world. Nice. Yeah, I think uh that seems to be like a I don't want to say hot necessarily, but it's like almost still underground in that in that game for newbies at least. Like obviously the the guys that are in it are in it. Um, so what's your I mean what's your stack right now? So you've got a bunch of stuff going on B. Yeah, I see your stuff on Instagram and it's like 3,000 calls today. You got 60 live. You got all this. So, is that So, you guys aren't running yourself now. So, do you guys still do Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. We have an internal media buying team which I lead and we focus on certain verticals that we do very well on. And then we have the network side of things where we, you know, fully vet uh publishers, usually publishers that came into us uh very early in their journey and they stuck around and they learn how we media buy and stuff because we do like coach, not coaching, but masterminds uh weekly and you know, so we're on the same page. They're independent, but we're on the same team, quote unquote, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So is that considered and I'm and I'm pretty new to this game so shut me shut me up or tell me where I'm like wrong but like so is that considered if you're a network right that's very similar to brokering right so you already have correct yeah correct okay so how do you guys solve for because I talked to Nate Anellet and I've I've done stuff on marketing tech side of this like I had some friends when you know prior life where I was doing posts and everything for them back to like ACA direct buyers to all this stuff and so that's why yeah shout out that right but he uh he talked all about brokering and how to set that up. So, how do you handle stuff like cap if you have that much, right? Because I hear this stuff where you get stuck in a in a hole where you can only have x amount of Medicare, you do this or do you guys stay in different lanes? Like what kind of niches? A lot of questions. So a lot of our buyers we develop a you know personal relationship with in the sense that you know usually we start a campaign very small and then over the course of weeks, months and years we develop a relationship. So our cap in the sense is pretty secure because of how we approach it, right? And how we work with our buyers and the kind of relationship that we built that goes, you know, beyond um just calls, right? And that's how we get our, you know, that's how we get, I guess, our cap because we've been working with the same buyers for years and years. Yeah. Interesting. So, for you guys, I mean, I see your stuff. I was, we were talking real quick before this, but dude, I've bought I mean, I I everyone knows on this that listens to this that I buy everything. Like, I'll buy this course, I'll buy this training, I'll buy or just watch, right? So, like you have a ton of YouTube content that's years of stuff, right, that you put out. And then you also have I think I'm even in a Slack channel that you guys have that's like I think you're either network side but a ton of education like a ton of education. So, is that I mean there's obviously tons for free and then there's a little is there like a small pay gateway or uh uh kind of so I'll tell you you know to put it into context and I I spoke this uh before in like other podcasts and stuff like that. But when I first got into paper call I was doing a lot of home services stuff. So I was doing a lot of like you know plumbing water damage and all that stuff. And then a a good friend of mine, she told me, "Hey, you should look into flights." I don't know if you're familiar with that campaign, but it's for people that are looking to book a flight, an airline flight. So, they go online and they call and usually a consolidator will, you know, sell them the ticket like an Expedia or something like that, right? So that's when I I I look into flights and then I remember being outside of my daughter's uh pediatrician office and I was like in my laptop connected to their Wi-Fi cuz it was during co so only one person could go in the office with the mask and the whole n yard. So I was I went into Google uh that's what I started media buying. So, I went into Google and I set up like a a quick um you know flight campaign and I set it live. I totally forgot about it. 3 days later I see that you know I log into Ringbot and I see like hundreds of missed calls and none of them like you know connected to any buyer and it because I only set up like part of the campaign. I didn't do it completely. And you know that campaign was a game changer cuz with that campaign I was able as a single media buyer to like generate my first like mail um in a paper call campaign. And it only took me like 3 4 months to do it. And I was like wow this is pretty good. You know you can generate a million dollars uh running a flight campaign. Uh but I was like you know that's not enough. like I I understand that you know might seem like a lot of money but I was like you know that's that's not enough um how can I do this without being so dependent on my output so that's when we decided to come up with like you know training programs and I created a training for Medicare right and how to generate Medicare calls and stuff like that and then I reach out to a bunch of people that I know I was like hey listen this training out let me know what you think blah blah blah. We started running the campaign. We hit a million dollars within 10 days. I'm like, "Okay, now we're talking. This is more my speed, right? If we collectively do it, then we can definitely ramp it up." And that's when we started focusing on training. I went on onto selling info products, you know, high ticket, you know, $25,000 programs. But if I'm sure I don't know if you've done it before, but if you have it is exhausting. It is like you know it's I don't play that game. We're in the in space but like through the company like not actually me being coach or Okay. Well me doing it I'm telling you like you know being in front of the camera that thing is no joke. But I learned so much. I learned so much from doing it because I was setting up campaigns on a daily basis uh for other people fixing things. So, it's like I was in the gym 24/7 if you put it that way, right? Uh and I did that for like a whole year until I was like, you know, I can't do this anymore. I I I feel very honored that you want to give me such a so much money for my time, but I can't like burning me out. So we decided to make it for free and now it's doing better than ever. So we came up with uh unique 360 uh which is a white label of uh go high level. We just add value to it in the sense that we add you know paper call funnels uh paper call quizzes, chat bots, different landing pages that we use as well as we have a whole creative team that is constantly adding creatives that uh work for paper call for different verticals like you know final expense, Medicare, auto plumbing, you name it. And we have our weekly mastermind. So, I still commit one hour a week to jump in and into our uh masterminds where usually I bring in uh another guest and I'm you've been to some of our calls so you know that how crazy they can get. Yeah. So, that's what I've been up to. It's it's a Yeah, it's amazing. Seems like a lot. Yeah. The the info as like the small small barrier and you know uh Gabe Anel, right? he does his version of this and he has his but then same thing it's like has this backend and it's all the people you meet in there which is huge for your business model but then also you having the monetization method of then them you know being publishers through your and like doing it correct network it's amazing it's amazing you don't need to sell your time for 25k if you can do it on you know autopilot a little uh but we're correct so correct the bigger picture at least for me it's a microtransactions So instead of charging like a a a big amount or upfront cost to learn it, we rather just teach it for free. Like you know like this is the minimum that you're going to that you're going to require in the sense that if you want to jump into paper call or lead generation at the very minimum you're going to need like funnels and landing pages and some type of CRM, some type of automations and text messages or AI voice or you name it. So that's why we, you know, went the route of creating unique 360 so we can add the additional value there and then make it like an irresistible offer for anybody that wants to jump in no matter um you know where they are in their journey or how much capital they have, right? And that's exactly you know what we've been doing and growing it that way. And so far it's working, you know, pretty amazing. I can't complain. It's every day keeps growing and growing and I'm like hell yeah, let's do it. So focusing in the in the microtransactions because the ultimate goal is that we are so transparent and with you and we support you and and in and the journey that eventually we want to earn your trust and when you do decide to do business we will love you know the opportunity to do business with you and that's where the microtransaction comes into play. you know, us either buying or selling you calls. That's where we see the real revenue and the real throats. Yeah, it's amazing. It's It's just this much longer term, right, versus like these like and just thinking that far ahead. I mean, you see the awards back there. We were joking right before this, but I love those. I was like, "Adam, what do I need to do?" And he's like, "What do you mean, what do you need to do? You need to do a million or 10 million or 100?" I'm like, "Okay, fine. Well, I've never run anything, but So that's cool." So that's like really business in a box. So, somebody who has zero idea about paper call can go to this, learn from the ground up, and get all of the funnels, all the automations, the like all you don't need to be on a hay flow. You don't need your own ringbo. You don't need any of that if you're through your stuff. I highly you don't technically no, you don't need it, but I highly recommended that you do get it because as much as I would like to buy all your calls, a reality is that we're not able to do so because of the dynamic of how um call routing works. So, I highly recommend that you have your own account and that you add your own buyers to your distribution. Like the biggest mistake that people make in paper call and at least from my point of view uh or what I've seen it it has nothing to do with the creative or with the funnels themselves. It has a lot to do with the distribution of their calls and their call routing. Uh we can always optimize creative and funnels to have higher conversion rates uh higher CTRs you name it. Uh but a lot of people do not focus on the distribution side on your call routing and then they you usually sign up for one network and have a single buyer run a campaign and be like oh this [ __ ] doesn't work right. Uh, so normally when that happens, I'm like, "Show me how many buyers you have." No, I only have a single buyer. There you go. Right. Interesting. Yeah. So, you know, it's not going to work. So, you are going to need to have, you know, at least I recommend that you have at least, you know, 10 buyers cuz that's going to guarantee that somebody's going to answer the phone call. Yeah. Right. If you're pinging 10 different rooms and 10 different um you know call routings of their you know if you're pinging a network that that network pings all their buyer if you're pinging independent buyers or direct buyers and so forth you have to realize that for every person on the phone you also need one agent on the other side. So that's why you have to stack up your buyers so your call doesn't hit the floor. And in in the case that it does, you want to be your own buyer. And and what do I mean by that? With technology right now, it's pretty easy to set up using like retail AI or Senseflow or similar software. It's very easy to set up an inbound uh call center, right? where if nobody wants to pick up your phone call, you should be the person that is picking up the phone call and then getting consent to reach out to the consumer whether it's on a call back or uh through email or through text messages and be able to monetize that uh instead of just letting it drop and sitting like as a nov value call in your dashboard. So what does what do those softwares specifically do? So, is it like a live call? Is like AI conversation? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Just like an AI uh I don't know if you share stuff in in your calls, but I can share some stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you share whatever you want. Okay, cool. Let me click here this share button. Give me one quick second. You're good. No one's ever shared anything. This is exciting. Uh the gatekeeping. Yeah, we do. Sometimes we're like, "Hey, if you don't want to do, you don't have to dox." But we're all about the numbers, so we're about anything. Yeah. So, um this is like retail AI. So, you can set up here, you know, different AIs, uh with like click and drop, uh type of conversation workflows. Mhm. So, um here you can see that I have a inbound AI, right? That is going to be like, hey, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? so on and so on. Let me show you better than Hello, you are on a recorded line. Thank you for calling the benefit center. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Yes, my name is Carlos Corona. Hi Wing, thanks for that. Just to confirm, do you currently have Medicare Part A and Part B? Uh, yes I do. Great. Wing, can you please confirm your zip code for me? Yes, that's 33130. Thanks, Wing. And um could I also get your cell phone number, please? Uh yeah, that's 954-2478645. Thanks, Wing. Um I also wanted to ask if it's okay to send you occasional updates and promotional messages via text. Yeah, that's fine. Thanks, Wing. Just to finish up, can you please confirm your date of birth for me? As you can see, we collect the full, you know, val there in the lead. So then we can follow up uh you know, either through text message or any other way, right? Yeah. So how do you how do you then monetize those? So you're following up by text to push them back once you have openings on or Yeah. Then then you can monetize it either um through open like you said either through opening um when the call center is open again and you can also monetize it uh through our sock or email or you know Google ads or however else you want to sell it. Interesting. Yeah. So I was on with someone yesterday. They were talking about the hidden economics, right? And like where so many people leave things on the table and that's, you know, as simple as some people splitting their lists and, you know, mailing that way, the data play of being able to do that. But just something that sounds like obvious but clearly isn't for drop calls. Um, that's correct. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was I was in a call yesterday where you know somebody else that I was consulting um and and I was showing him like the numbers of how much revenue we're generating for no value calls for calls that were not picked up that we and then take oursel get consent and then we monetize it um uh thereafter and it was like wow that's daily I'm like yeah that's daily which otherwise it would have gone So like, you know, waste. Yeah. All right. That's insane. Yeah. See, you said a lot of things in there. So, do you talk about numbers? I mean, you show the calls. I have no idea. Like, again, I'm not I'm not privy to this game. I've heard the $18 call. I've heard the 20. Like, you guys are doing like volume, right? Yeah. Yeah. We don't dox those. We just talk about softwares. Um, but yeah, I mean, get the bigger picture. I mean, there's always going to be somebody that is doing a lot more than we are, and there's always somebody that is in the beginning that is trying to do, you know, way more. So, I don't want somebody to like look into the space and see like exactly like what numbers we're doing as like a benchmark. Like, we do like six figure days, right? Yeah. But, you know, like we've been doing this for a while. Yeah. Yeah. When I started, I I started making like $2,000 a week. Yeah. And you know, I had no money at the time. So, I started running and I'm like, "Wow, I'm making like two grand from this paper call," which it was way more than I was making from ecom. Yeah. So, I was like, you know, I'm I'm going to like keep keep, you know, putting time into this and see where it goes. Um, but yeah, I don't know if the IRS is watching, so I'm not talking numbers. Oh, no. No, you're good. You don't talk about anything. No, no, you're good. I can use that for the I can use that for the title. Six figure days call. Um, no, but that's uh another thing you said in there that I I'm sure is in the training, but yeah, the thing that because I'll get selfish of this, right? I have a good domain that's in the insurance space and like I have all of this stuff happening in info coaching and then I just layered on this whole like personal brand thing. It's really just to meet people, network, find talent for our company and like do stuff. Um, and it's taken up a lot of time, but I've always been like, "Oh, I want to do this side quest." And I've worked in the space. I see how scalable it is. I see that there's exit potential because it's like faceless. I see like all these pieces, right? And uh one of the big things people say is like, "Oh, make sure you have traffic before you have buyers, right?" So that's either yourself or someone. But then how do you go out and just, you know, you're getting 10, you just said 10 buyers. Like is that I'm sure that's in your training, but what's the You're a nobody. Like I'm a nobody in this game. like I can leverage some oh hey we've done you know all these sales and info coaching and a lot of people maybe don't know but how do you go find 10 buyers for a specific niche okay so what I'm about to say is probably like very unpopular but whatever um it takes money to set up one of this campaigns so you have to have your initial investment like let's say that you want to go into like fi uh final expense right final expense insurance so you have to have your initial investment where you're going to find your first buyer. And if you don't have a first buyer, Unique is happy to be your first buyer, right? Then you start pushing traffic into your first buyer and then you start collecting your KPIs, right? So you start looking at, you know, what is your cost per sale for your buyer, right? what is the average uh call length like how are they having meaningful conversations right and what kind of volume are you delivering to that buyer once you have that you can take beautiful screenshots censor the information do you don't want to share then you go ahead and you reach out to 10 100 a thousand more people and be like hey I am running my own ads on social media This is what I'm currently doing. Here's some screenshots. And by the way, here's some recordings for for so you can see what's going on, right? Make sure that you edit everything so you don't, you know, you don't share any uh PII, right? So then you send it to the buyers and usually they will reach out back to you be like, "Hey, how can I get some?" Me, I I like to do um you know, a trial if they don't know me. um like you know let's set up a trial and I'll send you like 10 free calls you know I have to pay you for them and some people be like well you're going to be losing money yeah sure upfront but I'm also going to be avoiding headaches because that's going to tell me like what kind of floor are they running like how the agents answer the phone like how well is the script that they're following and so on right so that's going to be either be like I can step in and be like look this is going to work out or this is not going to work out um without having to refund somebody or why not. Usually, it works pretty well. They they you know, if they get um a sale from their from their free trial, then they're on. They're going to be like, "Okay, so tell me more about it. How can I get more calls?" And so on. But that's how I will approach it. I will invest my own money uh to work with a buyer. If you don't have a buyer, like if a plumber, if you don't have a plumber, find a buddy of yours who is a plumber and be like, "Hey, listen. I'm going to send you some calls." like just I need to collect some data so I can go and get bigger fish, right? And run it. Once you have the the numbers, then you go ahead and be like, "Look, this is what I'm generating. Do do you want to give me a chance?" And you know, nine out of 10 they're going to say yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. I have a buddy that does uh that's just like the classic tinkerer. like he's done every little thing you can imagine and like taken all year kind of thing and then always had some like really steady remote job where he just crushes and then he crushes in crypto so it kind of doesn't matter that's like his his true passion but uh his income passion um but he does uh he does Google my business stuff so not you know that version but he is cooking for like months he's sending me these things and he's like you know doing the Google my listing game which is as people know probably like a little difficult to get all of the different properties but now that he has them built up and warm He'll send me screenshots. He's doing five six hundred bucks a day of just like that are from coming from calls. So call your local landscape or your true or whatever. And he routes them to like actual direct places with a network under it if they don't take them. So like basically like two buyer for like localized and he'll do like five six hundred bucks a day and literal profit. Like it's it I mean he has nothing. He's like Google my listing has the phone number. He doesn't even need the Landers. Like it's hilarious. And I'm like yeah it's just there's a lot of ways to make a buck in this game and Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just miss dial calls. If you ever want to do a an exercise, dial 1 800 followed by whatever random seven digits. I can guarantee you that one out of five calls are going to land in a paper call line. And you can do we can do this live. If you can dial 1 800 followed by seven random digits and if I can guarantee you that it's going to hit a paper call line. When did this game become so like I mean phones been around for but like when was paper call like you said 2006 is when you were starting but then 2018 was your paper callish, right? Like so like when did it start getting hot? Like I don't even know the time frame of Ringba or Adam and these guys like I think it started getting hot like it's been around for a while. people has been in the in the in the space since like 2010 through 2012. Okay, that's when all this call tracking platforms came about. I think like 2015 it started to heating up and then like 2018 coming in 2020 is when it really started getting hot and I think now there's so much content out there. you know, Adam from Ringbot putting out a book and all the other people that are crushing their paper call, having this events and stuff like that. So, a lot of people are looking into it like, hm, maybe I should do this cuz at the end of the day, you're running a real business, right? This is not like some type of affiliate play where you're just grabbing link and you're just pushing traffic and you never have to talk to nobody. uh here you actually you know you're building enterprise value and uh quite a few people in the space have exited for you know close to nine figures. Yeah. So it's yeah it's it's unbelievable. I mean I live in info I live in info coaching right where nobody sells you know there's two of them that have sold four of them that have sold whatever supposedly and most of them have reached escape velocity and are no longer only info coaching and that's why they can sell right they get out of it almost they starting it to get out of it um but yeah no I know I know whatever guys that sold for 50 something and something else and it's a great model so with yours though a lot of those guys generally speaking that and please correct me if I'm wrong but like are The simple example that just comes to mind is like a 1800 dentist, right? Where they own that paper call stuff and they go super deep within like one specific vertical, but your example is like the network itself that you're building with multi-vertical, multiple, you know, partners. So, do those sell? Like is that a potential play for what you're going for? Yeah. I mean, is it um cash positive, you know, as far as Yeah, it's a Yeah, anything. So that you'll tell to somebody. Yeah. But have you thought about going deep in one specific ever? Uh yeah. Yeah. We actually built a auto insurance. So we set up an auto insurance. We actually bought into an auto insurance uh agency and we're building deep into that as far as the platform. So, we're able through the through the tech that that we built, we're able to provide you with a real time auto insurance quote after you go through our funnel. So, there you go. And you put in, you know, like your information and whatnot. And then after that, it's like boom, here's like, you know, here's your quote. Then, um, the quote page, we build it in a paper call type of way. So when the person clicks the only thing you can do is call. So they call and it calls into an agency and then we go ahead and you know buy that policy and sell it. So we plan to go deep into that uh as far as like you know from the agency side as well as from the technology side and possibly uh white labeling our solution and you know enable it to other agencies. That's super cool. Yeah, that's what uh Nate on his was talking about because I I again don't really understand this super well. So he was basically saying you know you have simple term but you have media buyer then you have broker sometimes broker broker broker or you know agency and then from sales agency on the back you have uh the actual providers. So in that example he was talking about how they're going to build out a front uh a final expense actual agency. Yeah. So yeah that's like just going upstream. So that's super cool that you guys are then doing that. I'll show you real quick because I'm I'm a visual guy. I'm sure your audience are I'll show visual. So I'm here through the funnel and it says, "Hey, you know, select your car." So let's say that I drive this car and I own it. Had it for one year. Um I don't have any other second car. Let's say I'm single for simplicity and I'm a student. I have a bachelor's and Wow, I can't spell today. And let's say I pay 360. Then what this will do is it will call all the API connections for all the different contracts that we have and it's going to come back with pricing for the consumer. Right? So here you can see that National General, which is an all state company, came back with 212. Here's Progressive, um, Keer, Mercury, and so on, right? And Geico, we put lowest because people always want to call me, "Hey, what's the lowest?" So, but if you hit view here, you can see what kind of coverage it is, and you can see the phone number. So this phone number um once it's connected in the system the agent can see all the information that was input uh previously to get to the call right and they can adjust it you know adjust some of the coverage and why not to to get the best possible coverage for the consumer. So that's what we have been working on doing all the things going deep in this direction going wide in that direction free info just commoditized that's intense. Yeah, right. We got to do everything we can. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, what's your I mean, what's your goal with all this? Like your I mean, I can go in a million directions with this now based on where everywhere you go, but like what's your I mean, is it a number? Is it a Is it just Not really, honestly. My goal is to continue to work with amazing people and do what I like doing. I don't see myself doing anything else. uh I could easily, you know, spend more time into personal development and stuff like that, pick up a hobby and stuff, but at core, I'm always like, you know, a media buyer and I'm always building and always, you know, creating solutions for pain points and why not. So, this is what I actually love doing. I don't have like um an exit strategy in mind or cuz I I think if I sold then I'll be super bored like I'll be like okay so I can't compete like what am I supposed to do? Learn how to fish, you know? So this is my passion and it has been my passion forever. Uh so I see myself buying in media for the foreseeable future. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, let's uh I'm curious on this. So, just like from the start, because generally speaking, you're going to have six figure, seven figure a month guys, but you're always going to have kind of the beginner crew that are going to end up watching. Um, and I love it, right? Like sometimes I get these questions. I do a weekly Q&A and I have everyone submit this thing to a type form and I just rip through every single one of them and it's the context from over here to someone who's doing 600k a month, someone who's like, I just got a computer, right? And it's like I love like the the vastness. So for someone who's literally starting and we can even use my example of it. It's insurance. It could be what do you like the core stack is you can easily get into your thing and have your funnels your page builder right you want your own ring you can have multi buyer but what are you starting when it comes to traffic like what is in your opinion the easiest in or not easiest maybe the the best doesn't necessarily have to be easiest. Facebook works pretty well. Facebook. Yeah. If you know Google then you know some campaigns work pretty well in Google. Uh but if not I would say you know Facebook or Okay. And then when it comes to like niche selection again I come from the info coaching land where it's like basically find something you're as similar with as like that you understand already some capacity and you're also going to go high ticket right because it's like I have the most room for error and you know partner with somebody who's an expert do all that but like how do you do that in lead genen or paper call specific? Uh, it has to do with population sizes. So, the more people that will qualify for your offer or whatever it is that you're promoting, the better. So, I will say that you will stay in insurance whether it's like Medicare insurance, health insurance. Why? Because a lot of times those are subsidized by the government. So, those are pretty big as far as in term of potential uh value. uh if not they're required by the government such as auto insurance or homeowners insurance and why not right uh well not really by the government but they're required right uh so insurance is a big one then I will recommend um financial so like you know credit card debt credit repair um debt settlement student loans and stuff like that not student loan but like credit car and stuff. Yeah, I will definitely recommend those. And home services. The thing with home services is you have to keep in mind that is a very geographical uh type of play because in insurance you can have an agent that is licensed in multiple states either home or in a call center uh helping the client. In the case of roofing, you know, that roofing company is either going to be local or regional. Uh, and they only serve a certain area and stuff like that. So, just keep that in mind. Very is a very good category to be on. And then if you like dealing with [ __ ] then you can go into legal. I was going to say I see the legal guys. I get ads for those that are like But yeah, that's a different game. And we had a media buyer that uh for our stuff for info coaching that was spending like three I always say this number so vast but like that's how she would say it is 200k to 500k like a day and it was across every platform possible and they were doing those like claim cases like uh you know a Tylenol error or whatever error master yeah master. Yeah. So she would do that stuff and it's like that game is just wild to me. Like that is it's completely wild. It's insane. I don't even I don't even understand it. Like the payouts don't even come until XYZ. like what KPI are you using? Like I don't I don't understand. Yeah, that's that's why I don't deal with them. Yeah, it's it's wild because what they're doing is they're building this massive class action lawsuits and so they're ready to burn whatever budget is whether it's 10, 20, 50, 100 million building this case for potential, you know, billion payout. So they will burn like massive amount of money and trying to build these cases, you know. Nuts. It's insane. What do you think about? Yeah. So when you were saying or go ahead No, I was like, you know, we lost saw with the camp leg June. I don't know if you saw like the whole fiasco with cample June. Yeah. Yeah. The What do you think about competition in this though? Right. When you say like because I hear that talk about all the time and like Nate kind of said something. He's like, "Why am I going to have my in-house media buyers?" Well, he's like, "One, there's the conflict of interest where if I'm approving their creatives and then, you know, not running them or I am, you know, that's a gray area thing where it's like you're or not gray, I don't even know where you run the creatives that they basically provided to you inhouse. It's like, okay, you're kind of cutting them at the knees a little." But what about the idea that there are the guys, and you and I, I know some of them, you know, probably all of them, that are all they do is media buy, just the best in the world, literally. And it's like the sh is the share just so big and like the TAM is just there that you can compete with them in auto insurance for example or for Yeah, it's just so big that like everybody can win basically. Pretty much. That's awesome. I mean I I know guys that right now they're doing probably like 300k a day in auto insurance form fills and I it's not hurting me at all. Yeah, that's enough. So yeah, it's it's huge. You know, just look outside your windows, see how many cars you get to see. It's insane. And then you're you're in Michigan, so imagine, you know, exactly. It's everywhere. No, it's I don't I don't really worry or care about competition and competition is always going to be there no matter what business you run. Yeah. In the case of paper call, it's more about compliance. So, you know, yeah, correct. You know, like, can you play by the game and follow the rules? Cuz if you don't, you're I see so many guys that enter the space and, you know, 6 months later they're out because they think this is like the Wild Wild West and they were like, you know, they think they're running a ClickBank off or some stuff like that. I'm like, no, you're not. You're sending calls to a publicly traded company. Like, you got to follow compliance. You got to actually get insurance uh for cyber threats and for EOS and liabilities and stuff like that. You actually are running a legit business. It's you know you're not just an affiliate. Yeah. So at scale, I mean, I'm sure again you teach all this, I keep saying that, but I'm sure you do talk about this, but like at what kind of scale and size, like obviously you want to be compliant from the rip, but like when do you need to start worrying about these next layers? And then kind of on top of that, like obviously your community, but I'm in probably four, three or four of these like affiliate, lead gen, paper call kind of different groups on a Telegram, used to be on Skype, now it's on Teams, like these different ones. Like I feel like this industry of all the ones I've been in is the most I want to say like scattered but also crazy deep. It's like when you find a pocket of these guys, it's like you guys are all like thick as the like everyone knows each other. Everyone knows them by like like it's it's crazy. So like where do you go for that or like to find this that that kind of information I feel like is not like really readily available where it's like oh now you need like you know you need these different insuranceances or hey now and and a great example what you said like I we're in a group chat and I see this guy being like yeah I just can't get anything to work on these form fills like we've been trying for months and like it's off now and like nobody's killing it and some other guy literally responds like five minutes later he's like oh we're doing 200 grand a day with those right now. It's like what? and they're running like the same, you know, niche and offer style, but clearly different. But like where do you find those communities and pockets to learn that stuff? Uh, trade shows. So, yeah. So, like you have like Leads Con, Contact.io, Affiliate Summit, um, East and West, you have Lead Generation World, you know, just just trade shows or the Chandelier Bar, the Cosmo, you know. Yeah. So, you know, you see the same people that are the people that are actually taking it serious and they're doing numbers, they're going to be at the trade shows. And you know, once you once you come across a couple, you know, a couple people and you're genuine, you're keeping it real, you're, you know, you're actually not trying to scam or, you know, do anything shady, then, you know, everybody can make money from with each other because I can either sell to you or or, you know, buy from you or or vice versa. Yeah. So, yeah. And then like uh online like you have like you know the telegram groups uh like I can send you over and add you to more groups you know and telegram and there used to be Skype like all of us used to be in Skype and then that thing went down so everybody move over to like Telegram and why not. Yeah. Yeah. It's hilarious. you go to do I I just remember when I would try to do this a couple years ago. It's like you're going to add an affiliate manager and it's like well ping us on Skype over here and then you get in there and someone else adds you to some group chat and like especially the tech ones are hilarious. It's like now they have their tech support guy, they have the AM and they have you and you have like nine of those and you're like you just constantly played that game. But I wonder you know there used to be uh n someone talked about it but it was like they had warrior forum they had all these like forums back in the day that everyone met uh James Camp was talking about it. He's like I met all these guys on OG internet marketing days. uh on forums and I just find it interesting that there isn't like STM and stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like STM. Um I'm trying to remember the other one. There's a really good one for lead genen like MAD something. But um I don't know what hap like I I just find it interesting. I mean I guess it is more native and easy to just communicate on Telegram because like people are already kind of there. It's quick messages. It's you know but I just find it interesting that there hasn't been one that's come together that has truly centralized everyone again around something like that like I guess forum style I guess. in itself has kind of died. But the ability to have the education, the threads, the long form and the quick like reaction stuff like that versus Telegram. I'll click on that thing and it'll say 312 and I'm like I missed every like unless I have that open. I I'm not going to scroll and like try and miss and these guys are responding to this guy, this guy's doing whatever. It's like I get lost in those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. I mean that's a good one. We have Yeah, we have a Slack and we have a Telegram. Yeah, I mean I Slack and the Slack's pretty good. I like how Slack's structured in general, right? Where you can have that. And I'm in uh I'm in a high paid mastermind that's whatever like 20 something grand. Um and that is a WhatsApp group and I'm also in a Telegram version and they both do that whole like subset channel thing where it's like you talk Yeah, we do that too. Yeah, I like that a lot. We do that. We do that in Telegram. So we have like our general then we have our marketplace. So it's just people like buying and selling and then our support cuz if people and I don't want the general channel to be like clogged up with like you know offers or people asking support then we don't see it and then you know it's a bad user experience. So yeah we have it by topic. Yeah. What do you see as back to selfish but so you're starting out and you're like okay cool I am going to go find a buyer or you're the first buyer and then I go and find some others. I have my couple pages up. I'm ready to go. I start media buying. What is Let's say you're in a position where you're like, "Oh, instead I want to hire this from the beginning." So instead of me being in there media buying, which again, I don't necessarily know that's the right idea. You probably want to have your hands closer to it. You want to feel it. You want to see it before you just like outsource it essentially. But like where I'm at now with things is like I could get a media buyer probably for a percent. I could probably get a creative for a percent or like these creative deals and as could you right now be like I want a media buyer and I want a creative and I want this. I'm gonna build this lean team and I'm not gonna pay you anything off the rip, but when this thing's successful, you guys are all gonna get your like chunk. So, like, who would be the lean team if you wanted to run 20k a day up to you need a for now? You need a medium buyer. Uh, you need a prompt engineer or somebody that is really good at prompting. And you need a solid bisdev. Interesting. And what's the problem without without accounting like you know without accounting and you know stuff like that which I hope that cuz the prompt engineer can can can serve for many things. Prompt engineer can help you with landing page creations, help you with creatives, help you with all the other stuff that you just mentioned. Right. So interesting. That is not what I expected, but I like it and that makes sense to me because now you're gonna Yeah, you're going to hire a creative director, right? Somebody that's going to come up with creatives and stuff like that. I'm like, oh, I'm also going to need a um pages and funnels, right? That's assuming that you decide to take like the hard road instead of, you know, just signing up for unique 360. Shameless plug, but okay. But if if you have a solid prompt engineer, then he he or she can, you know, build all these assets for you. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. My uh my most recent journey of this was some affiliate course. Again, I will buy stuff on a weekend and spend 40 hours and just like eat it alive and test and do stuff. And the last time I did this in this realm where I was doing it myself, like we were doing Windows, me and a buddy that are like local, like I was trying to teach stuff. I don't I was like mind you I don't do this by the way but like I live in this online space but like here's how it works and here's a course that you know I'm in or here's the frame and you know he's spinning it up and he's doing two 300 bucks a day but we're like breaking even on Windows and I ended up getting one of these affiliate courses that was about um Chris Reer actually and I talked to him now. Oh I'm I'm I'm actually um launching a course with him in September. Yeah, dude. He's a savage. A savage. the first we're launching a we're co-creating a paper call course. Does he do paper call now? Uh I do and he does promotions and launches. Okay. A little bit more. Yeah, dude. He's uh he crushes with those like he has insane backend sales. They resell to the same customer like and and with new updated training and stuff, not like in a scam like Yeah, I know. I know. He's legit. That's why we're we're co-creating it. You saw it. Yeah. No. Yeah. He uh he was under uh Kramer and those guys back in the day like when I first met him before he was I I think he might still do some co-branded stuff, but um I got into the I think first variation of that and I had just like moved and whatever and just had all this time. I was like, "Oh, whatever. Two grand, five grand, whatever it was." And uh I get in and the entire thing is literally creative. That's the entire thing is like just make these ads. And I'm like, it's like scripting and then ads. Scripting and then ads. And you're testing the multiple leads out. And you're testing multiple D's and you're doing this whole thing. And the creative process, and this is like prei was so painful to me that I was like, "Oh, I'll just hire it out." And then I'm, you know, a couple thousand bucks here and videos and this and that. And it's like that wasn't the game. The game was just put your head in the laptop and make all the creatives yourself and like do it. And then you're running broad essentially. Uh on Google is how they did it back then when they were doing it. And it's just like those little things I get so hung up on or like and I know other people do where it's like oh like I have to build the pages now and then it's like a week later and it's like oh I'm tinkering with the domain and it's like just do it. But that stuff can be so like in front of your face. So it's cool that you have something like for your stuff when people pop in there and again we don't have to docs like exacts but like there's a reason people go custom eventually or that they choose to in general but like your stuff works. Yeah, I mean like you can pop your stuff up. You can make your own customizations for theme or whatever you want, but like the flows are already built that work and you already have people doing, you know, tens of thousands of dollars a day like through your stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That's so nice. Pretty much I have people that just come in and I'm like, listen, don't complicate it. What is it you want to run? Plumbing. Okay. Like call a plumber nearme.com. That's your domain right there. Buy it or you know call plum plumbing services whatever. Just add call in front of what you're thinking. Buy that domain. Connect it. So here's the funnel. Change the phone number for the phone number that we provided for you and then watch the course on how to media buy plumbing and can you do that? Boom. You're going to do it. You're going to make some mistakes and then you're going to make money. So you're going to have that instant gratification. As soon as you make money, you're like, "Oh yes, this stuff works." Then you're going to get better at it and then you're going to go from there. later on you'll be like, I want to add my own twist to it, my own sauce, whatever you want to call it. But I'm a high like I highly advocate that you get as many buyers as possible because that is the key to success in paper call. If you're running at high volume, you are going to need quite a few buyers. You can't just have one buyer. That that's like that's not going to work. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Not at the beginning. Not at Let me clarify that. Not at the beginning. If you end up, you know, closing a deal with like the select quotes of the world, you know, or a huge company that has five 600 agents, you know, any given moment available to take your calls. That's different. You know, you can probably get by with a huge buyer. Uh but at the beginning you are going to need to get those 10 40man call center uh buyers in the sense right you're going to need a multiple of those because the more that you have uh the better your call distribution is going to be you know because they go on lunch break they don't service certain states you know they're human so yeah yeah we were talking about this um back to the I think it's funny I've heard you talk I've seen these different things you put on YouTube and like you're the guy who always has the like even what you shared already on screen is like those things are don't I don't feel like those are as common at all like oh we now we're going to monetize with this hidden e economic of doing this or we're going to like way I'm I'm trying to remember when this was but like it was early AI you were talking about the voice AI agents like we tried to roll some of those out in info coaching and like didn't make sense because they needed too much context and like it wasn't there yet but like for you guys doing live transfers for example or getting like okay Do you have that like almost the yes no routing very simple like you guys have that o like og days so like are is that you are you just tinkering and you know the people and someone brings it up you find it I tell you like you know just we run a very lean team in the sense and you know I think we're 10 10 nine 10 people and you know three of us are very techy so we're always like sharing like we have this uh Slack channel that is called like cool software and we're always like dropping you know like links of stuff that we come across and then once I see something that makes sense for what we're doing like very early when AI voice I'm like wow we need this so we start like utilizing it and and why not so we trying to stay very you know to the front of what's coming out right and how we can use it to monetize it cuz I sometimes I start thinking like when you log into your Ringbot and you see X amount of calls and then you see like revenue and it says zero no value that's like oh my heart you know what I'm saying why so then you start thinking like well why there's no value well nobody was able to answer the phone call I'm like well But AI, I can answer all those phone calls. But what do I do with them, right? I I don't have somebody to transfer them to. So, best thing I can do is I can get consent and then I can add them to an SMS list and then I can follow up weekly, send them a SMS for whatever they originally call us for, right? And be able to monetize, sell it back to Google in a sense. I don't like selling it as a lead. I don't want them to go somewhere and fill out a form because then they're going to be in somebody else's list and now we're fighting for attention. Right? So, I don't want that. But I will gladly sell it as a click or as another phone call. Right now, all this no value in Ringbot are revenue in a different dashboard. And I like that, you know. So, yeah. And you say that you said this earlier too, but like inside the go high level setup like you are collecting the actual information on these forms and and you're owning the data which is not I don't want to say not super common, but there's a lot of people who don't do that, right? There's a lot of who just run straight and it's like if your ads are off today, like that's it. Like you're not making any money today because you have no data, you have no nothing. So like what is the benefit or draw? I mean, I understand the benefit, but like why wouldn't someone do that other just ease or? Um, first you need to somebody to either explain it to you and show you how to do it and then the know how, right? Cuz if not, they be like, oh, what you're telling me is so dumb. Like, I'm already doing that. I'm like, great, then that's amazing. But some people, like you said, they're not doing it because either they have it hasn't hit them yet or they like they don't think it's possible or they haven't seen any of my videos, I guess. But, uh, right. Um, but everybody should be doing it cuz people call after hours. So, I ran ads today. Somebody took a screenshot of my ad and was like, "Hey, I'm going to call this person after work." And they get off work at 6 and they call. Now, my call center is closed. So I, you know, again, I'm trying to monetize that call. So why would should a call not be connected? Like, let me connect it and let me see how I can monetize you and help the consumer find what they're originally searching for. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Like I know there's the two different models, very simple, but for like the affiliate game, different people do email capture, right? Name email and then push them to something, right? And then the other guys that just like again not bad way but like the that course for example is literally just ad lander and then you're running straight to ClickBank offer that's you know headline VSSL and then nothing CTA time and it's like you don't have ads tomorrow and that was like my experience right is like you get up and you're spending four or 5k a day and all of a sudden something goes off the rails and then you're like everything's off or you lose an account or something and tomorrow you make zero or you lose, right? You still lose. So, yeah, it's never I've never played the data game in this when I've done my random tests and all that kind of stuff. It's always been just like a in the- moment conversion or nothing. Um, so yeah, interesting. It it hit me. Um, good friend of mine, Ron Hart. Shout out to Ron. He uh he's a big data guy, right? You wouldn't think if you saw him, you wouldn't think he's a data guy, but he's a huge data guy, right? And he said something to we were we were talking and stuff like that and he said something to me that is like hit me right. He goes like listen I'm just trying to make $3 to4 per optin per month. Okay. And when when he said that it was like wow cuz that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money right? If you're making three to four dollars per person that opted in every month, you know, and you have like 200 million people in his case, you know, that's cuckoo money. I'm not saying that he's doing that, but that's the goal, right? The goal is is to build your own firstparty data and be able to monetize it. So each optin generates your company, you know, three, four, five bucks a month. I don't want more than that. Just three, four, five bucks a month. If you do that every month, you know, it it compounds on his cuckoo money. That's nuts. Yeah, I've never heard of it framed like that. I mean, I talk about on here sometimes. The very first internet marketing thing I did was essentially build a list, right? Like that was the I bought some I got on a webinar, didn't know it was a webinar, bought a $497 course, and the traffic source was Instagram shoutouts. So, you put a graphic up with link in bio. you paid 200 bucks like DMs and then they would send it to the link and it was some random I don't even remember what it was like bounce or unpaid or something at the time and uh it was optin and then the as the redirect you just put it as a clickbank link that was in the niche that was their whole model and it was like you just selfquidate the cost of what you paid for the shout out but I built this list of like 20,000 people and that was the same model except theirs was a dollar it was like you need to make at least a dollar a month per subscriber and I was such a rookie and there's no AI so I couldn't 80% of the way there with copywriting. Like I didn't know how to do it. I didn't know how to email the list. I didn't know how to do any of that stuff. But like, you know, the number in the affiliate game used to be a buck. They've said it's been lower. But I have heard that you now that you say that, I've heard people say it's two, three, four bucks depending on what vehicles you're using and if or what monetization methods you're using with different form fills, different uh call, you know, going direct to and having those. I hear some of these guys on X talk about like the cact difference of some of these like uh like GLPs and like that kind of game and like there crazy. It's crazy. And same stuff when you start to get into some of the higher ticket like financial services stuff and and different paper call. Yeah, the GLP1s are crazy and it's so easy to put together. Yeah. Like compoundingies everywhere. You can look into like 503 A's or B's and then you get like a doctor network that will do your ecripts and that's it. Run it, baby. Do you do any Do you do any ecom anymore? Uh, no. Um, I still kind of like consult for a gaming share company. So, we used to do a lot of ecom back in the days. Um, and then you know we do like kind of like the gaming chair that you're sitting on. So yeah, but no, not anymore. Yeah. I I just recently when Jason uh Jason A uh started posting about some of his stuff like I guess I didn't realize at the time about his like branded or what's it called? Uh um affiliate ecom. I guess I just didn't even know about that game because that's not super common on some of like the beginner networks at least that I knew of. everything was always either some info product or some like sub supplement through a ClickBank or one of whatever those networks. But that was an interesting model to me too. It's like being able to just create assets for those marketing side of things and be able to run to that and like the economics being how he kind of explained it is super interesting to me. Um yeah, it is. Jason's a great guy. Yeah. I wish I can get him back into paper call. Is he out? Doesn't want Is he out now? No, he's just, you know, it's a love and hate relationship. Yeah, he's been in the chat talking about things for sure. But he's Yeah. Yeah. We had a good run. We had a good run. But, you know, he he does very well with with the stuff that he's running. Dude, he'll message me about something and I'll be like, "What?" Like, he'll ask me a question about this or that and then about because I do the info coaching, call funnels, do you know in house team that it's just like same world but like completely different pockets. Um, and he'll ask me a question. And I'll be like, "For what?" And he'll be like, "Oh, this and this." I'm like, "What do you mean you're involved in that? Cuz aren't you involved in that and that?" And he's like, "Oh, yeah. And that." I'm like, "Dude, I love it." Like, he's just constantly in it. Constantly. It was You have to be delusional and addicted in order to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's definitely With that being said, I really enjoy it, but I got to get ready. I got to jump for another one, I'm sure. So, all right. So, people find you where? I mean, obviously they find with your name. You're everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. just Carlos Corona as you just search Carlos Corona paper call and you can find me everywhere. My YouTube has tons of free content. Uh each of those videos is close to an hour plus when I used to do Moneym Mondays and you have like literally over a 100 hours of free paper call training. No gatekeeping, showing my ad account, showing my funnel, showing everything that's in YouTube. It might be a little outdated, but the same principle applies. um on X. I've recently joined X again and I've been talking [ __ ] and [ __ ] posting non-stop there. So, and on Instagram, uh 305 Shark and then Telegram is Carlos Corona Jr. and reach out. I'm I'm I'm looking to connect with other, you know, affiliate marketers and digital marketers out there and see what we can build together. Yeah, 100%. I cannot echo that more. We didn't get into a ton of tactical stuff on here, but I've watched him and he'll go for an hour straight on anything tactical in any which direction about I would love to. You do. You already do. I would love to. But but I literally have to get ready to No, no, you're good. You're good. You're good. All right. Well, I'll talk to you. All right. We We need a part two. How about that? We need a part two where we just eat something alive. We launch one from scratch and then we just watch it live. Let's do it. Let's Let's do something live. I'm down. I got the domain. All right. Let's do it. Cool. Thank you so much. All right. Bye. price.
