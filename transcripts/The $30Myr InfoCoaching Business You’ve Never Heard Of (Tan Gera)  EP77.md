# The $30M/yr Info/Coaching Business You’ve Never Heard Of (Tan Gera) | EP77
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rK7D3sUVvM

What's up, guys? All right, on today's video, we are 77 days into doing this, and we've got Tan Gira. Jira, how do you say that? Gira. I'll let him share who he is, but he was one of the first person to reach out to me when I started doing some of his content and connect with some killers that I did not know existed. Um, so he's been extremely instrumental in helping with things for talent for us, different things around the funnel structure. But I'll let him kick it off. So, Tan, who are you? Well, uh, Tanganger, French guy, born in the suburbs, eventually made out, right? Made it out of the suburbs. Uh, Indian descent. I lived in a few countries, ex-wall street banker. That's not often, you know, uh, the case in our industry. And eventually, I saw the light. I was like, I'm just a slave right now. And I saw behind the curtains of, you know, what's actually happening happening in the banking industry. And I got very hooked into crypto. Uh did very well with my own investments, created a network, met my co-founder, Salem, and we were like, you know what? I think people need this. People need education. Uh there's a lot of scams and all these things out there. So we launched 3 years ago, tight-knit community kept getting bigger. Yeah. Uh many things happen, right? They tried to cancel us, etc. But we made it this far, so we're doing well. It's cool. Decentralized is the company. Yeah, I was going to say, so let's go into that real quick. So you guys are how what do you categorize that? So it's info, coaching, education. What's the info coaching? Uh coaching. I don't like coaching here because it's more like hands-on deep mentorship. You know, the difference between like a product like ours markets run every single day and what was true yesterday isn't true today, right? So you need that constant flow of information to know what's happening in the market, have a system, have a strategy. And what we did is we took my CFA, you know, um, charter experience, all the strategies that are used in Tradfi and we brought it to crypto, which was never the case. In crypto, you only had those DJens, right? Yeah. Uh, that just trade without any strategy. We created our own. Um, I did well with it and now we teach it. Interesting. Okay, cool. Yeah, cuz I looked into you guys after you first reached out to me and it seems that you're definitely the I don't know the right word, but like boutique uh very educationbased, very like in that direction versus kind of the market and I only know this world like so well, right? I mean, I've bought it for, you know, a lot of years and just held it and lost and won and done my thing, but I've never like deep delved into trading strategies or what to hold or when to set like nothing. And so, um, you guys do what? It's around everything. Is it main? Is it just big cap? Is it just this? Is it active day trading? Is it like We do everything. We cover the whole spectrum of digital assets. I'm not even going to say crypto because now the scope is much bigger, right? Our name is decentralized masters. It's not crypto masters. Yeah. Why? Because we knew at least we bet on the fact that everything was going to go decentralized and onchain. It was going to be a whole decade of transition which I think we're in the middle of right now. Yeah. Like I started in 2016 first. So for me it's already been nine years and yet we're still early you know. Yeah. So we just had this belief once you have this core belief that everything's going to go there you just want to stick to it. And so what we do is three-step. One is deep uh video training where we show how like where to click what to do right on our strategy. We educate people. So it's like building a portfolio, the right allocations based on your risk profile, who you are as an investor because in investment there is no oneizefits-all. Yeah. Yeah. So we literally take what some wealth managers do and we apply that to our members like they go through a lot of understanding of who they are and what they need. Uh what level of risk they can take on and based on that they get like um tailored like allocations on how they could approach the market. Of course it's up to them. So that's the first thing right the planning. If you don't have a plan you're going to fail. Then the second part is as I said every day it changes. Every day there's something happening and so like you know Trump comes in with tariffs. How does that impact my strategy? It does. So you have hands-on mentorship and we had to go and find the best of the best out there and that's tough because they're they're making a killing with crypto themselves. Yeah. But what we figured is that there's a lot of them that value two things. One is having a community and shared resources of people who do the same thing to have b bounce off ideas, right? And the second thing is they just I mean crypto is lonely, right? So they just want to be part of like something bigger. They want to understand the vision and uh they help they they help our members because they love this and they want to pass it on. They want to teach it. Yeah. So let's get into that portion. So fulfillment because I was curious about that. So it's community groupish kind of coaching or is it I mean you don't have to go into exact like cost and pricing and everything but is is that the general offer stack so it's like they get access to a community it's groupish coaching obviously you just said there's how and like implementation stuff which I would imagine is done through like pre-recorded like what's the what's the structure of that three-step right video training step by step second is like one-on-one mentorship or group mentorship depending on what tier you're getting at because there are different tiers Some people want more hands-on support, some people want less. Uh, and then the third aspect, which is super important, is community. So, we have a massive community of like 3,000 plus members who are all very high profile, right? We don't take any anyone um who needs credit, etc. We we don't accept that because crypto is risky in a certain way and we don't want anyone to take an amount of risk that they can't withstand, right? So we just we have to pay more to acquire customers, but they stick because they have the means to do it. They have the willingness to do it. And so we can't just take anyone's money. We can't. Yeah. 3,000 members is no joke. What's the What's the stack? Where do you guys put them right now? Or like where do they live? Uh we circle circle community. Do you? Yeah. Okay. You'd think I mean that's hilarious. I I talked to everyone about all these. It's I mean it's school, it's circle, it's [ __ ] it's depending on your industry, maybe even like Discord, it's like you know there's all these different ones. I mean doesn't doesn't everyone hang out on Discord still or is that dead for the level of sophistication of our market and the investors we have? Discord is not the right place. Discord is for web three native young dudes, right, who understand what crypto is and like all this world like the Telegram and Discord stock is for crypto natives. But our our customer base is not that. So for them, you know, even probably Facebook group would have made sense, but they didn't have the enough functionalities, but that's where they live. Interesting. Okay. So you have the older yours is older demo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's super nice. And then so you don't do any financing and then we'll break into some fun stuff. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. We rolled the first time we did it was last year. We had never done it either and we just did like the internal version of like pay plans and stuff which is like kind of financing but not really like no actual credit plans. Never. You you what? We almost never do payment plans. That's crazy. And you guys are I don't know if you want to talk numbers, but you guys are 10 20 50 or like in those bigger numbers, right? You're not sub 10K. Uh you mean by price point? Yeah. We're very high ticket. Yeah. That's awesome. That's so fun cuz then you're I mean you already said it, but like the sticky and the quality and all of that. Like yes, you have to bite it a little bit on customer acquisition costs, but like if they stay for a while and they're actually legit and it's like a true bread community, it's like I just saw you pop into that one chat, they use WhatsApp and they're in there and it's like it's kind of hard to navigate. But that's the same thing. It's like I bet that churn is going to be so low because it's just like high quality people that are, you know, we're going to an event for it. Like those guys are killers and they all like just want to hang together and are willing to pay to play. It's so funny because like that example you can just like you could have just put everyone in a group chat but because there was someone who centralized it and put all the stuff around it it like it bodess the higher ticket right no I mean the you know coming back to your question about circle is it great no we'd rather have our own like app we're working on it uh we're going on software as we speak right and we eventually want to bring everything there. Yeah. But does it do the job for now? Yeah. Yeah. So, you haven't said, but the reason you stuck out to me is your numbers. So, do you talk about what you guys did last year or anything like that? Yeah, we did 30 last year. Yeah. So, we did 32 and I had literally had no idea you guys existed. And that's my own ignorance. And also because I think you guys are so high ticket that doesn't require as much necessarily volume. So, even if you're crushing it, hitting those numbers, it doesn't it doesn't require as much as many eyes on it, right? You don't need as many impressions to get that kind of when when your model works out to how you guys do for monetization. That's Yeah. So, like what happens with because last year I'm trying to remember last year was hot, right? Last year was in for your market. It was new all-time highs. It was all that. Like does it follow that trend? We just hit three months where no one was talking about it at all or whatever it was or they were but just negatively. Like how does that work? Uh it's funny you ask. I computed and it's very unfortunate. It tells you a lot about market psychology. So I computed a bitcoin uh average price performance like chart and then I tried to compare it with our enrollments right. Yeah. And there is correlation and it's because you know what when it drops is the best moment to get in and all these people that get in at this moment and when our because what happens then is you want to tell your membership directors right your the people who gatekeep and enroll. You want to tell them, "Guys, now it's now where you have to convince them because they're gonna have like everyone's gonna make a killing because the overall market is good, right?" Uh, but these people especially, so now is the time like push, but you also don't want to push. So, it's it's a battle. Yeah, that's interesting. I think about that that like, you know, your interest levels are down, but it's truly best buying opportunity or, you know, should be the best at least, you know, fundamentally should be. That's interesting. I would Yeah, I wouldn't think about it like that. So, you guys run what like what funnel stack? I mean, do you do I don't think I've seen low ticket stuff. I I know we kind of brief talked about that, but you guys do VSSL funnel classics, you guys do webinars, you do groups, like what's your play? We do um Okay. 99% of our revenue has come from VSSL, but we've seen uh that a few times just changing your way of approaching people can work. And so we've done a couple webinars here and there, but it's very specific, right? If there's something very special we want to talk about, there's the date, there is a FOMC meeting where we know there's going to have an impact and we know that people are going to be thankful that we did it because they came through this, they're going to get the results. We're like, "All right, let's do it." But otherwise, we like the evergreen type because we're very focused on the back end, like the retention and the software play. Not as much as like we don't need such a big acquisition like you know uh push all the time because our retention rate is insane. Like people just stay. It's like insane. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. When when you and I started first talking that was one of the first things that I was like oh yeah that's like a leaky bucket situation that we have for sure. Like we're on the hamster wheel of acquisition, but when it crushes like it just feel it's just the dopamine hit of just like inflow inflow inflow and you don't even for us like we didn't even I didn't even have dashboards. I wasn't even tracking the back numbers like I saw them and I knew they were happening but like not at the level nowhere near the level 5% of the level I did with the front end metrics. So I'll I'll tell you something funny like you know during this whole Trump situation what happened is the fear and greed index in the overall market went to as low as four out of 100. And I'm not talking the crypto if you're in greed like I'm talking about overall market sentiment. Right. And so people just didn't want to buy anything and especially not an investment high ticket product. Yeah. Right. So of course our front end suffered but because our back end is so strong and like customers just renew and renew and renew and keep renewing. uh most competitors in crypto office either got wiped out or just paused their ads and they were like let's wait and we were fine. Yeah. And that's the moat that we built because we started before anyone else like in the market we're literally I think the longest standing by far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, once I looked I mean once we started talking I looked into the guys I remember doing this that would do the pretty aggressive VSSL like not compliant in the slightest VSSLs but they were like pretty sizable. It's not like they were like some ClickBank offer and you know no [ __ ] on them but like they were a legit OP but they were going so hard on DR like so hard um that I don't know I don't necessarily see out of your guys' stuff like of course you have direct response but not at the level that's like that. And then you said something earlier. You said the how did you frame it? The like it's lonely. So do you see that you get referrals that you do get that stuff or because they don't know anyone in their space? This is where they come to it more so than like they're around the water cooler and it makes sense to refer somebody into the community. So we've had this discussion with so many members and they all say look like I referred but I gave so many disclaimers myself because look for this kind of demo right they made the choice to get in and often time what happens is they brag around with their friends you know playing golf or something saying hey I made the move I went into crypto etc and they get asked a lot of questions right on how how did you learn about all that and it's because They're part of our community. Yeah. But they always say, "Look, like I'm always hesitant because what if I tell them to join and tomorrow they don't apply what you guys teach and they get crushed? It's going to be on me." So, we do have referrals. It's like 10% of our revenue, which is fine, right? Fine. Yeah, that's great. No, it's fine. But we didn't really push on that because we just got that resistance of people saying, "Look, and I'm being very honest, right? Like they say, I love you guys. I'm going to renew, but I just don't want to put myself in a situation where if it doesn't work for someone else, then I'm like, "Yeah, sure. Cool." Because it's crypto, right? Yeah. No, no. I mean, I get it. Ours is when do you do it? Is the biggest question for us because it's like, okay, if you're trying to get a referral on the way in, which is like a very common practice for a lot of people. It's like, oh, you know, just get in like now who are your three friends you want to refer cuz you're in the high of joining. But like are, you know, with the transformation and very focused around the transformation and why they're buying it for the result. It's like the only frame you can use that really works in our my opinion and probably completely wrong for other people, but like is you're getting accountability, buddy. You're getting someone to be like in the trenches with you and do it with you because you have no result. You have no, you know, you're buying some future thing that you have not achieved. So like the only way you're going to do that is to bring someone with you. And then the other one is systematizing whatever you want to call it the feedback loop of like NPS or like uh testimonial or something that on the tail of that it's like oh they had this win oh they hit XYZ result or portion of the results on the journey now try and trigger them to get reviews or either reviews or referrals and we still haven't mastered it like what's your first win your path to first win for us? Yeah. It's that's the thing it's not standardized like we're doing a whole new data thing like we have MPS we have these different like we have different structured of setup of when we get feedback in the beginning heavily right for like those initial activations so those have a ton of feedback on them and then they do get routed based on where they land with NPS where they land with some of the check boxes like what bucket they sit in and that crushes but for it's a whole process right because it's like identify who they are first so like that should do that that they got the win the next piece is like what is the literal communication method or what is the offer that they can then push. So is it, you know, if you get three people, you get yours free. Do you get an extension on it? Do you get literal cash? Do you get like, you know, what is the offer that someone gets for referring someone or is there no offer? It's just they literally love it so much they feel like they cuz that's the dream state, right? Is like someone is like so over the top about this that they just like refer someone with no comp or no offer. But you're going to make an offer. So for us, I think it's right now the one that they're testing is three for free. So it's basically you get like you know whatever that is four months for free and an extension on top of your thing for every person you refer that pays. Um and then from there in fit because in fitness look typically so do you know uh you probably know Dan Martell right? Yeah. So there's this book software as a service and yeah you probably have it right it's good and because you know we're in software so I was reading it and what I liked is when they talk about optimizing everything for the first win. So for a software it can be like that one activation point whatever that is for you guys it could be lost 1 kg anyone once you lost 1 kg just post a picture and that's the you know the first step if they do that everything else will be easier right the one thing for us u what we've seen is that people start either you have some big money gamblers that start with like a million right up front and you our mentors are like yo yo yo chill chill chill you know and you have like um some other people who start small which we recommend and so it's very difficult to standardize. So what we had to do is we we we broke down the program into steps. Our step three is what we call our once you finish our step three, it's called the first win and there's always a quiz to pass it to open up the step four and so we can see right we calculate how long it takes them to finish step one, how long it takes them to finish step two and we keep incentivizing the team on being on literally on their ass like calling them to make sure that that time is like you know um less and less and less and we get to the step three as fast as possible because we know that if they finish step three within the first 30 days, they're going to renew. And the step three is what is like getting their whole portfolio set up and getting a first passive income stream running for them with profits coming in. Yeah. And so we know if they do that in 30 days, there's no chance they're not going to stay because they see it happening. They see the money coming in. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be what amount. It's just the action of it. The action of it. Yeah. when you you seriously were the one who opened my mind directly to like just even around the data around this or like your guys' back end and I was we started to dive into it and I think I talked to you but we hired a company to come in and basically do like all the data fulfillment automation restructure of all of that starting with product because we have so many client wins that come in. And we have so many people that like we basically tear it like there's internal so there's like reviews. So reviews the the top creme de creme or let's flip it on its side is the other the the one that has the most volume is like a textbased review. So someone drops it in either communication with the coach they drop it in the Facebook group they drop somewhere those get captured. That's the highest one. The next one is like before and after photo right and basically just like results there. And that one's a little less but still a ton of them. There are so many of those. And then the next tier is the selfie video testimonial style where they Yeah, I do too. And right and those have shown to be the highest performer for like someone who's in the middle or kind of colder. And then the next one and the highest one is an interview. So we do a onetoone interview with brand expert or brand face of company and those people and they like line up out the door to try and get an interview and do that. And they do like a long form 45 minute one of these like where were you stuck, what happened and those the one when those get consumed it's like you got a buyer in two seconds, right? So that's like our tier of those and how we trigger those is just this mess. But we get so many of them that they just fill this like client wins channel we have. We're like grabbing this one, trying to pull this one. I'm doing like batch uploads. Like there's not a system around it. So in the next iteration on what we're building now is like how do we structure that? What are those activation points or whatever you want to call them? When we do that, what actions do we want to take? So is it get a testimonial review or is it get a referral or is it what? And then I don't have the numbers to tell you like, oh, if someone submits a client wins thing or they submit this, how likely are they to renew? Like I don't know those numbers, which is crazy. But like that is the total direction that we're headed because now it's like if we can do this round fulfillment, we don't have to be we're always going to be some crazy direct response acquisition machine. We always will be. It's like just in our blood. But if we can keep them and do that, it's like, you know, that's that's fire and gasoline. You see, it's funny because uh it really depends on who you are as an entrepreneur, I guess. Uh it's true because I come from you know the the corporate like environment and so I've seen all these things like everything is structured even to the point where I get very pissed when my team uh doesn't doesn't have a proper naming convention on files or ads or you know and I teach them because in the banks I mean we would get hammered if we we you know didn't do that right because it's normal I I'm part of a 10,000 employee organization So I brought that and my co-founder, he's more direct response. He scaled big ecom stores like big big numbers. And so it's really about what you care about, what you've learned. Like that's that's the thing. Yeah. What's your guys' What's your guys' dynamic? So you're then more structure tech, but like are you both expert? Is one the ads and one's not? Like I don't know your guys' dynamic. We've been very agile. Very agile. uh when we started he took on marketing I took on sales we we understood that you know it's a whole new thing you have to sell on the phone and so I took the first 50 uh enrollments myself and then we brought someone in so we delegated sales I became manager so I had to learn first sales then because my background is investments right and finance then I had to learn sales sales management then I went back to fulfillment to fix it, right? Once it got big enough that it's the the focus and we have to update everything from fulfillment, I went to um more like how to become a better manager and leader. Been working on that a lot and now I'm back to marketing with him. Interesting. Now only now because we need innovation. It's it's that time, you know. Yeah. But also I built the uh renewal engine. Yeah. How do how do we do that? That's the thing that I I built from the ground up. Yeah. We're talking about hiring for that. Like we exact same situation is what you just said is like we literally were doing the sales calls, then we were managing a sales team and onboarding them all. Then we were, you know, like up the we can go on forever, but now the newest thing was like we need seale and like proper management of marketing. We solved for that, but then you have the ramping period and like catch up and where is everything and how do you guys do it versus how do we want to do it and where's the line and like all that stuff. Got that then it was sales. It's still sales but now I'm like I'm teed up and I'm like all right it's fulfillment but within fulfillment the issue the initial piece is it doesn't have the data. So building all that getting the data structured getting the automations getting the fulfillment standard like in all those ways that then we can iterate on the kind of inbetweener which is the retention and like continuation of that that that renewal engine but that's super interesting. So you guys said you have so the the monetization models are recur I mean you have recurring community access info all that but then you also have software you said yeah we literally just launched that uh and it's funny it's one of our top members who sent us an email one day um literally one year into you know the business and it has scaled and I get this email that says hey I'm an ex uh lawyer and my focus was estate planning. And by the way, hats off to you guys. You helped me make a lot of money in crypto. But what if I die tomorrow? That's the email by a member. And as I told you, our demo is like older. Yeah. I was like, "Holy [ __ ] I didn't think about that." You know, and so what happens is we kind of ignore it because we're scaling the business. We have a million things to do. I'm like miles away from thinking about that. But then eventually when you remove yourself from everywhere, everything's working well, your members are happy, you're like, "Okay, what's the next problem?" Go back to the parking lot of ideas. Yeah. And and what one day I remember there's a meeting of my renewal team that actually talks to people all the time, all the members, and they say literally it comes up on 50% of those calls. Like they're saying, "Hey, but what if something happens to me? how do I pass it on to my legacy to my hairs and so we're like all right let's do it and so we built I mean we looked at the market what's happening is there anything good out there they might be a couple solutions but they're not great and they definitely don't have the distribution they don't have that we have they don't have the user uh the customer you know the user base so is it so it's built internal so so no or you're trying to make it standalone It's standalone product because initially Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be um driven by, you know, the info and so our existing member base, but eventually it will be um public. So, we hired separately. We just did it on the side. Nice. Yeah. Uh Brooke who I talked to on here whatever x amount of days ago he they built one and it basically is it does he says it basically can't stand alone right now but it still pumps out six month six uh figures and be and like they're not going to leave right it's sticky. It does all these things except for the fact that like it doesn't really stand alone in itself. So the only acquisition for it is from his customers which still works. It's just like another monetization model. It just is like he he was basically saying it wouldn't be a standalone. But you guys are building this thing full on to be standalone. Yeah, because look um you know we started this business, we had money already thanks to our investments. He was he did great in business. I did great with my investments. And so we built the business a bit differently. We had this whole vision in mind before we started. And so that's why we went very very quick into like building the fulfillment machine because there was always that play at the end. The only thing we didn't know was okay we knew that we were going to solve the first problem that is education now in the crypto market but we understand the adoption curve and we understood that eventually it's going to go mainstream and so when it goes mainstream what is going to be the next problem to solve either you've helped people make a lot of money they understand it and now they're willing to let you manage it so one avenue was an investment fund and all my background is there right so I could do that or the other avenue is software and valuation game because if you want to reach exactly in the valuation game yeah I mean let's be honest like I I I would like to be a billionaire right and so to do that you have four sources of you know the four seas of leverage content we're using it with decentralized masters we're gathering eyeballs with content and then we're giving them content as well uh collaboration. So workforce, we have a massive workforce. I think less than you, but we are like 90. That's a flex. That's a good thing. Oh, I know. Do the math, everyone. If we're doing the same amount and he has less team and then you have the two missing pieces, code and capital. The beautiful thing that we realized and why we went for the software instead is our whole product is centered around capital. It doesn't have to be our capital. Mhm. Our members have the capital. It's in the billions. Our member base, right? So, if we build with code that is within the investment like area. Yeah. I know you're in a honeypot. What? So, I don't know if you want to go deep into like what the software is or the idea behind it, but like either that or what other monetization plays are even on the board cuz you said it was like software or a fund or c in that way, but like how big can this thing go or is that the goal of it? Oh, massive. We're I mean our goal, our big hairy ass goal or I don't know how you call it is uh the top 10 crypto companies in the world and we want to be the one everything app where people get in they see their whole portfolio they can buy there they can ensure their whole holdings there right the legacy because if something happens to them boom it goes straight to you know it's called proof of debt, etc. Yeah. And then it goes to their kids or whoever. Um, no lawyers, no third party, no middleman, etc. And they can invest in a fund right there as well. They have an AI assistant that tells them, "Hey, your holdings are not like what was supposed to be in your investment plan. Are you sure you want to, you know, buy this memecoin?" Yes, I am. Um, yeah. No, that's interesting. So, you got, so that's the goal is to do all those eventually, but like, you know, stairst step your way through. It's info coaching right now, whatever you want to whatever bracket you want to call it. It's software as this next play that can be serviced for or that acquisition is done through client base but can be standalone and then get its own inflows as its own standalone thing and then in addition potentially some version of fund or like capital management that occurs on the tail. You basically flipped the model on its head, right? Like for ages Silicon Valley was let's give like 50 million to this kid and let's see where he you know where where he lands. And the new model is you build an audience, you build a community, you give them tremendous value so that they trust you and then you serve them the product that they ask you and literally that product it's our customers who asked it like they said can you build this? We're like all right let's do it. Now the the the legacy part of it right like u the insurance part of it is just the way to after reading that book software as a service we realized it's the way to eliminate churn because no one knows by definition when they're going to die. Yeah. So they wouldn't cancel that subscription but then that's crazy. Yeah. I mean I get it. Yeah. But then you don't retain them that way. You want to expand that revenue. Right. How do you do that is by giving them like addictive services allin-one and where it gets magical because some people might say what happens in the bare market that is coming you know cryptocycles etc. Well, today digital assets, it's not only crypto. You can buy gold, tokenized gold, you can buy tokenized real estate, you can buy tokenized stocks, you can buy tokenized bonds. And so what we want to do is we want to bring all investment vehicles in under one platform. And you don't have Robin Hood account and then a brokerage here and then everything in one place tokenized. Interesting. Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, I I'm not privy on a lot of this, right? Like, I I understand I hear the things and what's early and what's actually in adoption and what, you know, adoption to us looks like versus what it actually looks like in the real like world versus our little pocket of internet marketing or crypto guys or whatever. Like, that's it. So, I think of Luca, right? And my example of like someone who took this kind of up the ladder of how far you can take something and his plans are always just crazy. and you know, I haven't talked to him in whatever couple months, so I'm not sure where he's at with it, but like he went from community info, whatever you want to call it, group uh about this to then buying NFT collection to then, you know, tokenizing it to doing the million things he did where he then brought it to physical products. He did all that and then next iteration is like has his own chain, right? Uh what did you know do you guys see yourself because right now that's it's not necessarily like you know the axes and shovel or whatever they call it like where you're just doing it like around the industry but kind of right it's like a little it's kind of so do you have any goals of anything that's specific to crypto itself like you guys have your own cuz right there like I I'm viewing this kind of and tell me I'm completely wrong because I can be but I'm viewing it right now where you're trying to build it around like things that already exist and you're bringing them together. you're adding on service layers or software as a service layers to things that already exist and kind of like supporting around it versus maybe being like XYZ utility actual coin or chain or whatever or XYZ you know I don't know the game well enough so I'm just trying to I'm just curious but uh I wouldn't discard it completely but I also wouldn't say that it's a focus because here's the thing I wouldn't want to build a token just for the sake of building a token Yeah, agreed. If I don't understand myself what value would have and bring, there's no point. Yeah. No, no, completely agreed. But it's interesting. You see the guys do it. You see the guys that I mean and it's all shortsighted. So obviously good that you guys haven't in order to just make it whatever a million bucks or three or whatever. It's like for what? Yeah. So I I want to go against that, right? I know that I'm going to be in the game of business for a very very long time. And so my reputation is everything. I'd rather just say no to short-term cash and like build confidence in what we do, who we are for a long long time. And I know that someday we'll reap the rewards. Look at Trump. The guy is a billionaire, right? And at 70 what? Six he becomes a president and then suddenly makes billions in like a few hours. Yeah. Yeah, I'm still pissed about that still. I'm still to this moment extremely annoyed by that. I was literally on my computer sitting there when it was at 900 and was like, "Oh no, it looks fake." And I just sat there and just watched it climb. Just watched it climb. I knew guys who were like dumping, you know, swapping from ETH over as much as they possibly could put in it. And I'm just like looking at the chart just like I missed it. Yeah, it was like 1:00. It was like 12. It was midnight 1:00 a.m. Eastern. And I just happen to be sitting here and just on when everyone's talking about it and I'm like just missed it. I know guys who literally made like you know nothing. You told me you round trip to Moonme coins, right? Oh my god. I have roundt thousands of soul thousands in 150 chunks. Like I literally if you It's so funny. I'm in I'm in some of these random like back chats and there's some guys that stood out to me and I paid the whatever two soul or 10 soul or whatever at the time just to like get in the game and just see what everyone's doing and then quickly found that my game is find the 10 to 30k like brand new launch game and like a meme scope on Photon or something like that. It's just like more fun for me. I don't know how to do it once it's already at a million and let it ride. I don't know what's going to stick. I don't know how high they can go. Like I have no idea. But if I can ride the 15k to whatever or like 10 to 30k ones to a couple million on that first big kick, like I have three coins on there I can right now off the top that I'm the number one trader on that I, you know, got more for my two soul buy and pulled out 250 or 300 or whatever on multiple occasions, but I have hundreds of times that I have taken it up to 50 in profit or 75 or 150 is like the joke is my number. I get up to 150 and then I start trying to like sell chunks out and then it starts to dip and I'm like, "Oh, wait." And I basically sell like five or 10 from two and leave 150 on the table and just rides to zero. Like so many times I cannot tell you. It's like, "Oh, we'll just sell half on the way up or do this and like lock in whatever." I'm like, "No, I have I have ridden it up past 100 and then back down and lost my uh principle like so many times. It's just not my game. It's not my game. I do it for fun. I sit here. where I plug in for 12 hours on like a random day when we don't have anything. I haven't done that in a minute, but you're most likely going to do it again. Yeah, it's fun, dude. It's fun. I mean, yeah, I turned in the count with like whatever 30 or 50 or something sold I put in there to like 500 and something. I hit two in a two in 24 hours or 40 or whatever it was. Basically, it was oneish, one and a half, two days, call it, where I turned a two into 200 and something and I turned like a three or four into 300 and something and like went from like basically 10 soul in one account to like 550 and then across the next month I basically sent it back down to 50. See, I have like some of my educators who are like that, right? But that's that's what they do. And they teach that to some members because they have that, you know, uh gambling money. They love it. I am out of this. I do not do it. Yeah. I don't touch NFTs. I don't touch memes. I don't do it. Yeah. Only NFTs I've ever dubbed on are the is when because I was working with Luca prior to him buying them and like it was just working on the street type thing and I was like, "Okay, whatever." Picked up a couple. It was like 1.5 and I bought two, rode those up, got the airdrop, did everything, you know. So, made whatever it was 30x the money on there. Didn't sell anything. Didn't even sell the coin even on the airdrop. Didn't sell the coin. So, the thing's worth whatever 200 and something. rides it down to like hold on till dear life, right? Yeah, but like am I like I just don't I I don't have I have no plan. Let me ask you this like what do you think about the crypto market? Where is it going to go? Give us right now. Oh my god, I'm the wrong person to ask this question. I I will stand I will stand on my ignorance. Why I'm asking because I want to understand what the general like you know people thinks the I mean I I look at Bitcoin you know I look at how I looked at in the beginning and in the beginning it was oh find the things that aren't the core thing and where you can make more. You know, that's that's the general sentiment is on altcoins, you're going to make this multiple in comparison to this core one that's only going to go up by x amount without realizing the core one, you know, Bitcoin going up x percentage is still massive in compared to other things, right? It's still multiples in compared to like a normal market or a normal whatever. So, like I'm I'm pretty sure I've never bought Bitcoin. Like, never. You're making a massive mistake. Of course I am. I know. And that's what I'm saying. It's like I'm pretty sure I've literally like when we end this call, please do me a favor. Go and buy Bitcoin. I have a lot of ETH, which is just the comical thing of this entire thing is like I always had a bunch of ETH and just kept buying it and it was on my DCAs. It was on my like all my stuff and then some random pockets of other things that I would have that I thought would have actual multiples. Also, this is not a, you know, our come up in like bigger numbers has been the last two or three years. And that was I was also living a different lifestyle at that time to where it was not the long-term focus. It was not the stock it all away. it was the oh, we're just going to continue to make more into the future, which is the dumbest way to look at it possible. And like I learned my lesson there and also living up this lifestyle or this life that was uh had a high burn rate. So like I was spending time there, which also my brain wasn't on doing that stuff. So like my brain's not on, I'm spending it and I'm not thinking about the future. It's like you add those three together and it's like of course I didn't buy it. Of course I wasn't in the position, you know? So whether it was there or not, I mean it was there and I and I was not there, right? So my view on it though is that is that I think it's going you know I think I up and to the right I think the more the standardization I think everything is going to happen. I see people talk how it's going to 10 million a coin. I see people talking how it's going to you know 250 and chilling for a while until it's 5 years from now. Like I have no idea. I get it. I think there's an interesting chapter also is like we're young guys, right? And we we've been successful. Like I think not enough people talk about it, but I see here in Dubai uh young guys make a lot of money. Like all they all like congregate here and they they just spend it all. And I've been there. I've spent I was going to say me too. I'm not I'm not throwing [ __ ] on anyone. It's just No, no, I've been there. I've been there. I've spent a lot of money on stupid [ __ ] Same. Um, but I think it's fascinating how sometimes I talk to people and they say, "Yeah, I'll just make it back." Like I don't if I have too much in my bank account, I'm going to stop and I have to keep going. And I'm like, that's a funny way to look at it. But yeah. Yeah. Cardone talks about like the he gets he empties the accounts or whatever. And that was, you know, these are OG videos that I'm referencing cuz I've watched him for a long time. But like the big empty out the checking account basically and instead of spending it, empty it out, put it into real estate and play that game. So you can't spend it. So you need to continue to work like lighting the fire under yourself that like you don't even have it in the checking account to like make rent or like buy food cuz you're constantly like emptying the checking account. The other the other way to do that is by spending it, not by investing it. And that was like a game I played. I've signed leases where I've been like this is not strategic and smart. and then a month into having the lease like made, you know, multiples of the entire term of it. But like it that's a dangerousing game. That is a dangerous game to play. It is not smart. It is not strategic. You're likely setting yourself up for something that's burning the cash, not investing it, like all those things. And I I worked with uh insurance and I use that as an example in here a lot on like how you can sell info and have these massive backends. And that's an example of like a middle ground backend in comparison to something you guys are talking about. It's like this massive monetization on the back end. His is, you know, you sell info coaching, you can make your multiples on rorowes, you can build your business, but then when people buy insurance, you get like the long tail of that, right? You get commissioned and then you get over x amount of time. You have partnership referrals to things like estate attorneys like this, this, this, like you can make more spiffs across the the thing. But that was one of the bigger things that opened my mind to, you know, everyone talks like compounding, everyone talks that like the whole life insurance game. People do ILS, people do, you know, you there's a million different variations of it, but that idea of and hormones talks about this about like being able to like, you know, the whole be your own bank concept, the infinite banking. There's a lot of variations of this, but that's our angle by the way, be Yeah, I didn't know that. With DeFi, you know, the bankers and I'm an ex banker, so yeah, it works. Yeah. I I mean, I loved the model, but that was the first time I actually started to think like a little bit longer term and be like, "Oh, okay, cool. So if you're just putting 50 grand to this thing a year or whatever number or 500 like that just sits and cooks and the ability to be able to use it to lend against to buy things but then only on you know things that actually have a like a return like just that whole mindset of things I was just never there. I was just like exactly what you said. I'll just make more and it'll continue to make more and why would I never make ever make less. You invest a bit of money though in real estate cuz I'm going to tell you in real estate. No. So I did this game. You shouldn't. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. And I also I also refused to use my skills. It's the worst investment out there. Real estate. It's the worst for what? In terms of returns today. In terms of returns or Yeah, exactly. But again, I don't know enough about this, so everyone's going to torch me in this, but like I have plenty of people in my life that have crushed it with real estate, both in terms of active and passive and the taxation port and like all of it, right? So, I have a bunch of people I know. My thing has been I got back here and now it made sense to do cuz I had basically no taxes where I was for the last x amount of years. So, like didn't make sense at that time to focus on it. I got back here and was like, "All right, maybe I should, you know, put x amount of time or into a bucket where I focus on this for the tax mitigation for that for potential, you know, future, you know, equity builds, longer term thinking." And I started to get into it and I was like, you know what, I am not going to interest map, spend these side quests, do these things on things that will not directly help the main business right now. And that is not a long-term thought. That is not a whatever. That's like a right now what's hot and what feeds the main machine so that the cash flow that comes in is so undeniable and so like then I need to do these other things. Not your unit of time. Where do I allocate my one unit of time for the best return? Yes. And like in the short term it's this and that's for sure in the long term and like you know I don't want to just throw money in a bucket and all of a sudden just start giving it out to you know funds that do this. you can get that honestly you're going to outperform anyone out there be it real estate be it like financial planners be it stock just by buying Bitcoin and also a second thing is you're thinking about the upside think about the downside if tomorrow the dollar gets devalued and it well you need Bitcoin because now now okay I'm I'm I'm changing your way of thinking okay you're making all that cash but it's in US dollars 100% of your net worth is in US dollars Okay. What if the dollar loses half its value? You're Yeah, I I get it. I get it. I also was a guy who was, you know, listening to whatever when it was like, you know, you're the what was it? Your uh inflation is burning the dollar sitting in your cash account, put it all in crypto. And that's when they, you know, gamed the whole thing to send it all freaking to zero at all around the same time. And I was like, you know, I didn't sell anything, so like I was fine, but it was just classic. It was like the classic mania of whenever that was tail end of COVID and when everyone was talking about that. It's just I, you know, I'm just not involved in the game enough. I also, the other one of real estate is the tax portion because you don't have that, right? You don't play. When you mentioned the taxes, I was like, yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. And I also didn't play, you know, I played the different game for a minute and now I'm in a world where or in a loca, you know, I don't know things can change for me in that. And again, right now it's like where should the main focus be? And for me, the main focus right now should be on the generation, should be on the growth of the business, should be on the overall, you know, you go a step deeper is like the actual enterprise, not just cash, not just cash flow month over month. So, we're targeting that, but then it has to be on deck. It has to be because if not, you're literally lighting on fire 50% of it. Um, you're lighting it. Yeah. Which you don't have to play that game. No, cuz you chose not to buy. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, by the way, I watched one of your videos. It was the most insane value ever. It's the We made 683K last week. Yeah. Yeah. And you said something like literally cuz you know I'm going back to marketing now so I had to tell you live. So I watched that full video and you explained how you saw your vision was like three funnels with three angles right and then within the funnel like within the idea like one big idea you're going to have like one optin straight to book a call one DTA and one low ticket. All right. And three angles with three faces. And that removes the founder risk. I think that was so smart that I just took it. I'm going to do the same. That I just took it. I love it. No, dude. I'm so excited for ours. We had a meeting right before this cuz it's what? Yeah. Today is like meeting central. I have like nine meetings, which is hilarious. But the they're launching. So, we're going to we're starting with VSSL only. So, right now we have two VSSLs. I kind of talk about this, but like as I've shifted to where my focus is, it was all on marketing for a minute. It was all on sales. Like my the channel follows what I'm doing on a daily basis because I'm making them every day. So, it's like whatever I'm doing, it's hot on the brain. and I can make a mirror and I can rip like if not I have to like change states but we are doing so right now we have two VSSL optin funnels that are brand face one initial that are running so but two different messaging two different optin pages two different VSSLs we have the same then and you're the brand face on those yeah then we have a low ticket which is brand face one and then we have a DTA which is brand face one that's actually that VSSL is the second of the opt-in VSSLs so same one just different one has a gated one's gated with opt-in and one is direct to app that's the current flow and like what's app operating current state now we're waiting on editors to get the VSSL's back but we have two coming back that are going to be the two different messaging with brand phase 2 and three that are different messaging pockets and like story based and like around that because it's a completely different person so we have the opportunity to leverage different stories different demo different everything so we're going to have four VSSL ops and then just those two core the DTA in to start and then once these ones have traction then they'll get accompanied by an aligned messaging uh low ticket. One question, if one of these new faces slash messaging doesn't work, how will you know if it's the face or the messaging? I already know the faces work because I use them right now towards the main funnels and they work. Mhm. With no continuity. They work. Okay. Because I'm going to tell you something very funny or congruency more so no congruency. So my head of education is a white Caucasian male that resembles our demo and I don't. Right. Yeah. And so my sales sales reps keep telling me why do we keep getting Indians on our calendars because they're very difficult to do business with. And I was like, and then I listened to one of your vid. Is it yours where you say like, no, I I don't think it's yours, but anyway, meta basically matches your face to the Oh, yeah. That's not Yeah, that's not me saying that. But no, I I' I've heard that. I've heard it pulls scripts now fully pulls keywords out like all that. It's crazy. But yeah, the visual of it too. I mean, for so for us right now, we'll run three brand face one, two, and three as ads. We try and do a bit of a pass off. It's like, oh, the free training by Brand face one. and we'll like kind of try and do that. But, you know, people don't make it to this very end of an ad or whatever. They land on a lander that has the opt-in is the brand face one on the image and the thumbnail and then the VSSL is all brand face one. So, it works right now. it crushes right now with those different faces and you're basically looking at the ad metric level because like do they get higher CTR because it's you know you have the same pocket of audience and you have three different brand faces that are basically the same script basically the same whatever and it's like these ones have as higher higher CTRs lower cost per click because they're in the demo and they're in the demo in terms of the age and what they're talking about and how their body looks and all that stuff and fitness in our world but that was a big one for us that we didn't have that you know again and this is all goes to show you're not in you're not your demo. Uh, our Brand Face One and co-founder Rockstar is not in our demo and we did 71 through her, right? Like we did. You don't need it as long as you know it. Yeah. Horosi said something in a video yesterday. It's like someone looks at you and then like is their initial judgment. Sure. But as soon as you start talking, it shifts. And if you know what you're talking about and you're legit and you're this and that and your framing is correct and your edification and all of that, it doesn't matter in my, you know, in my opinion. Um, yeah. So, okay. That's reassuring. It's reassuring. I mean, you just did it. You guys are at what, 50 in total. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And newer and all this. So, we have a race, everyone, publicly. Uh, we're going to hang out in London in a couple weeks, but we have a race that we're not going to talk about what the number is, but just know there's there's going to be a bet included in this and we're going to we're going to gamble. And I love to win. And he loves to win. And uh I generally am pretty quiet about my competition levels, but just know it's real. So, I got to pop in 2 minutes for a legal review meeting, but anything else? We'll we'll do this in person. We'll do another one cuz I think you and I talk all day every day basically. And you and like three other guys that I've met through this that do similar size are like the ones I actually talk to and like consistently have communication with and it's just cool to bounce ideas. You've sent stuff over. I mean, oh wow, I didn't even talk about this, but the talent thing like it has been such a help uh in both directions. Like I've gotten on calls dedicated one-on-one with your marketing tech or whatever you'd call that position for your company and talked shop on how we do things with data and structuring and like split test and HubSpot information and done stuff like that. And then you sent over your cso or world of sales sent over referrals when we were hiring sales and we landed a rockstar all through you. So like yeah, major shout out there and major shout out to the content for then finding us together and then like it's great bro. you opened my eyes and I want to make content now more like less around investment, more around business because talking to you like I've made leaps into where like understanding what I should do and where I should go and again you also shared a lot of things with me. So I mean I just love that like sharing value is dope. Yeah, I was going back and forth yesterday and me sending you that or last week me sending you that SOP and then you sending me that video for Zoom. I got sent that over to our team. They edited one and now we have like a 30 second amazing testimonial reel slideshow that has text on it if they don't turn on audio like the whole thing. And instantly we got like three comments on it already that are like, "Oh, that video is so cool." Yeah. That's from potential clients because all because I joined your Zoom room and saw it. Yeah. Look, there's like when you think about business, right, there's a million small things that you could do and it really depends on like what you get influenced with, what you like, your affinities, what you're thinking about. And so you can't just do it do do them all. You have to pick. Right. Yeah. And so when you talk to uh people in your space that do your size that have the same problems as yours when they tell you it helps you think so well and you're immediately able to tell, okay, for one unit of time here, what will I get back? Worth doing. All right, let's do it. Yeah, I like that thinking. That makes a lot of sense. We'll jam in person. We'll do another one of these. I got to pop. But you're rockstar. We'll talk soon, everyone. That's day 76, I believe, in the books. Bye, guys.
