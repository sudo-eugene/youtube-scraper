# ClickUp + Slack = Our $100M Stack... (Breakdown) | EP63
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcnD53DOiMg

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how to build your execution engine, which in short term just means how to build your lean project management system that does not get in the way and focuses on execution. We're going to go through the big idea and what most people get wrong on this, the core tools that most people use and what we are actually using, the cadence that how to roll this out and then go into the deep dive of the detailed structure we're using on how to manage projects across many divisions all very simply that does not get in the way and things to avoid. All right, this is going to be a good one. Last year, we did 30.5 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 30 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you everything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a cool network of people building cool So, let's get into it. Switched up the color on you guys today after 63 days. It's feeling crazy. So, big idea here. Most of these systems, project management systems, how you manage your projects, how you manage your tasks across divisions and across people in your company, have too many layers. They often have multiple owners. They have no consistent rhythm. They definitely do not get held to a standardized deadlines. And a lot of the time, it ends up being busy work. So, you all know what I'm talking about when we start to talk about you want to launch a new initiative, whether it's a small project or a massive project. Too many chefs in the kitchen, no one clear owner, and it is hard to manage. You try to hire a project manager, you try to hire a COO, someone, they implement all these systems that slow you down. And that is not the goal here. So, we built a lean one. This is real-time building. I will be able to actively update you on how this goes for us and how it evolves. This is V1, which is actually like V6 of us doing this. But I'm in control of it now. And this is how I just built it. So, core tools a lot of people use, ClickUp, Asana, Notion, Air Table, Slack, etc. The ones we have chosen to use is the companies on ClickUp. I'm actually a really big fan of Air Table, but that's just kind of how I think. It's like a spreadsheet more or less. Uh and then Slack for dedicated projects uh or for dedicated channels around projects that are large that need communication around them uh as well as meetings around those. So the cadence for us, I went over this in another uh meet another video one or two ago that talks about how we're going to focus on cross functional and department focused. This is the actual meeting cadence. So the board uh the lists and all that actually operate in this and so do the meetings. So for us, we're going to have a meeting early in the week that is our operations meeting that we've always had and is now going to be focused only on cross functional. So it is going to be higher leverage things. It is going to be projects and initiatives that are companywide that are higher leverage as you have your entire seuite, your highest operating level people. Now this is the scale we are at. Uh at another level I would almost say that cross functional is kind of all of them and you can determine when you need this but we are to a phase and stage where we do need this multiple layers. So cross functional you're going to talk about projects that are all-encompassing. Think about an entire project launch or I'm sorry another a new offering launch. It needs marketing. It needs tech. It needs fulfillment. It needs sale. Like it needs everything. So those will be decided here. They will be talked about, decided and the owners will be assigned out and the sub projects will be department focus. This is going to be something that is like tech for tech, marketing for marketing. Things that do not need to be talked about and wasted of time across all divisions in a cross functional meeting. You do not need to talk deep in depth about low ticket for 30 minutes of an hourong meeting when you have four other people in the room that yes it affects on a company level but not in terms of what they need to do in the project in the decision-m process any of that. So here's how we are rocking. We're going to have one master list and don't think about this like one to-do list but actually one like fullyfledged relational list. Okay? So you're going to have one source of truth and think in like terms of a waterfall and then having subcategories. So there Sharin was a really good one. So look up his stuff. He's had a bunch of good stuff. I don't know if he still sells his but his was essentially going from annual goal to quarterly goal. And these are waterfall is what I mean by this. From quarterly goal then to the monthlies and weekly breakdowns of how they get there. And all it's basically your KPIs as well as the projects are flowing through. So think let's say you want to launch low ticket uh or you want to sell 4,000 low tickets in Q1. Okay. So what needs to happen now in Q1 broken across the months. You need to launch low ticket. You need to uh uh do ideation around the low ticket. You need to do all these different things. You need to go live with it. You need to have setters on the back end. You need sales. You need to have fulfillment on there and CS and supporting. You need the community manager. Like you have the all these pieces and those all get fledged out across those departments. Now how we're doing it in even more in a leaner way. This is our t our task setup. So, one master board and then think left to right. Okay, almost like a spreadsheet but more advanced. You're going to have your project name. It's going to then have a status. It's going to be either open, meaning it's like in the parking lot, an idea, something that we are going to handle but aren't handling yet. And this is the portion that we are going to like talk about during the meetings in cross and in department. Once it is assigned out and it is set to a to-do, it gets a due date and it gets an owner. Okay. Once it's then in progress, this is kind of like multi-week projects. Um, so if you're going to have it, for example, if you're going to have something that's going to last two or three weeks, on that meeting, you need to have it that it's in progress, that it is being done and being worked on, but only moved into there when it is. Um, and then things like, you know, it needs to be done by next day. Those are to-do all the way to completed. Blocked that is occasionally going to happen, and that is when something is stuck uh due to some dependency or some macro change that happens. An example of this is we were going to order merchandise and swag for something. We got it all signed up all basically over the finish line. We're right there. We're about to order and we're like, we just don't need this right now. This is not something that's needle moving. It is a distraction. It is not going to help us right now. So, we just put it in blocked and it'll sit there until every meeting will will quickly cover. Are we ready for this? No, not yet. Okay. Throw a future due date on this and let it sit. Completed is when it is done. Now, again, these will all then have a due date, a submitter, so who submitted it. So, a lot of the time I will submit ideas that I either hear other places or someone says. If I hear someone specifically say it, I will put them as the submitter. And then the champion is who is going to own it. It then falls into a department bucket for us. I have it pulled up over here. The core ones for us right now are marketing, sales, tech, product, and CS. Those are in one because it's kind of for us they're batched together. Finance, and then personnel. Okay. Now, I combine some of these because of how our hierarchy is and who we have as leaders. But you could break these out further or you could also make them a little bit simpler and and batch together. Like I know people who do acquisition for example and that's sales and marketing. Um I know people who include tech and and uh personnel they'll put inside like CS like there there's a lot of different ways you can do this but make it unique to you. And then type for type all you're going to do is for us we're going to do either cross sync or department sync. And what that does is allows you to then create all your filtered customized views using one master list that is applicable just for those departments. So, an example of this, and here's an actual visual of what this will look like on here, right? So, you're going to have your project name. So, in this, you're going to have a renewal offer design. Let's say you're going to have that marked as open because it hasn't been assigned yet. Once it gets assigned to to-do, it'll then get a due date. I was the one who submitted it because I wanted to bring it to the table and have everyone talk about it. The CPO is assigned it because that they are in charge of this renewal offer basically, but it is then and it's a product in CS, but it's a cross sync because it's a renewal offer. It's a complete offer. It's going to need sales scripts. It's going to need tech built around it if it's, you know, for this it's renewal. It's on a back end. So, you need entire tech systems and tracking. It's going to need marketing on how we going to actually create the language around it, the copy, the um any of the assets you need. It's going to include CS. How is the entire fulfillment or I'm sorry, fulfillment and CS, how is it going to have that entire department actually fulfilled on and the group and what what different things they give and like levels of service. So all that all of that would sit in cross sync and then from there it would have projects that break down under it. Now you can choose to either do this as subtasks or tasks under it directly uh or additional tasks I'm sorry and then you would assign those out as department level ones. Okay. So an example I'm looking over here because where I have ours I can't share ours just because I have like I already have 300 and something across every department or across the all and then each department is broken down. So for us I have the all table so I can see everything in one place. I then have a cross table that is only going it's going to have everything that only has cross sync. So these are the things in to-do open I'm sorry to-do in progress open that we will cover on our Tuesday cross sync with all the important leaders all in one place. things like doing a giveaway promo, things like building an entire platform, things like LTV brainstorm sessions, things like companywide chat GPT training, things like qualifying tools, we're talking about using things like changes to sales calls. We're talking like those are bigger things that affect multiple divisions and we need to decide those as a company in one place and those will be cross sync. Okay. Now, the next tab you're going to have on top of there, these are all views of the same data set. Okay. All views the same data set just filtered in different ways. The next one is going to be department specific and that is going to be for for us sales I'm sorry in order tech fulfillment sales marketing. Okay, in that order and that's how we're going to run our meetings. So that's how these are uh filtered across here. And each one of those will have its own to-do in progress I'm sorry in progress to-do open lists and those will be handled in those meetings specific. Now, who avoid who is on these meetings? Right now, it's going to be me and CEO and then is going to be the department lead. It may branch down into having other people in it. But the big benefits of doing this is you will have public visibility. Anyone can click on these different boards and see there's nothing sensitive across here. Nor is there anything sensitive across this level of leadership that we would not share. You're going to have one dedicated owner. There's one person that's responsible for it with a direct deadline and a due date. We have a culture and we have had one that got a little slippery on terms of like oh yeah and then it next this Friday, next Friday and I already said that in a prior video like my big concern on this is our meetings are Tuesday and Thursday. So easily for someone Thursday to be like oh have it be done by next meeting which is the following Tuesday and I'm going to like nip that nip that immediately in the front because that is not cool. We need to have a standardized culture of the champion knows that the due date is when the due date is and we get things done within those or before them. Okay, so that is like a big thing. We're going to have public visibility around that. We're going to have dashboards around that on who the owners are and what their completion rates are. And we're going to focus on outcome over effort. I have a I guess is part of the avoid thing, but I have we have hired two project managers now in the past, both great people. First time we hired a project manager, well, if I go back even further, when we initially hired uh or bought a course that was around this, we were doing like 150 grand a month and we just felt scattered, maybe less, 100 grand a month. We felt so scattered and we're like, "Oh, we need to buy this thing. We need like ops. we need like structure and project management and like I wasn't in a position where I was had skill level or understanding or whatever to do it necessarily and I also was kind of in this mind of like oh we just hire and fix it unless it was years ago and that was wrong. Um I've now come to a realization that I like to get into things and then hire for them kind of after the fact a little bit uh or hire someone who's extremely experienced and again we did not have the skill level to hire them. We did not have the brand authority to hire someone. We did not have the money to hire somebody at that time. So we paid for a course or like a training thing and it was just too early. We did not need systems and structure. It added too much layer and complexity and actually made it harder to get things done and mark them off and like run the system. It was harder to run the system than it was to just get  done, right? So that is like what still what we're avoiding. And then the next time we did it, sameish thing like just coming in and trying to like think of it in this tech mind and do they call it like scrum lists for tech side of things and they're like trying to build out this and this and once it gets into here it goes into review stage and once it's in a review stage it's live and then it's monitoring and whatever and like that has its place for things like tech that has its place for things like marketing does not necessarily have its place for these cross department ones and even then it doesn't right because you have one time you have recurrent projects kind of going on a tangent but like they have different cadences and they do not need to be like beat to death in a project management tool always at scale yes like you need a system you need a structure you need it operating in that way but for these kind of leaner team decisions and I think I'm sure over time I'll change this and this is to get us you know to 50 or 100 a year and then from there I'm sure I will hire in somebody to kind of like fill in behind this I'll have the conversations and stuff and they will actually operate the boards and I'm sure they'll clean this up they'll make dependencies they'll do all these things but for us right now and probably for a lot of people who would be listening to This this is clean and simple enough to get you great profit and great scale and get projects done because the projects getting done are what get you the profit and the scale. Okay, so public visibility one owner and outcomes over effort, not just making this busy. So this helps you avoid the no deadline BS which we already are having in the system that was prior to this where it's like oh just bump it to the next week, bump it to the next week, no conflict, no priority, that's another one on here. So we are going to use for priorities we're going to do it by due date. So you there are priority fields you can rank them this is the highest is the lowest is whatever for us we're going to do it by due date and then there's calendar views there gant views where things are in order in that way things will get bumped something that'll be due what's today Wednesday things will be due tomorrow we'll go to do them and we'll have something that's like an absolute fire that needs to be done immediately I already have one example and it's not even like a fire but it needs to be done sooner than the other projects so the other ones will get moved to Friday and that one will get moved to there to to tomorrow so it's like we're going to use this in order of doing that and you'll always know. And then there's a date created field actually over here. So you can see when these were created and when they were completed so you have a time from creation to completion. Um but the prioritization has been a huge issue and it no longer will be ideally too many tools. People string together all these tools. They use a spreadsheet for this. They use notion for this. They use ClickUp for this. They use their own datab whatever for this. We're simplifying. Okay. Okay, so the main two tools we are using, like I said here, we're going to have ClickUp and then when we have larger things, we create a dedicated Slack channel that is project based until completion and then we close it. Okay, and that is a big one. We've tried to do just like drop it in a thread and just get it done. That's okay for like mini projects, but when it's fully fledged project, it's not okay. Does not work. It you'll have 150 messages in a thread. Someone will send outside of there, then you'll be in two channel. It just gets soing messy. It's like stupid. So we are going to do a dedicated slack channel. An example of this is like comp overhaul. It's like we want to do a comp overhaul for whatever CS call it. Let's just say an example. We are going to put a dedicated channel around that. We need all the data sent into there. We're going back and forth. It's a bigger project because it affects this and this. While we're talking about that or that's a bad example. It's an entire comp overhaul, not just one department. So it's like I want all the data. I want all the numbers. I want where everyone sits. I want the feedback request forms. I want all that data inside of there. And we're communicating back and forth, back and forth. We're hopping on a meeting that we're setting to go over the data and make decisions. We're going a roll out. We're having the rollout conversation in there. Like it's a fullyfledged thing that needs communication as well as the project and it'll have the subtasks within it to complete them. Overanalyzing happens way too much. That was just what I was talking about here where it's like it's kind of the same as project bloat. You get to a point where you just have so many things that are like dependent on this and this and it's like once you do this then you can do this and then you can do this and then it's like it just it breaks and then you set up automations that create things that are recurring because they're oneoff here but then they're recurring here and it's like it's just too much. So we are going in this method and model. I hope this is helpful to you. You can do this in a sheet if you're super lean and mean but like ClickUp is easy. Asana I've heard actually great great things about but we're here now. I love Dair Table. All of them do the same thing. Doesn't matter what tool you use. all of them do the same thing. I can't show you ours just I mean I basically just did I just created test items to show you ours. Um but yeah, so I hope this was helpful and I hope this is this is just again all these videos I'm this is what I did today. This is a large portion of what I did this entire morning was building this out and then actually migrating everything over from like one-off lists and all this because it was everywhere and now it's all in one place. So I figured again as usual I will talk about what we're doing now to scale. Okay. And this is going to be a very key point because marketing is having things, fulfillment is having things with multiple offers. Sales has new complete leadership and they have like, oh, I want to change this and these slide decks and these scripts and these whatever. It's like we need a list. We need to prioritize. We need to work through them and we need a cadence of meeting and going through these. So, that's where we're at. We're doing okay in terms of cash. Uh, we did what 80 something. We're we're in the right direction. Let's just say that. So, I'll do another monthly update. We'll say the 14th. I'll do another monthly update, but we're going to beat last month for sure. Um, but there's going to be a growth curve. I think I said that in yesterday's video, but there's going to be a growth curve to get this back on to where it needs to be. Um, we came up with some stuff around marketing and we're doing like a complete groundup launch on some cool new things. I can do a dedicated video around that and our theory behind it. Uh, we found some new stuff in VSSLs. We found we shot some new brand face stuff. So, we have like complete diversification there with multiple there. Uh, brand face, multiple page dog is yawning. Um, but yeah, so all the videos will be here. www.ryanclog.comdoc. On the top of this, there's also a request form. Once a week, I go through and answer all your guys' questions live on here. I think I've done two or three of those so far. Um, so feel free to ask questions inside the request form, which is just this, I believe. Just request and you guys can ask questions there. And yeah, that's what I got. All these sorted by tech, marketing, sales, ops, all the things. Follow me on IG and talk there is probably the best one. and then X2. It's just a little harder to keep up on communication in there, I found. Uh, I appreciate you guys. I think today's 63 in a row. So, cooking along and I'm excited to have these videos. I don't know when I'm going to stop, but uh I'm excited to have these videos where this is over 100 on total and then where my trailing is 100 as well. So, we're going to get there and we're going to do live. So talk soon you guys.
