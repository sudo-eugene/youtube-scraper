# financing, pay plans, PIFs... (info/coaching cashflow) | E55

In today's video, I'm going to be talking about financing, payment plans, and cash collection. It is all the craze right now to use financing. So, I'm going to walk you through some simple math models to show you how much money you actually keep when customer use different payment methods and when the cash is actually collected, which is a big big difference across these. All right, so we're going to go through those examples. We're going to go through the different financing options and some of the things the customer sees. And then some of these notes are super super important on how you do things like term alignment and different tools you can use. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million in that business in total. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on this channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. All right, so let's dive in. Now, I'm going to mainly just live in the spreadsheet, but I just want to use this as a guide to walk you guys through. So the different main types in almost all of these and and I can basically touch on info uh versus coaching but for almost all these we're going to use coaching as the example. So first thing is the three different core main types. There are so many different variations of this. This is my napkin math. This is my not opinion but kind of opinion on this and these are the three coursees. So you either have someone who plays a piff and I put discount there because a lot of the times it's framed as a discount whether it actually is or not. So in this example, we're going to say a PIFF is $8,000. Okay? So in your PIF model, you're going to have that you collect $8,000. Now, this is both cash collected and revenue. We're going to use those interchangeably because that is important in this because there's both of them exist. Okay? So when you have cash collected versus revenue is the total contract value of what you sold, which will get be important here. Internal pay plan that is going to be generally speaking where you have terms internally to collect the money. So you're not using any partners, you're not using anything. And in that case, let's use an example because you're generally going to I mean almost always you're going to charge more for this because you have risk of cash collection and you also want to frontload as much cash as you can. So in this example, we're going to say it comes out to $10,000. So instead of selling it for $8,000, instead you're selling it for four payments of $2500, but you are collecting the cash. So you get 2500 right now and then you have it set in your system for three months later you're going to bill another 2500 another. Other people do this where they can frontload it. So it'll be like oh it's $2,500 a month for the first four months and then you get a year access. All of this is a coaching annual example for this but you can make this work for you very very simply just using you know the formulas I'm about to go through. And then external financing. External financing. This one is the big question. So a lot of people will use the exact same price for PIFF. A lot of people will use a little bit higher, right? It kind of all depends on you. And external financing is going to be something like a firm, uh, Split It. WAP has a ton of options. Uh, Clara, those different examples. Uh, a little bit harder in the education info space. That's why is crushing it with this because they have, uh, you can do it direct through them. And then there's a bunch of other like coach specific ones like my coach or whatever it's called. Um, so with these ones, generally speaking, generally, uh, you are going to collect, you're going to charge more because you have a fee. Okay? So, in this example, let's say your PIFF is $8,000. Your fee on this, and I'm going to go through the exact fees, but we're just going through a quick overview. Your fees on this are going to be anywhere from 10 to 15%. I'm going to break those down and how they happen, but so for a 10% example, what you're actually going to cash collect is 7,200. Okay. Now, that is because 8,000 and we're just using a 10% fee of the amount that you're collecting drops down 10%. So, you're actually collecting 7200. Okay. Now, we're going to walk through these different examples now, but I kind of want to talk about this first. So, for the external financing portion, why I say that the fee difference and the spread is there is because if you use something like a firm, for example, they are providing you with a you're getting a credit card number. Okay? So basically how someone's entering in is they're applying for a loan through this and they are then getting approved getting a virtual credit card that they can charge with your system. Okay. When you do that you are then charging them on your processor. So you are making a 2.5 or three or whatever percent CC charge that you pay to Stripe to whatever your processor is, whatever your fees are. So you're losing 2.5 there and then you're also paying a percentage to the financing company. Okay? Okay. So, when you pay the financing company, that's going to vary anywhere from 7 or 8% to 12 to 15%. Rough numbers, we're going to say 7.5, 2.5 to a credit card processor. Both those numbers hit, you lose 10%. Okay. Now, other options of this places like split it. Split it is going to be through W because they have such high volume transa uh volume limits on theirs. It crushes like I know companies who are doing large numbers using this like very large numbers using this. Theirs is different. It is a higher fee structure. It's anywhere from 10 to 15%, but it's a so. So, you are making the money through a on the back. So, you don't have to add the credit card processing. So, basically processes, hits, lands, you know, the classic 3 to five business days. So, that's where that that will hit there. Okay. There are other ones that I'll go through at the end of this just kind of as like notes on here and then these are really important. Um, but let's get into the math. So, I'm going to let this take over. Hopefully, you can see this. See if I can zoom a little. So in option one, we're going to go through the cash collection and when you actually receive it. So like the cash flow of when this occurs. So in model one, and again where I'm getting this, and if you've seen the other videos, uh this is basically the lead acquisition funnel and what it costs to achieve each piece. So if you get a $30 lead, this is using a VSSL opt-in funnel. Just very simple. Cost you 150 bucks to get an app. Cost you $300 to get a booking. 50, you know, 5% of them show on the booking. So, it cost you $545 for a live show and then 20% of the live shows close, which is a $2,700 CPA. You can mess with any of these. You know, I know people who have 40 plus on this, but then your CPA is 1,500. I know people who get $10 leads, and that funnels flow like crazy. All right, so very variable, but we're going to use this as an example. So, in an internal PIF, just like a normal PIFF, someone's going to pay you $8,000. All right? And this is going to be kind of funny, but so they're going to pay you $8,000. Your ad costs on that from here are going to be 2,700ish. Your sales team is going to be anywhere from 13 to 15% of this. And then your fulfillment, if you're doing coaching, there's a lot of variables of this. And I have the different ones where it's if you're the coach versus if you hire coaches versus if you're doing group coaching. This is the example of onetoone coaching where you're paying a coach. Okay, that's going to be the service delivery portion of that is going to be 15 to 20% let's say and people get away with doing better but this is for onetoone service versus group. Group you can get it down to two or five or whatever percent and when it's you it is zero in cash but much more in time. Okay, so in this you're going to be making 36% basically gross profit. So you're going to make $2,800. All right. Now important fact of this month one, month two, month three, right? So on month one, you are you are collecting all of your revenue. You have $8,000 in cash collected and $8,000 build. Okay? So all of that 100% cash collection. Your ad bill is due basically this month. You could technically throw it out to month two, but for this example, we're using it here. You're going to pay your $2,700 ad bill. Your sales team is going to get paid immediately as well. And your fulfillment team is going to, generally speaking, only get paid to start. So, your gross profit that you see in cash on month one is like $3,900, right? But your total that you know it is, if you're tracking your numbers is 2,800, $2,900. So, there is a,000 spread right there or $1,100 spread right there that you will slowly drip across the year that you are paying a coach. Okay? There are people who do this where they just model it and they go, "Hey, hey coach, here's the $1,200 I'm going to pay you for this client for the year." A lot of people do not do that because if you have this person leave, if you want to change stuff or whatever, you just prepaid them and then you'd have to go out of pocket again to pay a second coach. So, it's very realistic in terms of how this actually works. So, this doesn't seem like a big deal. You know when it's a big deal is when you're doing a thousand new clients a month and you are seeing this number and your CPA is fluctuating like crazy and it's going to 3,000 something and all of a sudden your sales team is hitting all these bonus thresholds and they're at 17 or 18 and this number starts to get a little tighter and tighter. Your overhead's climbing and all this is happening and you're not putting in a bucket 30 of these a day, right? So if you're just selling a,000 units, that was my quick math but it's 900. it. So, if you're not putting cash aside to know for the next 11 months after first pay, you still owe another $1,000 in this example, you h you have to pay that into the future. And if you're not bucketing that out, so this one is an example of what happens where you collect all the cash, you look crazy like profitable, but really just have a ton of cash flow that's coming in. And if these numbers are higher, which they can be, like you need to make sure that you have this cash for all of these pieces because the client paid for a year of service. You need to fulfill on said service with a coach that you have to pay for over a year. Okay? Or for the year, right? So that's an example. Now, next one in uh internal payment plan. So in this example, we said instead of an $8,000 PIFF, you're going to self- finance them. You're going to do it internal. So, you're going to charge 10 grand in total. So, you're going to have 10 grand in revenue, but really on cash collection, you're going to have $2,500, which is going to drive that down. Okay. Now, in this model, you're paying $2,700 in ad costs. So, here, let's actually do this. So, first things first, let's make sure I have these aligned so the numbers are equal. So, 15 here, 20 here. Okay. So, same cost structure, right? Oh, yeah, but that that's carrying that. So, no, it's not. Let's do this just so they're the same. Right? So, you're paying $2,700 a year. You're paying a sales rep, which is technically, this is kind of true, but we'll mess with that in a second. And then you're paying $1,600 in fulfillment. Right? So, on paper, you're like, "Oh, I'm making way more money." Way more money. Right? But what's actually happening is you're collecting $2,500 in four payment plans to get to your 10,000. You just paid a $2,700 ad bill. You have a sales team that you're paying. And what really happens depending on how you have this structure, this is actually this is a nugget. You can pay your sales reps however you choose to pay your sales reps, however your comp plan wants to. Now, it is very common to pay a percentage but maybe smaller of a total revenue collect uh of a total revenue amount just like right off the rip, which is crazy to me. There is a method where you pay them every time a payment comes through as that commission amount or there is you pay them this amount or maybe a little bit higher of what you normally pay as a percentage on the only the cash collected in the first 30 days. That is what a sales rep is responsible for if they are selling payment plans of thousand you know 10 pays and just like racking them up over and over and over. There are future numbers like cash collection percentage and things that you don't know about yet. And what I'm about to show you is you are in the hole for months depending. So in this example, you're paying your sales rep on the entire full amount and your fulfillment is that same 1,600 and that still drips out. Okay? So nothing changes there with how you're fulfilling in the coach. But what happens is you only collected 2500 in cash and what actually happened is you subbed fees from your credit card thing and whatever else little small fees that you have to process that payment. So you actually kind of cash collected like 24,400 call or it's probably harder than that. But month one you're down $1,900. Doesn't seem like a huge deal. Understood. But what's actually happening is or I'm sorry, what happens if you're selling a thousand of these a month. This is like the whole cash trough game. If you're only selling pay plans or majority are pay plans, you are like deeply this is per unit. This you're deeply in the red for month one. Month two you still have no new cash and you're paying a coach. So it actually goes deeper. Month three you paid to coach again. You're deeper. And then in month four, so basically you pay for the first three months and then on the beginning of that month is when you pay for the next quarter, you get another 2500 and you are now in the green by $239 because you just collected 2500 but you still paid the coach. You made $2,300 new net in cash that month and the blended across this so far is your $239 up. Okay. Now, as this drips across next month, next month, you're back into the red until you're over here. Okay. get another cash. Now you're back up to your 2,300ish slow drip down again. And that last payment, bump, that's what brings you into the bigger profit number. And all of a sudden, you're here. So on your normal, you collected 24,400 in total. You never even got to 2400 until the final pay. All right? And that's like the big difference here. So the things you don't necessarily know when you're starting or when you're scaling into this is what is your cash collection percentage? And that's kind of what I was talking about over here. So, what is that cash collection percentage? If that cash collection percentage ends up being 75%. You are never receiving this final payment on average. Sometimes it's like this. So, you lost money. Okay? If it's just the last one, you barely squeeze by and actually made less profit by getting more units and having more headaches and more things because you were like, "Oh, I'm just going to get a ton of people in on pay plans." But how it nets out is you actually don't end up making that full 10 grand because of refunds, because of people who just like cancel cards, people ghost you, like just you never collect the future cash. That's why like people use all these financing options and piffs and stuff like that is to get the cash now, pay for the service throughout because they want the cash up front because it's more valuable than some beautiful future number that is like not collected yet. Okay, so that's that model. Can go back and forth on it. We do it. I mean, we have them for sure in-house. uh we have like a pretty strict pro uh process. The other thing actually that's not fair. I didn't give you a full picture. So in this in this example, this would also stop because if you are monitoring this correctly and actually know who's falling off, you stop paying your coach. So the bleed essentially does stop. You don't continue to dig into the red because the second somebody stops paying you for coaching when they agreed to terms of payment, you would stop paying a coach. So, just want to say there it's not like you're bleeding money beyond well, you basically stop service when you stop cash collection. So, make note of that. All right. External financing. So, in this example, this is where I was talking about if you have $8,000 payment uh or an $8,000 PIF that you are charging somebody. Usually, what you would do or what a lot of people do at least is they would actually make this like $9,000 in total. So, you're charging N grand on a PIFF that's external financing. So using like a split it or something like that because they're going to charge you 15 points or 10 to 15 points. So in this example of that you'd actually be cash collecting 8100. You're going to make that on the first pay. It's going to drip down. Nothing is actually crazy on here except the financing and when you actually like receive the cash and then now we're going to go to the customer side of things because that's where the big variance is here for you. If you price this accordingly, the or you like do the math on this, you're actually making more than your PIFF if you increase it above what the fee structure is. Okay? So, let's get into that. So, again, everything's basically the same on this. I can go through and match these for you, but you understand what I'm saying. You're making more cash collected and these numbers would stay the same across all of these depending. Um, I did want to make another note. This sales team thing, a lot of the time you are paying the sales rep on this number. So, like the cash does get a little better in these. And if you have strong cash collection, you're not paying fees. You're actually making more money. Like you have less costs. Like this works, but it's like the long game. And the and if you have bad service, if you have bad product, like if you have bad you have bad issues that happen with coaches, like their pro your customer is not someone who pays their payments. Like this doesn't work. But if you hone this in, you can you can technically make more. It's just like a longer game. Um and all the big dogs use financing a lot of times. So like don't say that needs you need to do pay plans but just as a thing. So quick going through this CC versus AC. So I went through that. So the different ones is going to be a lot of the time like if you use a firm you tech you technically I think can do the other one. Um fee stacking I went through that. So going through how you're going to have credit card processing fee and you're going to have that fee and then a firm split it. So how split it works and I just want to go through the different options of these is essentially split it must be put on a credit card. So when you use a credit card, you have to have the amount in credit limit available on the card. So let's say our program is $9,000. Like if you don't have $9,000 or in this example, yeah, I use 9,000 for the bottom option. If you don't have $9,000 available on your card, you can your customer can't check out. So what they're going to do is they're basically going to charge uh the first payment and they're going to charge the remaining. So that full 9,000. They're going to they're going to check the card for it. So, it's going to sit in that like pending bucket and then the first payment is going to end up posting and then the other one is just like a check to make sure that the credit limit's available and then it'll fall off in three, seven, 14, whatever the day range is. And then we'll throughout the process, throughout the 12-month term, six-month term, whatever they decide to sign for, they are going to check that the amounts are there. And then every 30 days or whatever the pay plan structure is, it's it's every month. So, it's like either every 30 days or every month on the day, it is going to pull that amount and you are they're going to slowly pay it down. So, it's a great option. A lot of people are crushing it with it. It just has a higher fee structure and then you're collecting it via a after multiple days. There's a whole other system and talk about this about like how you handle refunds or how you handle like payment dispute issues once it comes to like having these. The other thing is it is not a loan. Okay, so let's just actually jump down to this because I just want to talk about this real quick. So, a loan versus credit card versus these other options. So, you kind of have three options when it comes to external financing. Um, a customer basically gets a loan, a customer uses one of these options that are like complete like approvals and then you have credit cards and like someone else is so muching better at me than this. So like there's probably nine options but like these are the three I'm using as an example or you can get people approved for a credit card. Okay, so a lot of people do this very very popular in the MMO space because you can get them approved for like some 0% interest card for the first six months. They put 10 G's on it. You're gonna help them learn how to make money and make the 10 G's plus all this other stuff back and pay off the card before they ever have any interest. It's like a it's just like a pay plan, but you get all the cash up front as a company. Okay. So, big difference with Split It is it's all 100% approvals, no APR, and it's just the financing. The fees are just on the back. So, the fees are for you. So, I'm bouncing all over, but So, fixed fee versus variable. Um, a lot of these programs are going to be fixed. I actually have brokered some deals where it is a variable on the back as long as it's fixed on the front. So, somebody like a firm is actually going to have 0% interest free, all these different things that they're going to push towards, but sometimes they will offer offer APR. Sometimes they'll do partial approvals, some of these things. And a lot of people can't even get approved in like the info education, whatever space for a firm at this point because a ton of people did it. Um, but with that it can be a variable in the front end and it it makes it so you can't sell your customer the example of oh it's you know I think at $8400 it's $700 a month. So like it oh it's uh it's $700 a month when the sales rep's talking to them. They go to fill out the affirm thing. They got to fill out the small app or whatever and get approved for it and they go to do it and said it's $812 a month and it's like okay well you told me it was 700. So like that's not cool on the variable side of things, but something like split it and something like an internal pay plan, like those are exact fix. So it's very easy to sell it. You always know what the answer is going to be. You just have a bigger fee structure on the back. Um is one big thing. Term alignment. This is huge. Term alignment if you have pay plans. So let's say that you have a six-month coaching program, okay? And you offer people to pay for it for 12 months. Now it is a lower monthly fee. you're going to get a higher take rate. It's going to take up a majority of your cash collection depending on how your sales reps are and how like a majority of your units. And depending on what you're trying to accomplish, it's not going to convert in the best way towards ascension, towards retention in these different ways because at month six and whatever, you're going to try to push them to either stay and pay again or you're going to try to push them to go into some other community or renew or whatever. and they have six more months of payments they need to make on that credit on that for the first six months because you misalign the terms. I have made this mistake. I did it on accident when we initially signed up for this and set all this up. I just didn't even know that the options were available and they were misaligned and it nuked retention rate because people did not want to then pay you 300 500 whatever a month when they're still paying three or 500 to their affirm their whatever because they signed up for payments that were longer than the term of your service. Okay, a lot of people will do this at size because it doesn't matter and they make all their a lot of their gross profit or like of this of their majority of their customer LTV uh in that first payment and they go okay if we can get them at this higher amount we can do this bigger cash collection then it doesn't matter we can just make the money here that's not how we play and it was a mistake for us to accidentally like like basically allow it without checking it when it happened. Um, customer brand quality. That's a big one. We've had this a lot of mixed bags on this. Some people are like, "No, the people who finance everything are like the worst customers." And we kind of agree with that. Like we definitely, if you look at our complaints or this and that, almost all of them are people who did financing external, not internal. Um, so really guess depends on the market and who the person is and what the offer is. Like it depends on a lot of things. So just like look at your own data for that. Um customer brand quality also in terms of that is like there are a lot of companies out there that are like no like if you can't pay for this right now as is like you're not my customer. Great example tax wealth consultant guy that we met when we were at the event was like yeah I refuse to accept financing because if someone can't pay for it like they're not my ideal client because he helps manage their money. He helps you know do all these things with their taxes. It's like if they're trying to finance it, and there is a case to be made for somebody who wants to pay a small interest or no interest and make payments, you know, and then use that cash for now. But like in this example, he's like, "No, absolutely not." Like someone who's paying my $10,000 fee across 12 payments instead of just upfront is like not my ICP. So like that's very important. Um customer UI, same thing there. It's just important to understand how this looks for a customer and how they go through it because there are different options. Different ones will bring them through like credit approvals. Different ones will like reroute them and ask all this personal information. Uh other ones have none of those questions at all. It's literally their name, their email, and their banking, and it's like you're done. Or just your credit card name, your banking. Um like split it, for example. So, but higher fee structure, but really worth it if you make it work. So, WAP guys have that right now. They just signed that in like a month ago, and it's like apparently crushing for them. I've heard they've done already like uh eight figures through it. So, that's amazing. And then tools to use. WAP was the one example I used. Um, a firm has been great to us when we did use them like more heavily. We have very low financing percentage. That's why that's hot on the mind right now. Uh, because we're rechanging the terms of our deal on the back end, not on the front end. Uh, and talking about changing up some of the offers. So, if we do that, we just want to make sure we have the right fees. So, hopefully we can reroll this out and get 20 40 whatever percent. I still don't know what the hot spot is on what like the dream state of cash of of cash that is financed. um or have like how many pay plans versus not and tools to use. Another fantastic one, Golden Nugget lead, L E A D FI Douglas, he's a G. Um he created a software that basically with name, email, and phone number. You API to them and then it sends back how much if that person is qualified for however much in financing on like the pre-approval style things. uh both on credit cards and I'm pretty sure now on like the the pay now or whatever pay later I don't even know what they're called. Pay now pay later something like that. Um so with those you can then see how how much credit availability they have on current cards. You can see how much they're preapproved for. You can see um like some income ranges on like where they were posted. So it's a ton of data. So, a lot of people use it in the lead processing, but it's very useful if you want it at just the um so like people use it for routing when someone becomes an application for like who the setter should hit or to like DQ people automatically so they don't get your emails if they're under XYZ bucket. Um but another big one is to arm these sales reps with having the access to knowing how much they're available for. And I've heard that go both ways. It's like one if they see some number they don't like, they don't try as hard, but like they still could buy. it's just like you don't necessarily know it or the data is like slightly incorrect. And then I've also heard of people being like, "Oh no, like I I know with conviction that this person has access to 15 or 30 or whatever grand and this is going to change their life and they need to make a move on it." So both ways. But hopefully that was helpful uh the math on these and the sides of these. But yeah, hopefully it was. So uh yeah, message on Instagram, message on X, we're cooking along. Daily update. I add all these to www.rroncl.comdoc so you can see them. Um, we are cruising. We got a sales manager. Today is onboard Pulooa. So, I'm doing this early as can be so that I can do nine hours of meetings after this. So you guys rock and we will talk
