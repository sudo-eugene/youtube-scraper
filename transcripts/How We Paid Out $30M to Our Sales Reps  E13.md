# How We Paid Out $30M to Our Sales Reps | E13
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgN1X18IWY0

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through sales team comp. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected all through a sales team and what this channel is all about is me sharing what we did, what we're doing now and how we are evolving to get to 100 million a year in cash collected. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, uh this has changed over time a ton and in current state we have everyone as W2, right? So to get to future scale, potential exit, just more stability, we wanted to move everyone to W2. Um, so at one point we had up to 30 sales reps, 30 and some change sales reps. Um, and then again to be as transparent as possible, no fluff, no guru Uh, this is currently like the crux of our company. Uh, marketing is doing well. It's it's always a dance, right? It's like quality from marketing, uh, show rates and all of that. That is a marketing and sales piece and then sales team closing. So right now this is a crux for us. But I just want to go into the sales team comp because today I was working on part of the dashboard and I figured this would be helpful. So first things first, uh, let's do this. So for us right now we have a base because everyone's W2. Okay. So this is like 44K, right? So yeah, that times 26 is like 44. Um we do a bi-weekly payroll. So it is just like a two week range for us. It's Sunday to Saturday twice over. Um the it is a draw base. Everyone gets benefits and 401k, right? So everyone is W2 full employee. So no matter what they're getting this 1692. So this does create issues when marketing can only fill 30% calendars or uh poor performance weeks, right? Like it is an increase to what you would be paying if you had 1099 flat commission rates. All right, this is a security thing. This is good for people uh to feel more part of the company and to stay in the role uh even if they do have bad couple weeks or something and you know they can turn it around and just have to get out of a funk. So for us we use three different tiers. These tiers are junior adviser, adviser and senior adviser. Okay, this is defined by their sales per booking percentage over I believe right now it's a 60-day range is is like the most stable number. Uh we've done it over shorter amounts of time like 30-day and beyond. But um and I mean and shorter. Uh but what this is defined as so like sales per booking for us when someone's crushing it is like 15%. Average call it 13 10 is like minimum should be at and then below that is like need some work. And again right now to be 100% candid this is not even where we're at. We're not even at 10% right now and we're having like huge issues with that in terms of marketing and sales connection. So quality show rates as well as closing percentage like this just not meshing. Um so we're working on that actively but in current state uh if someone has a high sales per booking they're in the senior adviser uh basically normal or anything below and still on the team they're on adviser and junior is only used for ramping reps. Okay so junior is going to be you're just like getting their feet wet and getting into the company. Those are reflective of this. they make an 8 n and 10% commission on cash collected net cash collected. So refunds that happen within the first 30 days and I'll go into that in some of this additional portion. Uh also claw back. So anything that happens after that first 30 days is we put it on the company um because we don't feel as if it was the sales rep's fault that someone uh that someone refunded in the clawback. So it's just not on them. Bonus tiers. How we do this is essentially here I'll just break into this right here live. We use a uh a point system for our bonuses. So if you sell a dollar cash collected during the week on a week day you get one point and if it's a weekend you get 1.5 points. So, what this mainly does is incentivize weekend volume because right now I mean W2 technically you could tell them when to work um specific hours and like do it like that where you can have like certain reps that only work on weekend and because we're W2 we can kind of like mandate those times. Not really our culture and our vibe like we always push for it and we incentivize it directly. When we were 1099 this was the initial kick for this because we just wanted them to open it up and there's no as 1099 you're not supposed to tell them specific when they can and can't work. you have the brackets and the 6 a.m. to midnight, but you can't specifically tell them when to work and like what to do exactly. Um, so that was another reason we moved over to W2. I still don't know if that was a good call. Uh, I mean cash-wise, it's a 20% increase in cost. Um, there's like this bottom level of stability that almost makes it so it's like cushier in my opinion. Um, I'm not sure. Since we've done it, we've had a ton of issues in terms of like marketing and like all these other places in the company and that has then also been reflective in sales. So, I can't say like causation correlation on that, but it thus far has not been great and we've just paid more. Especially like if marketing is filling 30% of calendars, everyone is hitting base or just staying at base because they can't get enough units and you're paying out bases versus where you would be paying commission only amount depending on your structure. And then you also wouldn't have the 20% kicker of benefits, employer tax, like all the jazz. So, for this, what'll happen is when you hit 60,000 points, so quick numbers to look at this is like 60,000 in cash collected. You do have reps that are going to optimize for the weekends, which is amazing. That's the whole point. So, they will be getting higher. But just for quick numbers, you can just look at this as cash collected. So, 60K points, $3,000 bonus, 100K 6, 140, 9, and 180 12. Okay. And again, this is over a twoe range. All right. So, we've had people uh on the team that have made three I think someone made over 400,000 definitely in 300,000 as a sales rep for us when like we're fully cooking uh and doing like really well. So over time we you'll have churn, you'll still have those who go to different offers. If marketing stops performing, you can lose those members. So like it can be really tough to maintain and hold them. And that's why we try and do everything around culture. Um so let me just go through some examples of these. And this should be like a pretty quick video. All right. So someone who does 120k cash collected as an example. Now again, we're going to use this as just like simple because the points technically with 120k cash collected, if they did 40k of that over the weekend, that would be equivalent to 60 and they would actually have 140k. And that's where I'm going to show these bonuses. But simple math is someone who's doing 120k is already in top tier because they're clearly one of the top people. So if they're doing 120k cash collected, they'd make a 12k base and they would do uh 6 to9k bonus because they would fall into this bucket if it was all on weekdays. And if it was on weekends, they would have hit this 140K threshold and gotten a 9K bonus. So they would make anywhere from 18 to 21K for the twoe range, which is amazing, right? Because if you crush that across, that's like 40K a month on average. And again, there's dips, there's lols, there's big ones, there's sale weeks, there's like all this kind of stuff that can affect that. But top closers are in this range or have been in this range. In current state, we don't even have this. So 55K cash collected, someone's going to make 4.9K uh 4.95K. I use the 9% on this because this person is probably just in middle tier. They're not top, but they're in this middle tier. They'd make a 4.9K, 9% of 55K. And then depending on if they were in the weekend or not on some of these points, they would hit this 3K bonus. So they'd make anywhere from call it 5 to 8K uh across this twoe range. So again, this person too is if they're just above this, if they're making 60 65k cash collected in a given week, u which is about 10 units, call it for us. Um then right there, they're at 8K every two weeks, 16K. So for that, they're already making 200 grand a year. Okay, on that math, now you have the 10Ks. This is going to be someone who's ramping. This is going to be somebody who is not performing over a given week. And I just want to use this as an example. Someone like this would only be hitting the base because they would be likely in this like 9%. So that's like $900. But for us, draw base is going to no matter what give them base. And I didn't actually fully explain this well enough. So draw base right here, meaning that as soon as they pass this base, the commission just fully takes over. It's not in addition. It's on top of. Okay? Or I'm sorry. Yeah, it's not in addition, it's in replacement of. So as soon as someone gets to $1,700, so they've sold 17,000 at 10%, call it that. Uh it now is the full amount. So now they're at 1,700. Then the next sale they're at uh they're at 2,200 and they climb. But it's not in addition to this. All right. So there's a little bit of security there for the sales rep in that way. A little bit of a burden as the company because if they're under that, you're still paying base no matter what. But it offers a nice incentivized to not go too out of pocket as a company. And then $0 bonus because they didn't hit any of these thresholds. And then in total, it's just that base amount. All right. So that's kind of general gist. Uh in addition to that, oops, in addition to that on here, we will do random contests. So sales manager is awesome. So for us, so we had a little over a million in cash collected before he got there. Had dipped down and then when he took over, we had scaled to like three I think in new at that time and had done like 3.8 cuz we did internal at that time too, like a big internal uh special at the time to do renewals at 5K. But he'll do random contests. He'll do I'm buying someone steak this week tonight. Whoever gets the most uh random week ones. Right now we have a there's an event that's coming up like a conference and uh he set it up so whoever closes x amount of units and like top three get to go to this contest and the company will pay for it. So the company has XYZ burden but it's overtaken by um the contest and the like how much more they perform across that. So just fun random contests. Now these are two fun ones. So net new cash 30-day. So, what I mean by that is I kind of explained up here, but net new or net meaning that if there's a refund that occurs from that first 30 days, it is clawed back. Um, and that's how this entire thing is based. So, it's like super critical for us because you'll have sales reps that'll get people just like over the line and they won't even sign the terms on the next page or like we we try and do it on the call but they'll be like, "Oh, I can't or whatever." Or they sign the terms and then instantly contact support and are like, "I just got bullied. I just did whatever." And like we've had all the I mean we've done I don't even know how many 100,000 sales calls, probably more. I could look, but um just like crazy. So, that's going to happen. You're going to have reps that do that. You're going to have reps that do that for a little bit of time. You're going to have reps that are just like that. Um and for us, it's very important that we claw back on that because we don't need to go more out of pocket than we are. And then this PIFF 30-day, the fun little like secret sauce piece. So, our reps are fantastic at this. I can't even tell you the actual like formalized process because I'm not close enough to um to the sales reps in this way, but we have it set so they get paid on anything that happens in the first 30 days. So if someone uses a payment plan and checks out for $3,600 payment plan. So it's I think that's two pays plus something else or like a $2,100 pay plan. If they up any of that amount to basically PIFF within the first 30 days, we pay the sales rep. So the sales rep will follow up and go back and forth and the coaching obviously like can do it as well or CS but anybody in that sphere will push them will will be like you know are you enjoy the program so far? Do you want to save on future payments? Do you want XYZ? And then we'll get them to pay off their full balance where they can get the $7,200 pricing which is only if you piff in the beginning if they do it up with if in that first 30 days. So, you're going to have someone who then just pays the other $3,600 balance or someone who did $2,100 who then pays a $5,100 balance within the first 31 days or in the first 30 days and the sales reps get commission for that. So, we have a really good actual review of this. Like sometimes I'll be like, "Oh, look at all these new units coming in today." And it's all just our billing manager running them that from submitted. So, that is the general gist of how we do it. Um, in the past, we just had it as percentages. For the longest time, we were 1099 only. So, when we were doing I mean, we had to have done 50 to 60 million probably through this funnel before we actually moved everyone to W2 on the sales rep side of things. Um, just because we want to standardize things more and like legally you should if you're doing all these standardizations and like force meetings and all that. Um, so that is one of the reasons we moved everyone over and for future exit. Um, but I I've heard of a ton of ways to do this. Uh, a lot of the people say that base should be basically half. Uh I hear stuff where a base becomes less than half at scale. Obviously it should. Uh another really good one that I recently heard is unit based. So I don't want to dox who said this, but unit based. So where basically if you're at and you have to know your company and your numbers, but call it uh for the first 10 units, then uh call it 10 to 15 units and then 15 units plus. They will do it unit based across the whatever period. So either a two week or a monthly or something in that range to where if they get 10 units this is like 6%. This is 8%. And or even lower honestly I've heard of it like this. So like this is crazy competitive. So like if you're in this range you it's very hard to make like a large income like multiple hundreds of thousands. So you have to be in this range. Um, and then I've heard even crazier ones, but like basically this idea that you have this lower amount and then you have this like big jump. So everyone is just hardressed to get units. So it's like how can I do better follow-up? How can I do all this? So like I said, I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. In current state, our sales team is not performing in like the best way that it could. And that is a many many multitude issue of show rates of quality for marketing. Um of the actual like team and the vibe um the structure and how we have it all set up. The count of bookings and expectations of how many bookings or hours they work and then marry that with how many show rates and stuff like that. So you could have someone who only accepts 50 bookings a week which could seem high but that's for us 30 minutes. That's 25 hours there. You would have 5 hours of meetings if you do an hour meeting a day. you have all the admin stuff, so maybe five there maybe. Um, and like even then you're at you have 50% of those that show. So like the math gets all kind of wonky around and we're still trying to solve for this. Um, but we have had success in many ways when at 1099 and then we had some while we were at W2 and right now it's kind of like turnaround season and we are roughly in that range of like 10%. Um, because show rates are down because close rates are down. So, we're optimizing for that. And I've made other videos on this, but we're optimizing for it with uh low ticket because we've never done low ticket. So, instead of having a lead book on the call, we're optimizing for it uh instead of a lead booking on a call, we're having buyers book on a call. Um so, you're going to have low ticket buyers instead of leads. We're going to use setters for both funnels. So, for low ticket, it's basically going to be like implementation call to a closer. And then we're also going to do it uh everywhere of like the the main lanes of the VSSL. So, think like people who apply but don't book, 50% of those people drop off. So calling those and we already have stuff like email and AI and all that but like actually dialing these uh no show and cancel huge lift potential. Um, if 40% of your calls, 50% of your calls no show and cancel, instant dialing when they actually submit it or if they reach out and say that, um, try and find a lift there. Cuz if you recapture 10 of those a day on both fronts, so-called 20, and you have a 10 to 15% sales per booking, like you just got two to four units a day, which in our case is 20 grand, 25 grand. Uh, so yeah, it stacks up when you start to get these little percents and spots, but this is what we're currently operating on. Um, so I just want to share where we're at with that and I will 100% update as we go. And again, as always, DM on Instagram is the best place if you want to communicate and comment with any questions or things you want me to talk about because I'm just shooting these raw. So, let me know.
