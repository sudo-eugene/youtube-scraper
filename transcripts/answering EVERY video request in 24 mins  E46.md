# answering EVERY video request in 24 mins | E46
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXcn1BLQYWo

In today's video, I'm going to be doing an ask me anything out of the video request box. I have a form on this page right here where you guys can ask for topic requests to be covered in videos. And I just went through it and there is some gold in here. So, I'm going to go through these everything from effectively building VSSLs with low budgets to scaling from the ground up and what I wish I knew when I started. All right, so figured I would do all of these in one video. So, I'm just going to do it straight off the rip. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done 71 million. It's actually 72 million now in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. I do all these videos just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Today is Saturday the 27th, and I am just going to have fun with this. So, this is going to be a straight rip. So, let's go through it. How do you ensure your leads view your trust assets prior to sales calls to keep them the most warm? and how do you manage your sales team to be on point to handle objections and not have to sit and review calls? All right, so how do I re how do I make sure that they're reviewing these? So first off, you have to make sure you have these and you have to make sure that they're in a consumable and easy to consumable format. So for us, first things first is it's going to go on a thank you page. So the main video, the objection uh pre-objection blocks, uh testimonials, things you want them to consume and review prior to the call are going to be the first thing they land on. So on your redirect inside your booking widget, they are going to land on this page. When a setter sets them, they are going to send them this page in your emails after they book. You're going to push them back to this page. If my video is glitching, I am sorry. It's because you don't subscribe. Now, going back to that, all of that is going to exist on one page and it's going to be like the pre-call homework. You must watch this. Everything is framed as must watch this before. Okay? So, that's the trust asset portion. Um, and then making sure that those are good and easy to use and yeah, just making them just required. So, the objections prior and babysitting. So, for us, the twofold. So one is like having an actual large objection list that is already uh trained on and as well as just like provided to the team so they have it in a playbook in the CRM or somewhere where they can see the most common ones. So for us it's like a husband objection um it's like the classic financial objection it's the you know time is this the right time for me all those things and those already have multiple example responses to them. They cover them in trainings and then we also on the back end almost in a reactive way. So that's the proactive chunk the reactive ch or yeah that's the proactive way. The reactive way is we then do actual live call reviews. So both like solo and then across the team as well. So everyone can um get value from the one. So it's like a one to many approach for sales call reviews. And then also we have a software that we use, Zoom revenue accelerator, that will go through how to uh or it'll basically scorecard them and you can ask in there like based on this objection or did they um set the tone, did they take authority in the call, did they do this and it'll answer through AI and give you a scorecard that is then summoned across the whole team where you can review them and kind of like quick scorecard without having to watch an 30 to an hour long zoom. Managing sales team process to make closes just objection, no friend breakdown happening. exact same thing I just said. So, we have a scorecard on this. A lot of people in the past have had VAS that do this. There's now AI that does this. So, there is Gong. Um, there is Zoom Revenue Accelerator. You can build it custom. Um, there's a lot of out- of- thebox tools. Someone just sent me one the other day that's like cheapo, but I believe the number for Zoom revenue accelerator is like 40 or 50 bucks a month per license, which is like not bad. So, for us, we have, you know, 25 30 of them and it's like a thousand bucks a month. So, how do you effectively build a converting VSSL, a high converting VSSL with a low budget? So, I built the first one um or wrote the first one and structured the first one from a $5,000 course I had that I'm pretty sure is now for free. So, um Becker used to Alex Becker, who's like super prominent now in crypto and also um owns the Hyros ad platform. So, he used to have a course. I paid like five grand for it. It basically was a troden horse to get you into the software which worked and we love Hyros and we still use it to this day especially for like the viewer. Um, but for the actual converting VSSL, he had one in there that was like a 15-minute script, and then he had one in there that was a 25minute script that was basically, you know, set intention. Here's what you're going to get. If you stay to the end, get this bonus. Here are the four keys in order to do so. And then wrap up in CTA very simply. Um, and then how you actually structured like the design, the video of it, PowerPoint style, keynote, whatever. And it had the different ones almost ESPN style. That was the original one we built. Since then, we have copied people. Since then, we have bought other courses. Peter Kell is a really uh big guy that has frameworks that are public. He's like the VSSL god. Um Nick Verge is on there. He has really really good VSSLs and uh writes them. As well as so you can either buy courses that have them, you can find it free on YouTube of people who have done it that convert. You can funnel hack people that have them live because generally speaking, they're either testing or working and the ones you can see that have a ton of uh spend behind them are still working or they would not be spending money on them. Um, and then the other is either paying someone like a lot of time it's like 20 grand right now, 15 20 grand or you can find somebody that you pay that is doing it as a percentage basis. So the sales that come through there, they'll take 30% or 10% or whatever and you can always broker a deal. Um, so there are plenty of people out there that'll breaker uh broker that deal with you and be willing to do that. So hope that answers that one. But could you do a breakdown of how you structure payouts for your team, how you invoice clients? So these are two different things. So one is how I pay the team or how we pay the team, sorry. And then the other is how we invoice clients. So before I say any of this again, like these are all my this is my experience. This is my opinion on these things. Um I kind of feel like weird egoy douchy when I say some of this kind of stuff because it's like this this is the way and it's not always the way it's a way. There's 25 ways to get to the same results and this is just my experience with it. So I hope that is clear. So how we structure payouts for the team. So the actual software, this is actually just kind of like a side tangent, but we used to use Gusto. Um used to work really well. And then now there's like deal and rippling. They always go back and forth and they have some tea if you want to look at them. They're always beefing back and forth. But we use Ripling for that. Um 95% of our team if you come team is just like people that do work for us and uh work with us. Uh is W2 now. Um the other part is 1099 but for a long time everyone was 1099. So how we structure payouts for the team is driven by KPIs. I have an entire video on the channel of like who is paid as a performance versus a flat. My goal is to get everyone as close to performance as possible. Whether that is the company's profit share total or if it is just the deliverable within their department. A good example of this is across like our seale or leadership style um team. We have a CMO, we have a chief product, we have uh sales and we have whatever. Let's just use those three as an example. All of them make some version of a base. They then make some portion of a performance directly or majority performance that is based on their role and their KPI. But they also then all interact with each other. For example, the CMO is going to make it based on net CPA, right? So they can control a ton of that in terms of marketing costs, but because we're mainly a call funnel and it's done over the phone, that then touches sales. So the CPA could be 5K, but if they close really well, it could be 1K. So they have, you know, um they have they're in the fight the same where they're trying to help sales with quality with whatever because the higher the close rate, the lower the CPA. Now sales, same thing. They're constantly looking for bookings at whatever uh volume of bookings. So they are trying to support in that with marketing and uh help there. Product that one is tied to profit share which is directly in line with the um the cost per new client acquisition which is essentially that whole bucket. So like acquisition is marketing and sales and then fulfillment is that product and people side. They get paid as a profit share. So they need to make sure that the costs are here, the closing rates here and they have the right people and the right quality. Okay. So how do we invoice clients? This is direct billable. So we use order forms. Right now we still use Clickfunnels. We use Stripe for processing. We do have backups because everyone says we're stupid if we're just on there. But we still have just maintained that because we have good customer support and we are good to our product and have a good brand and we refund people and have a low chargeback rate if they're not happy or if we don't feel like they're a good fit for the program and they were missold or anything. So that's how we pay. I think that's what you're asking here, how we invoice and then send receipts and all that kind of stuff. Um they check out, they fill out their card information, they side in terms on the client side. So that it's all you know kosher in that way. How do you acquire info client deals? Touch point to onboarding signing deal for your bid. Hard on cold email but heavy hitting starting from zero. Um all right. So I assume what you mean by this is like how to build an info coaching business where you are not the face. So basically like you run the business, you operate it and there's an expert. So that is the style that we did. Now to be clear, I was not the one who started this one, right? So the other co-founder, two co-founders and me owners, right? Um, so one co-founder was the expert. The other co-founder was the person that approached this deal. Basically came to them came to the expert and said, "Hey, I want to build a business around you. Um, we're going to sell this. We're going to scale this. You're going to get X percent." Generally speaking, it is a minority percentage because they are acting as the face, the whatever, but all of the fuel in terms of the acquisition, the fulfillment, the building of the team, the like entire company is done by said operator or business builder versus the expert. Okay? So, how you go about that is if you have no case studies, results in anything in terms of like paid or funnels or anything. Um, generally speaking, it's a trust game. So, you're going to compile case studies that are not yours and you're going to say that. I mean, that's how I work at least. I know people who kind of like fake it till they're make it. Not my speed, but I would go through and basically find case studies. Um, us as an example, there's like a million of these, but I know some guy messaged me the other day and he did it with, you know, here's my face or my expert and it's in a yoga niche. teaches people how to start businesses in the yoga space. Um, and he came to him, built a business around him. I don't know their exacts. He was just in DMs and was nice. So, but like there's a million examples is what I'm saying. So, generally speaking, call it 7030, call it 8020. Some people go 5149 depending on how much like leverage and um how you can sell the deal. But you're going to approach them, say, "This is a thing." You're going to productize their service. You're going to build a business around them and they're going to get paid to do it. But you need to make sure you have a good relationship with them. You need to make sure ideally that this is like structured and written out well. Um cards are going to be a lot. You're going to hold hold a lot of the cards in terms of making sure things actually work and handling payouts, handling all the books, handling the team, all of that. The big thing though is like I've heard this way too many times where you get somebody up to half a million dollars a month that they're making or something crazy, right? And they just are good. They're just done. They're like, "Oh, I already gave you the ads. I already gave you the product. It's auto fulfill. whatever and then they go find a beach somewhere and your business like goes to zero. Like you need continuous ads, you need continuous uh support and that has been a blessing that we've had the co-founder expert um in our business has been like the hardest worker throughout the entire building of the business in the beginning in order to get us there. The iteration on ads, the iteration on product, just like the time like in it in it in terms of like a real business partner, not just like some influencer that's a face. So like it was just not the model we had. That's extremely important because I have heard so many times that the expert dips after they make a little bit of cash. So, making sure you're good there andor that you can diversify, you own the IP across it. Very important. You own the assets and that's clean and clear. So, signing the deal, do that. Hopefully, that was helpful. Again, ask more questions in this inbox at any time. And I'm going to do these just because none of these are like one whole video. I feel like I could do some of them a bit longer, but I just feel like this would be a good way to do it. how I helped warrior babe scale to 1 million mistakes that you can avoid. Um, so again I came in, we're definitely under a million, but I came in and the initial was helping like in-person personal training clients. Then it moved into building like an info product oven style uh where it was like a course and it was $500 like direct to cart. Then it went to a low ticket app uh was like a $27 a month 7-day free trial with $147 a uh Otto to have lifetime access. So, like he was attempting to do the lowfunnel AOV game and ascension rates and MR like LTV didn't work. Okay, there's a lot of words in one, but they all made sense in it if you replay it. Um, so how I scaled it, I didn't directly scale it. Um, I came in and they already had product market fit, which is I see another question down here. I'm ripping these off the top, so sorry if I'm yapping, but um, we basically had a call. We were doing 30 grand, 50 grand, something a month around there and like breaking even basically after everything between ad and fulfillment and stuff. And we're like, how do we take this thing to 10 million and I was like, I would love if we did a call funnel. Like, let's do a call funnel. Let's build the product. We already have it in the background. You guys already built it. You just didn't sell it directly or via the phone. So, we're like, let's do that. And that's how we got to the first million month was selling info. That same course exactly as it was before we even we revamped it after that, but around it was before then. That's how we got to a million a month was selling that course over the phone increasing the price from 497 to97 to 14.97 building the sales team having fulfillment basically like very small scale because we just needed more people to manage community and do group coaching calls but the product already existed fulfillment cost just got smaller as a percentage um as we scaled up the front end but it was a mass volume mistakes I can avoid um in that we should have this kind of just like a broad overall we should have varied the we should have focused more on the acquisition as we began to scale and began to change things because it was rising and we didn't know our numbers well enough and I was not involved enough on like the true true numbers not just marketing numbers at the time to understand kind of where the cash flow was going when we moved over to coaching which had inherently a higher cost to fulfill because we have a onetoone coach so there as that acquisition grew we should have hired the right people and hired a CMO at an earlier phase because we were doing the marketing the other co-founder was leading it and you know in it out of it in ways of like we tried agencies so we could be out of it. We tried having good internal people but not really managing them that well. And then also overarching in marketing we did not optimize for the acquisition model. We just kept running the same one. And that was a lot of me probably being like we can push it further. We can push it further. But I also wanted to launch a low ticket that we just I didn't press hard enough. I didn't build it. I didn't know how. I didn't hire the right people to do it. And we should have. So, we should have changed acquisition models to have low ticket earlier when we had all this massive free cash from what we were doing and we didn't. Um, and then yeah, I think we just scaled kind of too heavy. We did this W2 shift too early like legally it we had two different lawyers look at it on like if we should be W2 or 1099. They were both like me kind of thing like into the future and like if you want to like exit and all stuff like they should be W2 but like in current state do they need to be? No, but kind of. And we're like, "Oh, future state, future state." And we were doing these big numbers. Literally, as soon as we did that, also the acquisition stuff broke, also this. So, it just ate up what would be profits at the time and cash got tight. So, yeah, I mean, run it leaner, not higher into future state, but more so higher where it hurts. And then making sure that you always know your acquisition numbers, especially especially if your entire business is acquisition, paid acquisition led. So, yeah, I could go down this one forever. Uh, we should have leaned into organic better. We still to this day don't touch organic. We should have done setters earlier, lean version. Um we should have had more direct to cart stuff that had lower fulfillment, more ascension to build a moat. Like there's just a lot of things there. But uh technical side of paid ads attribution and making it dumb down. So the dumb down version is just get high. So Hyros does it. It's really good for call funnels because the buyer journey is longer and being able to have all the finger point fingerprint and touch points of where they were and watch the journey whether they clicked on an organic thing, they did a Google search, they saw an ad here, then they saw a retarget ad here, then they saw a Google ad. So meta meta Google and then they purchased and knowing that buyer journey. Hyros can do all of that. Then it can also fire to the pixel. Um, it's the simplest way to say it. Like, I mean, it's probably not the simplest way to say it, but the simplest way is you just throw the pixel on site, you connect Hyrosse to all of your sources. So, you have bookings, you have calls, you have Stripe, you have all those things, and it just collects all the data and then pushes that back to where the conversion came from. There is like way technical more ways and you know people say Hyros picks up 80% of it and you know, if you want the deep deep detail, you got to do it custom or with these back-end solutions and all this. The 8020 is if you just want to just get the like the best result for kind of like the least amount of effort. You just pay for high roast. It's overpriced supposedly. I don't know. I think it works and we definitely make more money from it than from what it costs. So that's what we use as one portion. And then we also do a full custom side. The nitty-gritty is you want your browser and server events to match and you want to make sure they're going back to the right sources from the right things. So, if an event happened like an application, a booking, uh, or a purchase from Facebook, you want Facebook to know that. You want to make sure that they see that the person did it on site, which is the browser, and then you're also sending them the data from your side of things, which is the server, roughly speaking. That's kind of how that works. And you want them to match so that Facebook sees that we have that data, they have that data, good to go. So, that's the gist. And then using standard events supposedly is the new thing that everyone uses native or like standard events. We use those, but we had really, really good results and did large numbers when we're using custom conversions. And I just talked to someone the other day that does complete custom conversions for people who have issues with the meta health change that occurred on the pixel. They just set up custom conversions prior to this and like sees the pixel and it works as good or better than it did prior and they have no purchase even optimization they can make. So, I don't know. But there's smarter people than me out there who do this. But that's the 8020. Um, what do I do if a sales rep is out and full calendar of book calls? This happens more time than I would like to admit. Um, a lot of times someone's power will go out. They are don't have internet for whatever reason. They're traveling and they thought they were going to have service and they don't. So, they will notify us in the Slack and we will take a basically like screenshot more or less of here are the calls and here are the contacts of when they have them and who can pick them up and people will either have open spots, they will have no shows, they will have something. They will claim those calls and take them. They notify the person, they or they hop on the autogenerated Zoom link and they take the call for them. We remove it from the person so it doesn't count against their bookings, but it's like obvious obviously a no no, but then that person who just claims the booking gets the opportunity to have it and gets the opportunity to get the close. So I think that's what you mean by that. How to scale from the ground up and find product market fit. Not the right guy to be answering that question. I have never directly done this and it is just not in my skill set. I've never taken something truly zero to one. I like courses. I like frameworks. I like systems that work. I like finding somebody who use an industry to do 10 million a month and going, "Okay, cool. Well, I at least can get this to 10 million a month if I just follow their framework, roughly speaking." And it's again, it's like, you can look at it two ways. It's one, it's like shoot for the stars and if you land at 5 million, like good for you because you tried to execute it how they did and you followed their framework and you got there. Um the other is once you get to that, it's like a new frontier. I talked to that ad um Adam from Ringba last week and he was like, "Cool, yeah, you know people who do 10 million, but how do you get to 50?" And it's like there's a lot of different ways to look at it on that. Um, but for the 0ero to one, nothing is new. Everything is a variation of something that exists. I try and like put my mind in that frame a lot. And just a small iteration of something can be seen as 0ero to one. They started this business specific from the ground up. Everything else I've done has been generation or scaling again of something that exists. All these like affiliate lead genen style stuff. You're not really creating something from new. You're scaling something that's already an offer and exists. um random drop ship stuff like anything I've ever done has been that. But in my best attempt to answer this to how to scale from the ground up would be and really with this part finding product market fit. I'm a big believer in being able to talk to the customer and get feedback from them. So assume coming up with basically the theory that X niche of people have X problem which you can do so much research now on with Chad GPT and Reddit and like all these things. This is a problem that people are continuously having. You come up with a service that solves it. You frame I help these people do this within however you do that. Get them to watch a video that's basically going through that or a sales copy about it and then either sell them something low ticket or have them book a phone call which I think is even easier. Um where you are going to offer to help them with it. Get them on the phone and talk to the actual person to be able to get feedback on what the problem is, what really is the problem within that. Go deeper. Do a bunch of discovery and then you can adjust your messaging and offer in alignment with that. I also think that you should do that before you build an entire course on how to fix something or build an entire product on how to do something when you've never sold one of them because you may be completely wrong on what you're building and you just wasted a 100 hours building or buying or spending money or whatever to build a product and service that people do not want even though you think they want it. So starting from the front and selling it first. Managing online teams. I made a whole video on this. We're completely remoteund and something people uh Slack is like where all the communication is. channels are split up by division. So like by team slash like results. So like you'll have a sales team, you'll have a setter team, you'll have a coaching team, you'll have an operations team, and then you'll also have like offshoots like a webdev external for contractor. You'll have a marketing team specific, you'll have a paid ad specific. If you have breakouts and there's enough people, it makes sense to split things like a marketing main and then creative paid, creative organic. Those are generation and like editing for both of those. a copywriting. When you're doing a lot of copywriting in terms of email scripting, stuff like that, it makes sense to break things out, but don't go over. So, that and then a meeting cadence. We run on the same style of agendas and like project lists, to-do lists, in Q lists. Uh they are all structured the same way. So, it's uniform across. It is a top- down approach. And then we do those on a weekly cadence with some pop-up just random meetings when things need to be worked through. uh and most of the meetings are around making decisions and coming up with the projects and then the actual projects are taken offline into their own meetings to be handled versus trying to like work through an entire project when you have five or six of highly paid people in there. Um so yeah, so that's those and then dashboards and KPIs are huge. So everyone is on the same page and transparently sees the same numbers whether that's a P&L or performance specific KPIs to their department. Those are in there. A video on how you organize your team via Oh, whoops. uh project manager, Slack or whatever. I did make a video on this as well. It's like the how we manage 110 people team. Um but for one to two VAS are looking to grow. So for one to two VAS, again, I would set it up by by like topic. So for example, if I had like a lead gen one, which I've had like as a, you know, side fun thing, but like I would have a creative, I would have a media buying, I would have a copy, like I would have the different segments of what's important to that. So you have someone who's doing the actual clicking of the buttons for media buying. You have someone who's doing the creative and then likely they're working with someone who's doing like copyrightiting scripting both for the ads and for the video scripts, let's just say. And then you'd have like owners operations or whatever. Let's just those are the exact ones. If you were doing lead genen scale, you'd also have one that was buyers. You would have one that's right. It's like what are the segments of the business and who lives within them and then where is their overlap that would exist in a general or like an operational level and then put those people in the right buckets so they're focused on what they're doing but they can collaborate with the people that are important. Um, and then a project manager generally is going to overlook that whole process, especially at a small scale like this if you even need a project manager. But if you don't think in that left brain style, uh it's probably helpful andor using some sort of AI or ClickUp or ASA or something like that so everyone's on the same page with projects where they are coming up with a decision-m either you or as a crew deciding on it and then watching the status of it as it goes through the pipeline or funnel of to-do in progress needs review live and iterating on that feedback. So hope that was helpful 23 minutes in. But yeah, none of these are like I mean I guess I could package some of these into like full videos if you guys want, but feel free to pop here. www. need to do the WWS cuz I broke something. I don't care to fix it. Uh in the request, um you can ask more questions and then just drop in a quick little thing. Daily update, same thing with doc. I have all the videos. We are on day 46 today and I've done one of these every single day. Um I put them all in here, segmented them by what category, date, the actual kind of idea because the title is changing. Uh there's a kid who's like editing all the thumbnails and doing this and I have to pull him back sometimes because he goes a little too clickbaity. But that's that. Um quick daily update. Yesterday we did 63 grand, something like that. Uh we're hiring a sales manager. We need consistency around this. Same count of bookings, not the same amount of sales. Did a video yesterday on low ticket. It is like crushing it in terms of acquisition. We just need to get to volume and for that we are waiting on the CPA to be in alignment and then making sure that the setter team is on the back end. But the current chokeold is sales. So, I am hiring, hiring, hiring. It's Sunday and I have meetings at 7 PM tonight to talk about it further with some of the candidates and I have another hundred that I'm combing through and trying to pull out the best ones. So, hope that was helpful. Feel free to ask questions. Um, and yeah, hit me up on XIG, wherever. All right, talk soon you guys.
