What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through the org chart that we used to do $30 million last year in 2025 cash collected. Um, and then I'm just going to go through kind of where it was, where we're at now, uh, and what our plan is. And again, this channel is basically just what we've done, what has worked, what hasn't worked, and just try to figure all that out and document it so I can look back in a few years and laugh or just see kind of what has changed. So, all right, starting with marketing over here. So, this is our new setup. So, to be blunt, this is not what we have been operating on. So the plan here for where we're going is way more direct response heavy. So being direct response heavy, we need more page builders. We need more copy. Uh we need more graphics than we have in the past. So we actually up until now have not even had a CMO. Um so the other one of the founders, one of the other owners is very very strong in marketing and sales. Um and he has been basically acting as CMO as well as CEO. I didn't put kind of that on here. Owners and CMO or uh CEO, but he's been acting as this this entire time and was doing all the media buying up until like 20K day uh and beyond. So very very involved in this because it's his it's his like superpower, his strength. So if you watch a lot of Hormosi stuff like at a certain point you are the best up until XYZ, but like he could get really really far um because he's so talented at it. So big benefit there that we had. Um but up until so the new structure is going to be graphic designer, Google media buyer, media uh meta media buyer and then they technically have like a secondary person that's in there running with them. Um copywriter which is everything email as well as um so like scripting emails and then um just basically like on page stuff that we need depending and then creative director. This overlooks for us currently all organic and paid uh creative. So, manages all of the actual um creative itself, not the distribution necessarily, but um all that portion and then has an editor that does all of the creative both for ads as well as organic videos. Um a little less in the organic for us currently, but and then page builder is someone who can build inside ClickFunnels, web flow, all those things, whatever your tech stack is to make things that are consistent, brand oriented across. So, this is where we're at right now. This is everyone we have more or less on the team now that we're looking to take this to nine figures a year or more. Um, and there will be more. There'll likely be a project manager in here. There'll likely be some other pieces as we have more offers, but in current state up until now, we've only had one main offer. So, what we have had, uh, I'm just going to delete out of this as we go. So, we had Google buyer, we had media buyer, we had a copywriter, uh, creative director and editor. These are kind of newer. And then page builder didn't exist. So, I built all the pages. That's why they're so ugly. Um, so I would just funnel hack people. I'm not a designer. Um, so I built all the pages. Luke more or less built um the other founder build the um all of the copy and offers and stuff like that and we kind of go back and forth on that. I build all the pages, I build all the tracking, uh all the setups there, all the splits, any dashboarding, any of that kind of stuff. Um and then we'd run them and then either he was running media or uh these guys were running media on it. So that's the general setup. Um tech side of things. So I'm like technically CTO. So I do CTO and then more or less like strict I don't even know you want to call it like executive ops. So basically uh managing this the operations level team um in one meeting and just making sure that all departments are across here all the numbers across the entire company uh all the KPIs, dashboards, all that kind of stuff as well as like project lists. Um we have really strong leads in this way. So there's not really like micromanaging level at all that happens where sales runs sales, product and people runs people, marketing runs marketing. Um, and I'm just kind of like interwoven in a bunch of these. Um, but I have a senior tech lead. I've talked about this in other videos who is like a killer in terms of automations and stuff like that. Not so much custom code getting in that direction. Um, and I can have other videos where we go into like continue education stuff. We got him in uh like a development developer program. Uh, learned a bunch of stuff around like actual more custom coding than just plugging things together with automations. Um, but he builds all of our AI and custom tech and stuff like that. Um, and then tech support. is a huge one. This is been since like employee number 10 maybe. Um so I did it for a really long time, but it's 11 p.m. and someone can't get in their email and you're resetting passwords and you know you're out and stuff like that. So we got a tech sport that's a VA um technically a team of VAS but act as one inside our Slack channel and they do all things for setups, onboards, uh anything that's like techreated in that way and then any SOP related stuff. So um creative director or I guess copywriter creates a new script gets it to creative director goes to brand face other founder who's a rockstar um and she records it comes back to creative director editor uh edits it long form organic video for example podcast episode um then she will then post it then it'll go over in SOP then goes to tech support she'll put it on the website she'll put it in all the places do all the right tagging then it goes back to copywriter and then it gets sent out via email, all that kind of stuff, right? So, um yeah, so that's kind of the tech department right now. And then I still act as like all of the tracking and all the setups on all the new builds. So, I am working currently to get out of that, but because we've only had one offer, it's not really like a continuous thing. Um for me personally, like I my strength is more so in I do the buildouts, anything like that, but anything that's recurring, it's like the most painful thing in the world to me. So uh we're currently working to see amongst his current team as well as we have an external service provider that uh we're looking that will do buildouts and then basically provide SOPs to team. So they would come in and say uh you know here's the new sixstep ClickFunnel setup. They'll build all the tracking and they'll build all the data that pulls from all the right steps and then log them in and what date uh what type of data fields or custom fields inside the CRM what triggers what what does all that and then we would manage it thereafter. Right? Right. So instead of me doing all that portion, they can do that heavy lifting and then uh just for like the onetime setups and then building everything dynamic. So when we do splits, when we do all that, the reporting just stays and you can see uh across. So sales, so this is the like new setup. So for us, this is acting as the same person right now. Um because we hired a sales director in and then we've tried setters in the past and it never worked for us. We didn't maybe didn't have the right person, didn't have the right setup, just something just didn't work for us when we tried to do it last time. Um, so what we have operated as, so again, so this is where we're going. So we just, this starts is March of 2025. We just brought in a setter manager. It starts this week. They're bringing in setters. So this is going to be a new function. Um, but thus far, we have had none. Um, and then this is really what acts right now. So we have a closer manager, which is really our sales director. Um, but because we scaled down because kind of where we're at, we're just looking at this is like this person is wearing both hats uh in Kurate. And then all the closers, we got up to 30 or so closers at one point. So the closers actually broke out and there was I could add to this, but there was there was pods. So basically we had 15 and 15 in each one. So you had like one of the sales uh reps that then was also a pod leader. So they could have their own dedicated meetings. So you don't have 30 people on one meeting trying to do management and like uh oneonone connection and stuff like that. Uh and then a sales uh operations manager, sales coordinator, which is basically um in here doing all the details and kind of like holding people accountable, making sure the stats are on um just providing like a ton of support to the sales team different than the director who's doing the oneto ones, who's doing the cadence, uh who's leading the meeting, stuff like that. So again, this is what we had. I can delete this cuz I made this for this video and took out everyone's names. Uh so this is what basically we have been operating as. I mean, and again, it's really been this for 30 million a year was this. Uh, not to say that's the best way to do it. And again, this is just like how we did it. Um, but yeah, this this is how we did up to, you know, 3.8, I believe, last year was our our peak month. And then since we've scaled down, I can do other videos on how like the evolution of this, but we basically had like three big upticks as we just like ramp into it. Um, the last one was the 10 million to 30 and then right now we're like scaled down again. um just restructuring getting in there because if costs go out of whack, you're just making a bunch of topline or cash collected to not keep it if things are like out of whack. So if your cost per acquisition goes up double or something across that range or you set up comp plans wrong or there's too much waste or something, then you know you're doing the same profit dollars on a higher revenue number. It's just like vanity. Um which, you know, we're not here for anymore. And at maybe at a certain point we were, but the goal is not that anymore. It's true bottom, true profit dollar. So, um, all right. And this is kind of like, uh, this is on fulfillment, so not so much really what this channel has been about or what it's really going to be about. Um, because this is like company specific, uh, especially like phone coaching. Like we're in fitness, for example. So, this is going to look a little different on actual fulfillment, especially on like tech and those videos. But, um, just overall, so CBO, this is uh, chief of people and kind of chief of product. Um, but the title is chief of people. um absolute rockstar in our company. So this is like literally the this person we could not hire external. We could not find someone intern like no one could do this role better than the person we have. So again this whole thing is all about just the people like if you have the right people on the team then it doesn't matter. I mean it does but like you'll figure out how to get it done. So chief of people absolute rockstar came up in the company from I yeah to be basically being a coach leading all the coaches over here in chief of people was doing like an operator role for a minute but we all realized it's like best for that their zone of genius is in the people and the understanding of that as well as the product delivery so moved into this I should make a video on this on like how the actual chunks and evolution not just an overview but we're here now so um she leads this so we have an HR manager because everyone on this entire thing except some of the some of them are contractors like a few for like siloed positions but we wanted to move into a more structurally sound and like long-term vision and that was moving everyone to W2. So we have an HR manager and have 105 people or something like that uh or five team right now that are W2 employees in the US. So benefits 401k all the jazz. So costs instantly 20% up. I don't know that I would recommend it or when I would recommend it to someone. uh you do need to do it for compliance at a certain point, but if you ever have dips in cash collected as we did and this is me sharing, you know, what we learned like it it hurts because you have everyone who's in base salaries, you know, you have sales reps that are no longer just draw that are just, you know, 10% or whatever your commission numbers are. It is you're paying them no matter what across these ranges and everyone for that matter. Um so yeah, your floor goes up and then just your general cost. If you were paying 100K every two weeks in payroll, now you're paying 120 rough numbers. Um, but yeah, so and our numbers are far higher than that. So, HR manager, uh, CS manager, ours is a rockstar here. So, the, uh, CS manager overlooks the CS reps, which are going to be, um, in all the email combos, and we do onboarding calls for all the clients. So, they do all the onboarding, uh, calls before they get over to their coach for the actual fulfillment of the product. So, it's like sales rep to CS rep to coach. uh a billing admin who just lives inside of our Stripe and managing the data and making sure that things are marked as new when people do PIFFs um you know custom payment plans all that kind of stuff uh renewals and then also manages uh all of the emails that come in so all of the customer support emails um because a lot of them are billing oriented almost all of them um and then community we have community manager that does both the we have two groups as of now that we've had that do we have like a free group that's included in the emails and you know for the low ticket and stuff when we tested in the and uh the paid group which is or the you know VIP community group which is our high ticket uh coaching community. So yeah, that is them that live in CS. Uh premier coaches, we have three I believe right now. I think we at one point we're up to four or five um that overlook the rest of the coaches. Um this is in the fitness specific coaching. So these are onetoone coaches with clients. Each coach will have you know ramp up but will then sit around 50 to 75 or so um clients per coach. And these are also W2 employees. So they have 401k benefits security in that way. Um and again rockstar coaches and you guys can see on the site and stuff they have every accreditation and thing you can have. So yeah and that's the structure. So I'm sure I am u missing a small chunk but then operationally CS manager, sales manager, sales director, chief of people, CTO, CMO and CEO which I didn't throw on here but just basically overarching. So we are all the ones that sit in the operations meeting. We'll have a once a week and I'll go I'll have another video again where I go over like meeting cadence and stuff like that. But that's the operations meeting that we'll have once a week and everyone is basically breaking down their chunk. What are their goal? Where's the goal at? Uh what are the projects that are within this? Are they hitting KPIs and this uh across each section department and then a lot of the time in any company uh you can just easily identify like you know uh for example calendars are booked half and the rest of the company is downstream affected that. So it's like okay at some level like what's the one big thing? What's the one main thing that we can focus on? That's like how can the rest of the departments you know continue to do their thing but almost proactively try and help the bottleneck right now which is marketing for example. So can CS pull a bunch of reviews that we can use because that'll get more social proof and that'll work. Uh can sales start hitting the pipeline harder and start to lean into outbound more uh of the CRM because the bookings aren't coming in direct from marketing. um can t figure out automations and flows to make it so we can squeeze the people that are coming in and get a higher percent of lead to app or lead to booking or whatever for example. Um so yeah or same thing with tech um or actually not same thing with tech that one's a little harder not really not as easy to come in and help but like same thing with sales uh automation so we can come into here uh renewals that we can do on the product side to make it so revenue stays up across this uh as we scale through or as we scale through like the rougher times. So yeah, this is the general gist. And again, um I can make a better video on like here's where it was at this point, here's where it was at this point, here's where it was, and then here's where it is, right? Because we've like refined, but we've also we're getting a little bit wider. Um but we're refined. And then same thing with comp plans gets crazy, but um a lot of these are more fixed positions, fixed positions, commission based like kind of scaled positions. um quantity or like volume, so like how many clients you have, style you can increase uh pay, and then uh more or less fix. And then each one do have like their own little versions of bonus pools um depending on how close they are to the customer and how close they are to like what they can manage. Um and then these basically are all performance driven, like hard like leaning way heavier in performance driven. Um, so yeah. So, uh, I will update this as we go and get kind of further into this. Uh, so far I've basically just shared videos on the funnel and kind of some of the like stuff behind the funnel and how it was structured and how we did there. But I want to get more into like what we're doing now and what's working. Maybe like week update because right now it's like March 2025. We're hiring CMO or our CMO just started officially. Uh, center manager starting officially. 19 other fun updates. But yeah, I don't really know how to share these in a good clean way, but figured this would be helpful and more of like a operation structural view of it, not just, hey, here's our marketing pages and kind of how the flow works. So yeah, I will continue to make these and if you have any questions, Instagram's probably best. And talk soon.
