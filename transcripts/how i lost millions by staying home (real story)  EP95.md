What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about how staying isolated cost me millions. We're going to go through the hidden cost, the compounding effect this caused, how to get into highle rooms, what I'm calling the proximity rule, the online version of this, and my plan to fix my 10 years of isolation. All right. Last year, we did $30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 76 million in total cash collected. I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what didn't work for us, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. I am in transit. I have to do video today, and this is the only time I have on a 30 minute layover. So, we're going to get right into it. Sorry for the audio. So, the hidden cost, uh, I mean, frankly, I literally stayed locked inside for like 10 years. Um, in terms of like business and and networking, doing all these things. Um, so what happened over that time is you you have friends that don't have similar interests, which is not necessarily a problem. Um, but it can become annoying to, you know, your I call them old friends, but like your original friends, your hometown friends love dearly. Um, and same thing with family, partner, whatever. But like when they're the only people that you have as an outlet to talk to about what you're doing, um, you end up almost like living two lives, right? You have your personal life and you have a professional life. Um, and a lot of people, if you see, you know, you play the comparison game and see these people online, they do what seems to be one, uh, one life combined. Uh, and for a long time, that wasn't it for me, right? So um living two lives or you have this whole personal life that you do and then you have this whole professional which is very normal common for like most people. Um but there is a compounding effect and there is a a cost to that when you do it in these two different buckets where you're only in it in this and then in it in this uh and I do believe in obviously having separation and having like a personal life and doing that stuff even if I don't do it perfectly well. Um but when you're trying so hard to grow in the business side of things um you're essentially you know missing this leverage of what you get from being around other people even just having other friends. So like when you're only working with people and that's the only kind of connection you have and that's what I had for like 10 years was my only connection or talk about work was with work people which then become friends for sure but like it just is it's just different. All right. So, um, getting into that then the compounding, if I look back, I mean, the the missed mentorships and deals and the whole reason this is all coming up is cuz I just got back from a big event. Um, and like a trip that was all it was just insane how much value I got just out of being in the room with the people more so than the actual like the content was amazing that was in the room and at the event. Um, but it was much more about the people in the room and then even staying a couple days longer and then people I got to network with while there. Um, that so and so is friends with, you know, next connection away. Uh and then same thing with this online version of everyone who's in DMs and you know that I'm having conversations with now. It's like it's astounding to me. Uh I'm 90 whatever four or five days into doing this and actually like being public and I have literally like high hundreds of people that I'm now connected with that can help with this or this or this. So like I've obviously missed out on mentorships, deals, opportunities, not like talent, all the things just by not doing this. And I'm only doing like an online version as of now. Um, this is like my first time honestly like going out of the house basically. So, um, you know, if this then that, like if you met this person and then had this connection or if you were all, you know, side by side doing this. Like I have so many of these and I'm trying to kind of like reduce that. And again, sorry for the audio. I'm literally in an airport, but like I got to get this video out. So, um, I just have so many if this and I'm just trying to be like cognizant of that that it happened. It's over. It's gone. I can't do anything about it. I only have right now. So, I'm like hitting it so hard. It's because I'm seeing the opportunity that exists. um skills times eyeballs. There's a way better say this and I can't remember what it is, but essentially like even if you have all these high skills, you don't have eyeballs. Even if that's just friends, not even like an audience or whatever. We're not even talking about audience today at all. This is all about just literally friends and connections you have and network uh actually, you know, is your impact. So, there's a caveat to that and like obviously throughout this like we've made good money, we've got done good things without any of this um because we do still have leverage through whatever, right? Through team, through media, through ads. It's like there's people who are completely anonymous that have very limited friends and can still crush it if like financial is your metric. Um, but if your metric is like friends and like network and like access to this and that and like the ability to do whatever like you need people to do that and I have played the short game of not doing that for a very very long time. Um, and it's definitely like hurt me. Um, or just I've I haven't lived up to the opportunity of it. So now we're going to talk about high level rooms because I think this is kind of like the key of what I'm trying to get at. So for me, this one we just went to was considered like a mastermind event. Uh, usually I avoid going to like anything. So I my kind of like plan on this that I'll get into down here, but the main places and these are quick things I have done over the last years, but like mastermind events huge. So like the right people in the right because a lot of time these are framed more as like yes, there's presentations, but it's really more about like who's in the room uh and like who you're talking to and the dinners and the in between and all that kind of stuff more so than like the actual content. Conferences can be very similar. Um, so you have like your vendor rooms generally, you have like your main stage presentation, but these are also like meant to be like, you know, like if you talked about uh if I was talking to uh Carlos, like he was like, "Oh, you know, the uh chandelier bar." So all these lead genen guys, they all go to almost all the events and like all of the actual like deals and like connections get done outside of the room. Uh, which is very cool, but again, like I haven't really leaned into that. Like I've gone to a couple of them. And I mean, I went to one, this is so bad, but I went to one that I went completely alone and literally met no one. I flew across the world. I'm not going to talk about this, but like I flew across the world to go to an affiliate conference cuz I was like, "Oh, maybe I can do affiliate when this was like years ago." And I literally talked to no one except like random people I met that were not even part of the conference and just like party and like kind of try to like do my thing to meet people and I got zero value for because I didn't do anything right. I was like so shy and like didn't do whatever. It was terrible. So like do these the right way. Um paid and free groups. What I mean by this is and I talked about this in other videos but like I've met the some of the core people I've met have been inside of paid groups. So, like a paid course, paid coaching, paid whatever. And then I'm inside the groups. And I'm usually not that vocal in them, but like I'll see the people who stand out because they're vocal in them because they actually have that skill. And um I've met a lot of good people. That's how I met Luke. That's how like all of this started. Um and a lot of cool people have been met through that. And as well as free groups. They have free groups on Facebook. They have them everywhere. And I'll go into that in the online version. Um but then the big thing is really like being able to just go to the dinners, go to the trips, know people to, you know, group up with and go to trips. And that can be as just like completely friendly. It can be business related. It can be, you know, both. But when your friends are people who also do similar stuff of work or, you know, adjacent stuff, and I'll get into that. Um, but you can just learn so much. You can provide value. They can provide a ton of value. They can know someone that they can connect you with. Like that happened like 500 times um in the last 4 days. Um, and it's just like so eye opening to me. So, proximity rule of this, location, location, location. So, online is like one whole bucket, but we're going to talk about like the inerson version. the being able to like live with people like be near them and like live life with them was like a really interesting thing I I heard a lot of these guys like when we were just in London talk about so they go to dinners constantly like with their friends with their with their boys with the girls like they go out and do that and also side tangent I have like 98% male so when I say guys and this and that like that's what this is about but like I'm very I I just don't know anyone in the space or no one reaches out that is that but dinners trips cigars whatever they like constantly there are constantly doing these things together and like you see it all over social you see it on X you see it on Instagram you see it wherever and like I've just never had that where I have like friends that I go out and do these things with where we also talk about work and when I'm like so work focused it's always been like for me dinners are like with my friends friends but we don't talk about that and again I'm like annoying when I talk about this kind of stuff and like that's not my goal and right so you almost like shy away and don't want to talk about it um and then you just like resort to kind of doing this online version but I think there's so much value in doing it like actually in person being able to do that and then having the uh environment. So for the online version, this is basically what I'm doing now, but what I still did not do for like 10 years. So you see like Instagram, a lot of people use it for like the visual I mean honestly most of the guys I know literally either do it for like to optimize for you know mating or they optimize it for business and that's kind of it. And like I am not I you know mine just existed and like I still don't even know how to use it but like I want to only use it for business like it just strictly for workrelated style stuff. X I've used now as a platform that then kind of fuels into YouTube which is funny because I feel like it's kind of usually the other way around but like that's kind of how it's worked for me. This has been huge value ad. The only people I'm connect with here are business. Uh and I like this YouTube has been an outlet for me to obviously do things like this which is like a lot of out like spewing and like output which I'm not a super fan of honestly. Um and it's not very like connection oriented but it has led to tons of connections because of what I'm putting out which I like a lot. Facebook uh it used to be like the biggest thing especially for like the high ticket space and like info coaching like all the info guys were on there and that was because of the traffic funnels of the world and school at the time or not school uh consulting at the time or ovens and whatever like all those groups were on Facebook and that was just like the place to have groups that's where all the internet marketers were because they were in paid groups or they were in paid courses and communities that had their group on Facebook so everyone's like friends you click on anyone and there's like you know everyone has 300 mutual friends so this but then the groups were really the key here and there's some really good ones uh nothing held back group by Alen Sultanic. That one has like I don't even know 50,000 8,000 something members in it and that has a bunch of good people. Now it's turned into like W school whatever. These are generally there are free ones but there's a lot of paid groups in here which I think are super super valuable. I'm actually not in any of these that I actively am in but I would like to. And then the core core ones end up in iMessage, WhatsApp and Telegram. So iMessage start like I've heard on a lot of podcasts like oh you know like the ecom hitters and like these top guys that do 50 100 whatever million have like groups where they just share what's working now I'm in paid groups like um like the AFL one I'm in for example like they use WhatsApp um and a couple other good ones use that telegram this is a big one for crypto uh for lead genen for affiliate for everything honestly but like all of these have their own like pockets of this so you're basically doing this but just like digitally which is cool but like it is missing a flavor like a piece of it um that I think is like really really valuable. So just as like a recap before we go into my plan to fix it. Um so I'm just bummed honestly I'm just bummed that I missed out on a lot of this and there's kind of only way to just look forward and just be like okay what can I change about that? Um the amount of compounding that I miss that I see if I was to do like you know comparison game is like nutty. uh absolutely insane like just sitting in London and like everyone who knows everyone and they're playing this they're you know sport together doing breakfast here going on whatever and talk about the trips they all go on and then oh so and so mets like I just I missed it right so now I'm trying to do the other direction of compounding I basically compound down and now I'm trying to compound up in doing this um high level rooms I'm just going to like literally you know I've just seen how valuable these are to be in the right room especially the paid to play ones and it's kind of like counterintuitive cuz there's probably ones that are free that are like amazing but there's something about like people who pay to So there's the outlier of people who you're like, "Okay, wow." Um, but a majority of the time like the people in the room are all there for the same reason, which is like a really good thing. Um, proximity thing, moving, living near, doing all that, like this is huge. Um, and then you all kind of like grow together, which I think is really cool. Um, and then the online version is really, you know, exactly what I say it is, which is essentially what I'm doing right now. So, my plan to fix it. So, I want to start doing essentially like some version of like a monthly trip. I don't know if it's going to be monthly. just threw, you know, cadence on here, but call it every 60 days, 90 days. Um, I want to make a whole another video on how I'm going to start to like break out the work in personal because I think it's really important and I've been like botching that. So, I want to focus on doing like a quarterly one. Ovens used to have a thing that was like he does a force time off every 90 days. Um, and I know like, you know, Iman has his stuff and like I'm talking about all these like big guys, but like you know, it's who I used to consume content of like I just consumed a ton of content for 10 years. These guys used to have examples of how they would do, you know, 90-day sprints and then go do like relaxation trips and stuff and that that's more on the personal side of things. But on the business or connection side, it's like, okay, per right now I live somewhere that does not have an active community of this. So like monthly trips to places that there are or just big cities. So think of your Londons, think of your Scottsdale, think of your Miami, think of your Dubai, think of like these places um that are like kind of hot spots for what we do for work, right? Info coaching, um agency, SAS, whatever, lead genen. So, uh, doing monthly trips where I can be in a cadence of being around people that do it. Conferences and events, I'm just going to start going to all of them. Um, I don't even need to necessarily go to the actual event or just like be there. Like I went to the lead genen, uh, one that was in Vegas and like we don't even get tickets for it. Um, and you know, you talk to the guys and it's like you actually meet the people in the vendor rooms and you do real business in there, but you also like if you have a foot in, you already know somebody or you kind of have whatever you can say you're there, you can meet XYZ, they know someone, there's some event, there's some party, there's some whatever you can go to. So, I'm going to start uh making sure that I prioritize these and do them in an intentional way where it's like, oh, this is the next layer of what we want to learn or get around, not just like go to go. So, that's going to be a big one. Uh I'm going to move. So, uh again, I'm in a location right now. That was just kind of like the next step. Um but I'm definitely going to move slash have like multiple spots. So, I like where I'm at because it's family, friends, you know, girlfriends, stuff like that. Um but the next thing is going to be going somewhere uh that will have like a um higher whatever um intensity or or concentration uh of the right people which is like a big focus for me. So again think of all those cities I said um Puerto Rico um Scottdale, London, Dubai, whatever. Um and then maybe even have multiple spots that I can bounce around to. That would be a different game for a different reason. Um but do something like that. Uh another thing that someone was talking about that I had never even thought of was like living with people. Um, so I've never done this uh ever really. Like I don't think I literally have ever had like a roommate in like the last 10 years. Um, but people are talking about how like popular this is. Same thing with trips. It's like you're constantly like with people and in groups. So you're like bouncing things off. You're not just like in your own head or just like only doing the online version. Uh, I don't know if I want to do that and I don't really know if my life's in a place where that makes sense for me, but like I know it makes sense for a lot of people. Um, so moving multiple spots, being actually open to doing this and like having the concept of this um, because I just have been so shy away like not doing for a long time. Another big one that I need to figure out is like this personal CRM or like have an EA or something. Um because I have hundreds of people and I am like already losing track of it and it's like one's on WhatsApp, one's on Telegram, one's on iMessage, everything's on Instagram, everything's on X and I'm like completely moving losing track of them. Uh which I don't love. Um excuse me. So I've heard these are like just a mess, but like there's definitely a way to do this. And then yeah, building a system around this entire thing. So, building a system around the cadence, building a system around how I store these, building a system around how I set up everything, dinners, events, calls, meetings, whatever. And then like right now, I'm kind of doing a version of it with these like, you know, what's working now conversations I'm doing where I get to meet these people. But like, you know, having proper data on this and like where people live and like when, you know, there's overlap or there's trips or event people going to just keeping a pulse on that so I have a system so I can actually have the touch points because I know me and I will fall things will fall through the cracks. I will miss stuff. I will not follow up correctly. Um, and also just like stuff like this for me is going to be very it's going to be much easier for me to like basically be able to remember the important things. Like I'm I'm pretty bad at that. And I think it's pretty important to do that with like personal relationships. Like I don't want to use this as like a oh I just like hit people up when I need something. Like that's not my goal and like to have shallow relationships. Um but at the same time like let's be honest like you have hundreds of people it's going to be very difficult to remember all the details. Uh and I want to be able to do that in a good way. So I'm not just coming to story like oh yeah yo like remind me of this and this like and you know you don't know anything about their family their personal life their whatever if they've already shared it with you like that's not cool and I know me and I will drop the ball on that. So I want to build a system around it have all these things. So yeah that's the general gist cost me probably tens and tens. I mean we've I I was going to do a video uh today about how we lost you know or not lost but opportunity cost loss whatever you want to call it. Um lost like 50 probably million on just things that I've learned but I'm like oh we could have done this different. I could have done this. In hindsight, it's like 2020 for sure, but just some real obvious ones after being at some of these events that I'm like, "Oh, wow. Did we drop the ball on that?" Oh, wow. Did we drop the ball on that? But this was top of mind. So, I wanted to share this with you guys. Um, I have like, you know, x amount of hours left until the end of the day and I literally have a layover and I have to get to a flight. So, I'm going to have to cut this one shorter than usual. Um, but yeah, all the videos are here. I have a couple good uh www.rankclug.comdoc is all the videos. I've done this 95 days in a row. I'm going to 100 before phase two, which I think I'm going to switch up the cadence and I have something cool to announce uh around there that has come specifically or directly from this. So, pretty excited for that and uh yeah, that's what I got. So, I'll talk to you guys soon and uh keep crushing it. Hit me up on IG if you have any questions.
