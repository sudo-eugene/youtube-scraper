# How to Scale Info/Coaching in 2025 (Live Q&A)
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EDHaUd3OA0

What's up, guys? We are back with the weekend Q&A round 11. You guys submitted all of these questions here to the request box over the last week or so, and today I'm going to answer every single one of them. Everything from low ticket offers to secrets to accountability, a lot of context on where people are stuck or in ideiation, which I love to answer these ones. All the things picking an offer and market, business model choice. This is going to be a good one. Haven't done this in a minute. So excited. All right. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 82 million in total cash collected and we are currently doing a record month. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. I have caffeine and I have nicotine and I am prepared. Talk about your new low ticket offer. How it's talk about how your new low ticket offer is doing and the things you've done to optimize it. All right. So, I actually was thinking about using this little like pencil thing over here for the first time. So, we run Oh, no. There's no way I'm doing that. Uh, we run ads direct to a low ticket and with the goal of it ascending. Okay, so the difference on how we mainly focus on these. A lot of people will do AOV focus. So, they will send to um a low ticket that'll then ascend up and have like a 297 with an OTO1 and then a down cell and then this and this. Our entire goal of ours is to get ascension into our high ticket. And we do that by having on the thank you page pushing them to book a call that is actually with a setter that um kind of acts like a CS and setter. So it's like did you get access to all the stuff? Here's what you're going to get. And then also why didn't you apply for the main thing and then if they're a good fit, they'll then set them with the closer and go. So the biggest issue we've had on this thus far is being able to scale it into cold traffic at the volume and size we want to. Um because let's say you're getting a 4% ascension rate. So I'm gonna do math on my phone just because every time I do math on the freaking thing it like shows everything on my screen. Um so if you are getting let's say it cost you $50. So you sell something for $50 and it cost you $100 to get the purchaser. Okay? So 100us 50 is a $50 net cost and then 4% of those people ascend. Okay? So of those people of the 100 people that purchase that 4% ascend. That's a $1,200 $1,250 cost per your back-end program, your high ticket, the thing you're sending them into. Okay, so that's the model we're playing. Now, the biggest issue for us is when we scale over X number of units right now, the math breaks. Okay, so the economics are great up until a certain point. And that's just because it's not really built as much for cold traffic um as much as it is almost as like a retargeting asset. So, we are building a new low ticket offer um that is more cold friendly, but we are trying to do it in a way that we're just kind of like the new one that we're talking about is like, okay, cool. Can we do a time based one? And we don't do anything that's time based, but a ton of people do. So, like imagine like uh 14 days to get fit or like the fiveday um you know, trading master class or something that's like this low ticket offer. Um, but the issue with those that were h the hypothesis is that that's going to be hard to ascend people because they are going to not want to get on a call and talk to someone about some other thing until they've consumed x amount of days versus an info product where you just sell um something right there. They get instant access. They already have everything and it's like, oh, and this other thing versus they don't know what's to come in future days. So, they're like, "Oh, I want to consume this before I do this." So, we may have shot ourselves in the foot a little. Um, and those maybe work better for actual like AOV plays, so with upsells and stuff. So, we'll see how that goes. But, we have not even launched the other one yet because we care so much about brand and quality and all this stuff. So, it takes us a little bit longer to launch things and we're a little bit more corporate, which I don't love all the time, but I do like that we maintain the branding quality. So, all to say still has the best best economics in the entire company until a certain threshold and we cannot scale beyond that in current state. Um, we're also doing some things with like what we're doing for lists and like how we're emailing like where the traffic comes to this. Um, because if it's just cold and then all the optim optimizations that occur within there, it's like at XYZ dollars, but when we we can market it to other lists that we have, we can market it to like people who came in through VSSL funnels. We can do all these things that we like haven't been doing, which is stupid. Um, and we just figured out and like the cost is insanely dropped because obviously we're getting traffic that's for free or included in what we've already paid for. So hopefully that answers Sup, Ryan. What's your secret to accountability? What do you use to track your day, the things you did, and be actually consistent? What do you look for in a team to make things spicier? Okay, I got to go one by a time. Oh, Blick. What up, G? Um, secret to accountability. So, I've had a major issue with this for a long time. Um, not major, but there's been periods of my life where this has been literally zero or negative where you like can't even trust yourself to do XYZ. Um, but like stack the little wins has been a big one that I was always taught and told and that has worked for me. So like you say you're going to get up at 5 am every day like get up at 5 am every day and like make like keep a promise that you have with yourself um for the accountability portion. Um a lot of people do like friend accountability like accountability partners. I don't really do that um that much. Um I'm going to make a YouTube video every single day for 30 days turned into 120 days like just to keep the promise to myself at some level. And it was I was getting a feedback loop. Feedback loop is big. um being able to get that back. Um how I then track my day, I just live by the calendar. I could do a better job with this because like right now as I'm like pulling away at things. So like I pulled back the YouTube thing every day. I pulled back um a lot of the meeting structure and cadence I have and implement have team in place that are doing these things. It's like my day is starting to free up again and like me with a free day is like the worst thing on the planet for me. Like I just I I like lose it all. So I like to be busy. Um which is probably another internal issue or something that I can solve for. But I usually track everything based on the calendar. So or plan everything for the calendar and then viciously execute what's based on the calendar. How I actually track things that I did. Um I mean it's generally like a look back. I keep stupid simple to-do lists like based on like what bucket. So like this company, this company, this personal thing, this whatever. Like I have a personal bucket. I have like main co. I have like side quests. And then I kind of have health, but I've actually dropped off that one a lot. Like I still go to the gym every day, but like it's just there. Um, but yeah, so I track those in like to-do lists and I actually delete the thing after it's on the to-do list, not check it off, which kind of like I've heard people are like, "Yeah, it doesn't you don't ever feel like you completed anything, but like I don't give a shit." So, uh, what do I look for in a team? A self starter. Someone who goes above and beyond. Someone who asks questions when they need, but just knows how to like go in and try and solve something for themselves. Somebody who Yeah. Someone who doesn't like ask me a bunch of questions as much. Like I'm I'm literally down to help all the time. But I think I've almost gone too far in the direction sometimes where it's like I've gone too far in the directions both times where it's like they just got this like handle it. And then also like I'm going to micromanage the [ __ ] out of this and like both have not worked. So like that dance in between is like let's be collaborative but like you run this and like give them the autonomy to do so. Um I don't want to know skill sets or mindset. What's the smallest hint that separates a talker from a competent person? Uh I think you can tell very quickly in a conversation with someone. I just messaged someone on uh Instagram who I met at an event and I was like great like one of the best talks I had there cuz I literally ran into him on the way to the bathroom and we talked in the hallway and like 12 seconds in I was like oh like 30 seconds in I was like oh he knows what's like going on or like oh within this domain he like really knows what's going on. Um I would classify myself as a yapper as of recent. I never really was a yapper, but now I kind of just yap a lot and I think I could be better at that and more articulate and um you know, even this I'm seven and a half minutes in. Like I could have answered this more direct. Um but that's not really what these are for. So I think that's a big one is you can tell when someone knows their [ __ ] You can tell when someone knows like a percent about something or you know they're like, "Oh yeah, well that's okay. What's the number for this?" Or, "Oh, okay. That's interesting." Or like, "Oh, like they use words too." Like depending on what domain you're talking about. If I was I'm not competent about tennis, but if you would ask me a question about tennis, like I would be the a talker or like wouldn't know what to say. But if you ask me something about this, I could be like the most competent person in the room potentially. Like there's different domains, too. So, I don't know. Hopefully, that makes sense. If you currently had a 9 to5 but have an immense desire to start something, how would you start? How would you set up your time? Uh what specific skills, actions would you start taking today? Yeah, you just got to learn a skill set that people are willing to pay for and then just do it outside of your hours. I mean, or on top of your hours, but I'm not a super fan of that because I have team members and I would not be thrilled if they were doing it on my time slash, you know, company time. So, yeah, I would just learn a skill set. So, marketing is the one that our world kind of plays into. So, there's a lot of guys who do like affiliate lead genen, that's all marketing, almost exclusively, all marketing. Um, that's running ads, that's doing creatives, that's doing copy, that's doing all those things. Um, there's local business ones that are service based. So like anything that ends up being a service based because when you do lead genen affiliate and all that you're spending money that could just be zero versus service you're just selling your time um which is not you know that as big of a deal like you only have so much of it sure but at the same time like it's an easier way and a much higher margin way to do it. Um so yeah I would just start there just learn a skill set and then deploy it. I've talked about this a lot but like learn something that's hot now. So anything in marketing anything that what do companies need? What do people need? They need more clients. They need more uh retention. They need more sales. They need more whatever. So, you just pick one of those and actually stick to it. Don't do everything. Just do one thing and just learn it and then do it outside your 9 to5. So, do your 5 to9, you know, 5 to 9, right? 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. And it sucks and you I mean, if that's not your speed, but sometimes it's what it takes if you have to be locked into this. I love your take on my situation. Me and my buddy just started offering design services. How would you get your first client fast? I would do work for free and I would put my stuff everywhere until I get in and then I know kids are getting a [ __ ] ton of clients. They have no clue about design by the way if any of your viewers shill. No thanks. Uh I'm currently growing a BTOC bisop offer that teaches remote appointment setting to 9to5ers through a course, onetoone coaching model, and placement help. Okay, so you have a course, you then onetoone coach them and you place them. Trying to crack the call funnel right now. running ads targeting employed people looking for an extra income stream. I've tested optins, Insta forms, and direct app, but most leads are coming in unqualified because they have low savings and cost per booking is around current currently spending $100 a day. So, you're getting two a day. I'm considering testing an AI angle where our I don't know why I said AI like that. Uh where our in-house AI does most of the heavy lifting on DMs for them, reducing perceived effort, but not sure if it's going to over complicate the message. Couple of quick questions. I'd love your take on you think the AI angle. So when you're saying AI angle, you mean like so you're just instead of having a setter, it's AI. So it's not like a marketing angle. It's like a how you're talking to them. Or would it dilute the core offer? I don't know why. If it was just pretending to be a person as long as it's good, that's fine. Yeah, I could do heavy lifting on DM for them. Reducing perceived effort. Oh, for them. So okay. Well, I get what you're saying. So grow that teaches remote appointment setting to 9 to5. So someone is learning repo remote appointment setting. Yes, you can use AI as like an angle to be like this is how we do this thing. But like again that's how to do the job. Right here you're trying to even teach them what remote appointment setting is. So that's more of like a piece of the puzzle and like part of the mechanism not like what you're educating them on like what you're convert like what you're teaching them to do. So, no, I don't think it would dilute the core offer, but I don't think it's like you could layer it in. So, it's like how to become a a remote appointment setter that a I don't know. I don't know how to do that right now, but like that does, you know, some XYZ through AI because you're teaching them like here's what you're going to become and here's this crazy mechanism on how you do it and like that your USP on how you do it. Uh, what price point would you recommend? I have no idea. Um, I have no idea. But I mean, you're saying all these people have low savings. So to come up to this, direct to app is probably best for this, especially if you're not if you want like people on your calendar um for cost per book call. Clearly the messaging and your and your targeting and everything is getting people very low savings so people can't afford it. So how you do the pricing is like what's the value, right? So like if someone's going to go and all of a sudden like setters make like three five grand a month, right? Like or more. I mean, I've heard people make eight and whatever, but like call it five. So, what is it worth to learn how to make 60 grand a year if they're already making 60 grand a year or whatever, right? But now they get to do it remote and this can that. Is it 2500 bucks? Is it 5,000? Like any of those are over the phone anyway. So, I have five to six results screenshots. How do I speedrun through more case studies? get a bunch more people at lower price point if you really want to like actually test this, but that's not going to prove that you can sell at that price obviously because you're doing that. But like if you're just doing it for case studies, you're I feel like you're just like there's different things going on here. So AI could angle could convert better. Yes. Layering it into the USP up here of how to do it. That's not going to solve for getting more qualified people though. So the qualified people is how you're targeting and what your messaging is saying up here. Okay? And what the offer is. Once you have the offer in there dialed in, layer in that AI and go into the offer. Cool. No, it will not dilute it. Price point, I don't know, 2500, 5,000. I don't know what the market asks for this. I don't know what other people sell this for. Um, I think Cole has one that does it. Cole crushes and like owns this domain right now. Um, I have five to six solid results from previous clients. How do you get more case studies? I always go with the lower like what's the the lowest hanging fruit on how to do this is like literally if you want to go crazy, do it for free. like literally pay people like if you're trying to just solve for this, if you're trying to solve for the whole thing in one, you speedrun it by actually getting this to work so that you do get real results and then that people then you can use it. So hopefully that was helpful. Sorry, a little confusing. Any tips for getting over fear whether mind for launching a new offer whether mindset or tactical tips feels a lot different than taking organic face who's already been trust and teach and launching them to cold. obviously having backend dialed in but struggling to stop researching more setups. No, just launch it. Absolutely. Just launch it. Um but go low budgets. Like I have a great example of this the other day. Launch something. Um I was talking to a group and they were like, "Yeah, blah blah blah. Like how do you want to do this?" And I was like, "Yeah, like three three to 500 bucks a day, which should be XYZ." And they had all these ads and all this stuff done and they launched at three to five grand a day. and tech is breaking and messaging isn't hitting and cost per call is like in the like thousand plus and I'm like what is going on like why are we doing this like we need to me like we need to run this at a lower budget so I would just do that I would just run at a lower budget especially if you're saying you have organic when you do retargeting or like run an ASC campaign or whatever and it picks up cold and and uh warm like one your stats are going to be like puffed up right off the rip because you are going to be hitting people that already see your face. When you're truly getting into cold, that's when you're like spending into pockets that you haven't even hit yet. So, starting at low budgets is like the triple safe way to do this because you're likely going to land on retargeting people and you're not spending that much money and they've already seen your f and and and uh and then as it begins to scale up, your stats very likely will decrease, right? Um or more so like your results will decrease, your costs will go up. And when doing that, you can then more or less like tweak it real time and see what you need to change for cold and see how your math backs out. Like right here, having your back end dialed, knowing your numbers. Um, so yeah, I think this is I mean you're you're good. Just launch them. Just launch them at low. Do 30, 50 bucks a day. Do 100 bucks a day. Do something like that. And then start to see the cadence, start to see the stats. uh have them on dedicated pages so you have dedicated data because you don't want it to mix with organic or you're going to like again puff up your data more and think it's like crushing even if it's directly not. Um so yeah, just set up it itself dedicated. Does this funnel make sense? Uh would you change anything? I'm launching a paid community hosted on school specifically for beginners in business. What kind of business goes into business psychology, marketing, sales, product offer development, biohacking and selfmastery all structured from two years. all structured from over two years of focused work and refinement. Right now, I'm only active on Twitter, but I have a Telegram channel. You have two assets. For the past year, I've been dropping two to three voice notes a week to build trust, over value, and warm my audience. When I launch, I'm personally DMing every every member, and I'll send them a 30 to minute 30 to 60 minute community thesis video that breaks down the vision, the transformation, the structure of the offer. I like these a lot, by the way. I like when people just give the offer. Um 30 to 60 is kind of crazy. Like, you could do it in like 7 to 12 minutes is what this like. I see a lot of people do that. So, it's like literally here's what you're going to get. Here's what the breakdown is. Here's why I'm launching it here. Here's my experience. Here's like what the offer is. Click here, book a call or buy right here or do whatever. Um 30 to 60 is like generally for someone who doesn't have the consumption of x amount of years like you're saying or however much content uh or consumption that they've already had with you. This is like VSSL webinar land where you're like hard selling someone on something. So, um from there, I'll qualify and sell via DM with an option to jump on a quick call. Did you say price on here? Yeah, I'm pricing the community at 997. 997 is low enough that you can sell it direct without having to talk on the phone, but I love talking on the phone because you can like change the offer. You can sell someone thing for 10K. You can sell something for 50K. You could sell something for 500 bucks. Like you get to it's more malleable when it's on the phone. But you're going all in on YouTube with Telegram is the only CTA. I'll be pitching community inside Telegram. Um I don't really necessarily understand who your target is other than just like general beginners. Um the issue with that is like not having a specific result is very difficult. So within serious beginners who know who don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing yet but are hungry to change that. Yeah. So the biggest issue with I think with beginners is like yes cool. You like want this foundational stuff. A lot of time you can learn this through doing a specific thing though. And when you're not selling a specific outcome, it's like you're going to tell them it's $1,000, I assume, for lifetime access to the community with all of these courses in them. And it's like for what? Like what are they paying $1,000 for? Oh, all these things. But like what's the outcomes? Like they're going to be a better business person, but they have no experience as a business person. Like you're not teaching them based on this a specific thing. Then you probably have that in your community thesis. It's like this is how I'm going to teach you to get to your first 10K or whatever. I don't know. I don't do MMO. I don't do beginners. I don't know how that works. U as well. But like generally speaking, that's why you see everyone be like how to get to your first 10K through this method and whatever that they've never heard of PDF farming or drop shipping or whatever. Um versus like here's how you become a business person, an online business person by the sounds of this. Like that's what I see as the biggest issue here. And then same thing with this, like if you already have a warm audience, like you can beta, you can talk to people on the phone. I do like talking to people. I like the idea of talking to people on the phone. Um, but yeah, I hope that kind of makes sense. Best channels to reach small to medium-siz businesses, brickandmortar, any business that uses a payment terminal like a square or a toast as an agency. So if that's as an agency, been struggling to scale um past familiar connections and referrals. Referrals are hot. I know a guy that does a referral like partnership business that does 110 million a year strictly from referrals um in a similarish style thing here. Um so there's a lot of payment guys on X that could probably help you a lot better than me. Um but in just generally speaking if you're like I need some I need physical inperson brickandmortar businesses that have payment terminals like where do they hang out? What events do they go to? Who's already dominating the pay uh the the space? And then if you have some unique thing then using whatever on LinkedIn or Facebook ads or whatever where you can target this like business like brick and mortar you can target pretty easily on LinkedIn. You can have organic around this like I don't know what the offer is if it's just like hey change off square and toast that they have their entire business like integrated with and do it for cheaper fees and like that's the only thing like a little bit harder of a sale. But if you have like this it's like an offer. It's like what's the offer? It's like, "Oh, I'm going to come in. We're going to implement a marketing system and do payment terminals and save you money here, here, here, and here, and the average business saves over 30 grand a year and fees and whatever." Like, and you have a payment calculator that this is how much you'll save, and this is how much will increase this or we have some ascension portal thing. Like I, you know, I don't know what the offer is, but like you just need a good offer and you need to get it in front of the right eyes, which is cold, which is paid, which is uh outbound, which is [ __ ] trade shows, which is referrals. So, you need the core offer and then you need multiple sources. Or I mean, you don't even need multiple sources. You just need one that you crush with and then you can have multiple. But you just need to find what pocket that is and then start with coming up with the offer that actually converts when people hear it. So what are the best strategies for improving ascension rate with low ticket ascension funnels? Um so I talked about this on the front. So the strategies are fundamentally the core of it being in congruency with what you're ascending them into. So if you sold like here's how to make your first 10K and then over here it's like here's how you do like basket weaving like I think that's what it's called. Uh that doesn't ascend. Like that doesn't make sense, right? So, versus like if you have basket weaving as your high ticket and I'll teach you exactly how to do it and I'll fly out and I'll be there side by side until you get it right. And then over here it's like how to make your first sweater or basket or whatever the [ __ ] I don't know what I'm talking about. Uh those are in congruency. It makes sense that this and then this is the next continuation of it. Agencies that sell here's how to get more clients and whatever they get in you have an ascension or you have a onboarding call. call. They get on the onboarding call where you talk about what's going on here and you're like, "Oh, also we'll do this with you or coach you on how to do this or do it for you and it's 10K instead of 1K and then it's a take rate." Watch the video on my channel with Brooke. They sell a course on this or uh they have the flow like this for high ticket USbased drop shipping and they sell a course direct through a webinar funnel. It's like a one or two ticket. They get an onboarding call and they sell, you know, 40% of them ascend into their five or 10 or 50 or whatever K offer. um that's basically just done with you or done for you. So the big thing is it's directly in alignment. It's just more implementation. It's more um it's the continuation of what it is is the number one thing. And then all the actual like little mechanisms within there is just like squeezing it. So making sure that if you have a tube step that you have a lead and then a buyer, it's like what are you hitting the lead not buyers with in in contacts and flows and uh setters once they're a buyer but they haven't booked their onboarding call. What are you doing to optimize to get them to book an onboarding call? Once they don't show, what are you doing for show rates of the of the onboarding call? Once they're on the onboarding call, what's the conversion rate? What can the scripting be and the qualification be? If the people aren't qualified, go back to the front end and change up the marketing feedback loop to make sure or give feedback to marketing to make sure that the people coming in who are buying the low ticket are somebody who will and can ascend into the high ticket. Uh once they're inside the low ticket, make sure that it's completely optimized for uh consumption and ascension. So it has book a call, it has application links, it has whatever inside there. Make sure that they're getting in a community and you're commu and putting value inside the community. And like all of those things contribute to the ascension rate. It's not just like, oh, they bought and then five like whatever percent ascend, 4% ascend, 12% ascend. I was talking to Ravi on his he has like a 13% ascension rate which crushes because there's all this value and then all these people are people who are interested in XYZ thing and the implementation of it is the ascension. So, it just makes sense for people to ascend. And because the quality of the product is so good, because the touch points are there, they ascend. So, it's like you almost like feed them the first thing and then they're ready for the next thing. Uh, and the next thing is your next program. So, hopefully that helps. Most influential realizations you had as a byproduct of wasting time and energy on BS. Um, most influential realizations. Yeah, I wasted eight a lot of years being an idiot. Um, is the biggest one. So, I just know how much output and like product. Sorry, Mike. Uh, I know how much output and potential in that direction I can have. Um, and I was just wasting it just straight up like just straight up wasting the time and energy on dumb stuff. Um, people in life, me, it was just me. I don't even blame any like there's no blame around it other than me. Um, so I just wasted Yeah. a lot of time in that. Uh, marketing, sales, ops, and scaling specific. um not understanding the economics of things and the numbers even though like I did but I didn't fully and like even right now I'm like oh yeah I understand it but I but I don't understand 90% of it then it's a constantly you know constantly learning new things and implementing new things to then learn the next thing and skill stack is like my number one thing so with sales we let it run for a very long time uh at what without any comparisons and knowing what it should be for the costs uh or for like conversion so like simple examples like oh if our close rates 15% and we're making money and we're like, "Oh, this is great." But like industry average is 30%. And like we didn't know that, let's just say. Or like ops like um not having project management systems in place or being okay with due dates being a week out because that was just the norm and we were all just like lifestyle businessing it when it could have been done same day or next day. Scaling, leaning in for vanity metrics that were like topline numbers and burning profit. And I talk about that and like how we have this overhead stack and we built to be this like 5 million plus a month company. So when you do 1.5 or 3 million a month or whatever like the margin's not there because the margin is released once it gets up there. And um understanding what the big levers are in team efficiency and in the economics of the front end and the economics of the back end. Like even now we like have not focused on LTV up until like months a couple months ago and it was like it's the most profitable part of the company and just like not understanding the numbers or not understanding the overall like business like we have made literally every mistake and are probably going to make a lot lot lot more um but like actually iterating through those. So hopefully that was helpful. But uh how would you make your first 15,000? You only have $500 and your goal is to do in in three months. learn a service, sell it for 5Gs, do three of them. So, anything from like what's hot now. So, like you can deploy um you know, use something sexy like AI, but what are you actually selling them? AI is how you're doing it, but which makes it like cool. Like the other one I talked about up here, like the USP makes it cooler. Um but what you're teaching or what you're helping a business do is like get more clients or do XYZ. um you know, we'll run your Facebook ads for you for free and once you get your first, you know, once you collect 15,000, we get our you know, we start a 5k retainer and then it's like hammer it and like create a really good offer, sell it to people, lowest barriers, performance-based generally. So, nothing upfront and then do that. You get, you know, five, 10, whatever of those in three months and then you have those three months to actually perform on the service. Once you perform on the service, you get the actual performance fees and that's your 15 GS. Like, I would do something like that. Um, it's usually the easiest because it's like you need a good enough offer that people are willing and you can get enough volume into it or you need to snipe somebody and just do one for example. But that's probably honestly the the cleanest way to do it is you land one that you know you can do it with for free that is I you know you have a 15k performance model um that you can get paid 15 grand over three months whether it's 5k a month or 15 gs after or whatever and then you perform for them. Um, and if you don't trust yourself in the skill, then yeah, I would hedge it a little bit and probably have a couple of them, but you're going to have a less likelihood to make them all achieved than just one of them. So, um, another one actually, uh, is like if you want to just work as a job and get paid for it. So, like setting you could do you could be a crush it as a setter and make 5gs a month. So, you could do it as a job um, and you get paid to learn it. You're inside a company that already has lead flow and all the things. You don't have to do it from scratch. Um, that's a really good entry point is like setting into closing. Some people take closers off the rip where it's more normal to make 10K a month, but um, it's harder to land a a closer job just off the RIP. Can you talk more about the offers you ran when you sold mid to low ticket or mid, sorry, mid-tour products? How was the offer structured and what strategy do you use to close on sales calls for things like bonus scarcity? Um, yeah, so we sold we initially sold it for $500 over the phone or I think it was actually $4.95. Um, and then it's the same product. We just increased the price to a,000 and then up to 14.95. There are some paid plans that were in-house as well. Um, majority of them were sold at scale at this 145 price. And it was just the classic info coaching model. So, it was lifetime access, which was silly, um, but clearly easier to convert. And it was uh, course access, a Facebook community, and group coaching calls like three times a week and where they could submit forms and go through all those questions. So, that's how the offer was structured. uh what did you use to uh sell on the call? Just the value of what it was. Also, all of our sales reps were um all of our sales reps were clients of the product, so it was extremely easy to sell. Um we just had to teach them a little bit of sales skills, but like it was very easy to have someone that was the exact same market demo and talking about how they had already bought it and the changes they had made and had just really good results. So, it was kind of like an easy feedback loop. Um you're trying to create an info product. I'm considering designing an offer sim similar to his OG launch where it's framed at 59 deposit that's refunded credit it to ascension when they complete the challenge. I have result-based intro version of my info product. I'm thinking about using the same free challenge offer model but not sure if it's better to just sell the info product directly on calls instead of with a free challenge. No. So the idea of the free challenge is this is Hormos's whole offer idea. Right. So, you're going to get more volume of people that come in through this than if you were to sell it directly at this $4.95. Um, so if you do the free challenge, the idea is you have more volume that that come through. It's a sexier offer. You get a higher click rate, you get a higher take rate, you get a higher join rate, and then inside there when fulfilling on it, you get a higher ascension and higher take rate. So, it's all about like lowering the friction, increasing the conversions, and getting more throughput through it. So that's why these are generally like structured like this is because if you have this free versus if you have just lose this and this and then sell it direct like the clicks on this for example is going to be double what it would be if you were like for like you know think in the other extreme but it's like uh lose 20 pounds for for $500 or whatever and it's like I maybe that is a good offer but like you have to test these different things. Um but that's the idea behind it is like the offer is good enough that it gets a higher throughput. Um, and then you have people in your ecosystem and then they consume and then they're interested and as long as you have good product and good XYZ and good like optimizations, they ascend through um, your range. Picking an offer and market. What's one market principle most people overlook but separates those who scale who are stuck at 10K. 10K a month is um, you can do a lot more than that just like with any offer in any market. Um, marketing principle that most people overlook. I guess probably the same as the last question. It's like making a good enough offer because one offer, one traffic source, one whatever is like easily how to get to hundreds of thousands a month is with one offer and one source. Whether that's organic, whether that's paid, whether that's YouTube, whatever. I mean, whatever it is, referrals, like you just have to have a good enough product, a good enough offer, and a good enough product that it works for. Um, so what's one marketing principle? Most people overlook that that it just all comes down to what that offer is. Um, and if it's good enough, then you're good. So, I would say that's kind of the biggest issue directly. Um, you seem to have scaled without much organic. How would you be able to build trust fast without organic? You talked about the value. How does that look? Uh, any channels you recommend on this specific topic? Thanks. Keep up the volume, watching every vid. Thanks, G. Um yeah, we have a ton of organic that exists as middle middle and bottom of funnel just not as like first click. So we don't have like first click attribution to they saw us on on organic first and I that's also because we pay so much so it's like um yeah it just like inherently happens. Uh how are you able to build trust fast uh with mass amounts of content and consumption? So we email twice a day. We have contextual flows. We have an intense amount of content that they can consume in multiple fashions. So we have YouTube video, we have audio podcast, we have paid VSSLs, we have free products they can consume, we have paid low ticket product they can consume. We have different ways that like depending on their mode of their type that they're interested in, you know, through whether it's a free training, whether it's just, you know, a catalog of videos, whether it's a free product, whether it's whatever they enter through there and they consume and consume and consume. We have community, a free community, we have like all these different ones. So that's what the value vortex really is. It's m value vortex is more so multiple paid entry points. Uh we did 71 million through one paid funnel type. So like not to say you can't do it with just one. Now having value vortex, we can just see that people enter this funnel and then later they enter this funnel and they come through. And because those funnels are built in a way that's conversion focused, that's why they have like so much throughput versus like if you just had one funnel and then a bunch of content, you're just hoping that the content brings them back to do it versus when you're paying and having multiple funnels on the front. They're all kind of conversion focused. You squeeze it more is the general idea. Is there any reason why you don't partner with personalized supplements company, ecom brands, or have another product in the health and wellness niche or build your own? Maybe you do, just haven't heard you mention it. Yeah, that's in progress. Uh, we had a partnership last year where I was not paying attention when someone on the team made the partnership. It sounded rosy. I just didn't do the math on it and we got railed. We lost like literally cash over a million dollars in the partnership um because we were basically paying for XYZ for clients that were coming in to be basically enrolled in this other like partnership company and then they were going to sell them supplements and this and this and this and then we were going to get MR and like this big commission stack and all this stuff and the funnel was just broken. The funnel was just absolutely broken. So like simple math is we were paying like call it 250 bucks for someone to enroll in this. So that was directly out of the margin because we weren't charging more for it. So it was like right off the rip we were paying out of pocket and then like the conversion rate of that funnel of like how many people then sent the thing back and then how many people then got on the first call and then of the first call uh how many people went to the second closer call and then of the second closer call how many people actually bought and then once they bought we got you know 50% commission and like you do the math down and there was no way we were going to make the money back. I just like never looked at the math like I'm an idiot. Like never looked at the math correctly. Uh, and I also didn't have the numbers because they couldn't produce the numbers for me. So, like good business over there, but like not good for the amount of volume that we were pushing to them and the conversion rate rates and like mechanism they were using. Um, so yeah, now we're just going to do it in house. Uh, we care about brand a lot. We care about quality a lot. So, it is taking us a little bit longer and again, like I said, we're a little bit more corporate in this. Um, but this will be soon. Um, and I also didn't want to lose focus on the info coaching piece because it's like as soon as you layer this on, it's like, yeah, it's more LTV or it's more of this or that, but I'm like, okay, how do we build this so it has equity value? How do we roll it out the correct way? And then how do we not lose focus on the main thing, which is the entry points of the info coaching to then also have this. So, I just didn't want to I didn't want to confuse everyone. So, we kept saying we're like, oh, at 5 million a month, at 5 million a month, we'll do it. Um, but we are moving on it now. Now that we have team that's fully running specific things that we can kind of like isolate it over in its own section without it like affecting the rest of the team. So if you had a goal to make 100k in profit by end of year when is it July 20th? How would you go uh with the option of creating your own YouTube channel around trading niche provided you have good knowledge and running and running? How would you go with the option of creating and running traffic to a broker offer or starting a growth operating agency? Um, these guys crush people who are like actually good. Ahmed talks about this. He picks out Black Swans. Um but basically they have organic YouTube channels and they run them not to traffic broker offer but to their own communities. So they have MR and then they also have ascension through like education. Um trading offers are basically flipped which I think is super cool. A lot of the time people sell um do-it-yourself done with you and then done for you. And that's like the offer stack and also the pricing stack. So like you pay a,000 bucks, you pay 10 grand, you pay like 50 grand for the person to teach you, right? um or the person to do it for you, I'm sorry, or for it to be done for you. Trading is the other way around. Trading is like you pay a low ticket amount to basically get signals and join the community and get all the stuff done for you and then the the education and the access is then the other way around. So like the top tier is learning how to do it on your own versus normal models of the other way which I find very interesting. Um but yeah, they use YouTube organic, they build up this big audience on organic on multiple channels. um they provide a ton of value and then people just convert into the low ticket and then low ticket has uh or recurring low ticket and then the recurring low ticket then has different monetization plays like you said your traffic to broker offer I assume is like another monetization model so you can give like affiliates to different trading programs and stuff like that um and then starting your own growth operating agency I don't know how that works really I mean like I I don't know how you do that at at scale without the skills um but yeah you can make 100k if you crank it with one client as a growth operator agency thing. I mean, you just need to be have a partner to do that. You don't need 12 to make 100K. You need one. So, that one's probably, but that's less of uh I don't know actually. I mean, I don't know. I don't have direct I mean, I guess I do have direct experience doing it, but I've never done it in an agency capacity. So, uh if you can lean in, get a good deal, have a business model that's actually scalable with a good product, a good partner, a good expert, and all that, then yeah, it does make sense. um but you own the business on this other side that you likely don't in the growth operating. So when you have like a YouTube channel around trading for example like you would own that if you were the person or maybe these are two and the same where you're doing both. But uh business model choice uh info coaching great margins if you do it with organic and you do it with a high LTV game um a full-on business can hit exit velocity can get large. Um, I like that. If you're like a beginner and you don't have anything that you can info coach, then you need to partner with somebody about it because it's the worst thing in the world when someone sells [ __ ] they don't understand or are trying to just they sell how to make money to make money. It's like the most bogus [ __ ] ever. Um, so yeah, either doing this growth agency one or service based. So just sell service, learn a skill, get paid to learn a skill on a job somewhere and then offer as a service. Do not teach how to do it because you still don't know how to do it. Um, so I do that. send follow-ups forever or stop at a certain point. Buy or die. Um, just kidding. But yeah, no, we send follow-ups forever. So, we send two emails a day in contextual flow. So, if someone comes in on this place then and doesn't get to the next action, then it's, you know, you opted but you didn't apply tons of emails that are contextual and then we're sending two a day every day uh around content and around different messaging pockets and and all that kind of stuff. Uh, and then now also layering in like I talked about the value vortex, different consumption methods versus just always sending them to like a video or an audio. Uh, we'll send them to low ticket, we'll send them to like a free training around this messaging pocket or this. Um, so yeah, as long as you're mixing it up and then providing value more so than just constantly trying to hit them with sales. Um, yeah, you can send a lot of emails so forever. Uh, I run a software that does 50,000 in MR. Nice. And just added a high ticket version so I can run ads. I've taken 25 sales calls, 80. Okay, great stats. 80% show up and 40% close. When to hire a closer, and how to onboard them because I'm a marketer person, introvert, not a sales guy. Right now, hire them right now and hire two of them so you can see who's actually good. Um, you just need to make sure you have the flow for them or that they're hybrid and that they're and that they're hitting the, you know, low ticket current MR people and trying to ascend them into high ticket. Uh, or whatever this offer is that you're selling that then Trojan I don't have enough context, but if you're like Trojan horse selling an info offer or whatever that then people use the software like you can scale that into it. It's just its whole own uh, you know, funnel and whole own marketing channel. So, you just need to make sure you focus on it and that there's enough volume for two people. Um, but yeah, I mean, you're booking out 48 hours. Uh, a rep can take, you know, eight calls a day. You have 20 calls a day or whatever. That's two reps call it roughly. I mean, just depends. But yeah, get out of it if you're the marketing person, the introvert, and have two people who do it and have them commission only 10% and just rip it. And then again, have them do both. Have them be full stack because if you have 50k in MR, you likely have people they can right now hit up and then ascend. Uh, how do you stay inspired after reaching goals and milestones of feeling lost and empty after achieving a lot of goals? Um, I don't know the answer to that. Um, mine has changed again for the goal is progression and right now is the time and in the future it'll still be right now. And um, yeah, I mean set bigger goals. Do it for different reasons. What is the actual why in in which you're doing it? I'm not the best person to really talk about this with. I get like fulfillment through being busy at some level which is not necessarily the best thing but um I do achieve those goals and milestones throughout that and I get it out of the progression the growth the number on a screen the like doing all that kind of stuff um because it's fun to me and we learn new things and we launch new things and we hit new goals within there and CPA needs to get at this point what are the levers we need to pull and like what is the problem we need to solve in the end is really what it is is like what's the problem or what's the thing like we can solve there's like solving [ __ ] like that. Um, so I focus on that and then yeah, of course they then have results that come out of there or cash that pops out of there that are maybe milestones or tangible things. Um, I made a post on X about this the other day, but talking about like the, you know, like I live in my space, for example. I'm I'm 95% of the time like I don't leave. So like it's important to me to have a really nice space. So like why wouldn't I set that as a goal to have like the perfect thing that I exactly desire and want and like what I enjoy out of it or a space that can hold x amount of people is like a thing Robbie talked about because one of his goals is to have you know um four or five like couples always and family and this kind of stuff. So, he needs a big space and like you can't do that without achieving these certain things and having the cash to do it or having the XYZ. Um, and yeah, just like thinking bigger in that way. Um, because anybody can live and is okay with a really, you know, a cool nice one-bedroom apartment, a nice car and, you know, 20,000 in cash flow beyond that. Let's just say like, you know, that's fine. You're living fine, but like or you're good. But if everything went to zero tomorrow, like, do you have enough cash that you'd be fine forever? Unlikely. um is like there's just a lot of that. Can you provide to the things around you? Do you have XYZ in spiritual or philanthropic or whatever? Uh like stuff like that. Like that is where it starts to stretch. Again, I'm probably not the best person to answer this because I don't want to say that I feel lost and empty by any means, but like you know, we just hit record months and like I feel nothing. Um because I have like a mental number and goal and things that are like, okay, cool. Once we're at that, like it'll feel more real, but I already know like once it's that it's like then this next one, this next one. So it's more for me about like what's the actual lifestyle um what is the internal self-t talk around these things how do you become you know undeniable in XYZ way like I have certain things that are important to me and that I think are important to what then influences the people around me or what I can provide then for the people around me as well um that sure come back to these goals and milestones but yeah hopefully that's helpful that's what I got guys uh I don't have a daily update for you I don't do these every day anymore so Rolodex has some things if you're interested. There's like softwares and tech vendors and sales agency vendors and stuff like that that I use. Um so that um I have all the videos here. All the videos are on this right here. So Ryan Clark, make sure you do the www um and get to the dock. And yeah, that's what I got. So appreciate you guys. Uh today's the 20th. We are on pace for record month. Um but we will see. We did a big renewal special. So the big goal here is to make sure that all of it is new acquisition, not just current. Current's amazing and renewals are amazing because they're extremely high margin and it's great. Um, but we also want the front engine of the business producing much larger numbers than it is and we have a lot to work on to do so. So I am in the trenches. We're working and appreciate you guys and we'll talk soon. 45 minutes. Comment 45 if you made it to the end. Bye guys.

# Full Sales Operations Masterclass in 107 Minutes
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUV1votsuwc

What's up, guys? We are back. Familiar studio setup, I assume. And today we've got Josh Troy or do you like Joshua? Josh Troy is better. Josh Troy is better. I don't really care, but double first names. Yeah, I like it. My dad's last name or my dad's first name is Troy. Oh, wow. Yeah, it rings a bell. All right, we've got sales agency sicko. He is somebody that kind of changed my frame on this actually a lot because and we'll get into that into this but I always say most scalable and most systemoriented sales agency guy that I know right so Josh kick it off of who you would say you guys are wires from strangers the badass name too so thank you first of all I think it's hilarious that you say sickos we're just like so obsessed with what we do that it's sick right bunch of sickos just sickos. Um, yeah, you know, uh, our company's Wires from Strangers. Um, a lot of the times we just go by WFS Group. Uh, it's easier to say. And we're we're an outsourced sales agency. So, we just specialize in the education space. We sell info products. Co, you know, coaching businesses are our clients. And uh I think the big thing that we'll probably get into here today and we just spoke about it a second ago. I am one of the only if not the only the only is probably too assumptive but I am one of the only people that that I'm aware of one of the only sales people that doesn't really talk that much about sales. And what I mean by that is I I'm all about sales operations. And I think that's the big thing. You know, a lot of these sales guys, sales agencies, whoever it is, most of the sales content that's out there, it's just like sales training content. You're talking about what's happening on the phone, overcoming objections, whatever it is. And the the big differentiator for us is it's outsourced sales operations, not to be confused with outsource sales. And the point is like it's a full approach to scaling, right? It's the systems, the processes, it's everything that you actually need to scale. And so, you know, I believe that all the money is made in the process, the systems, and the spreadsheets. And so, it's all the I love my spreadsheets. It's my love language. I'm a freak in the sheets. I'm a sicko in the sheets, I'll say now. Um, but yeah, that's that's the big difference. That's all we do. And I think that um I I like to approach things from a very tactical, strategic level. So, we directly met. So, for everyone, so they're clear, we directly met at Onyx event in Was that Dallas, Texas? Yeah, Dallas. Uh, yeah. Yeah. And he's sitting there next to me and he's got his laptop open and I'm just kind of like cruising around the room doing my thing as I do because I can't sit still. And he's over there and he's got like these Slack notification things that are happening. And then he's like clicking on this sheet that auto pulls from here with this like deal ID and it's going into here. And I had no idea what he did. I thought it was like his own info product. And come to find out it's one of many offers. But he has all of these automations and these data specifics and he's got these like breakdown CRM specific teams and all this stuff which is like my love language, right? Like that is what I do. Like when I talk to, you know, Jeremy again, the scene here, we're we're ripping today. It's 10:15 p.m. by the way, and we're going to go for a ripper. Um, but like I understand the structure, the math, the system. So when you say that around sales, the my experience around that was with Cole Gordon, right? Like hearing how he kind of did his piece of it. Like that was my really only piece of that that I learned. And then beyond that, it was like marketing, overall business, that structure. And then when I started talking to you, I was like, "Oh, there are." And like you kind of opened my mind to this of like there are other people out there who think of think in this way but in your world. So I want to like I got n I've got 92 questions. But if I knew that this was possible I have this huge belief around this and I talked about this in one of these videos in here. I talked about it. I was like you shouldn't have a sales team if you like you just shouldn't have a sales team. And my belief is an inhouse sales team. An in-house sales team. I don't think people should have an in-house sales team basically after call it 100 grand a month roughly because I think that headache comes from headcount a lot of the time for a lot of these people most people who are running info coaching are doing cash flow businesses right that is like out of the box majority of people if they want to go in-house they're building this equity value they're doing the thing it's W2 it's like a full suite different story that's what we're doing but back in the day we had a sales team and we were a cash flow business and it was the biggest headache the churn the the the management that everyone has an emotional week and you make no money because it's the only way you make money. The structure, the scaling of it was just it the headcount got bigger there than every other department combined because it's just that's the it's part of the puzzle, right? It's like when your calendar has to get bigger, it has to happen. So, we tried to do 1099 sales management. Mhm. Two or three times. Two and then the third led to having an in-house manager cuz the sales management company was literally like you need someone in house like you we can't do this. But we never had something that was your approach. So explain how you guys do it because if we would have had this, if I knew this was a thing or if someone offered this to me at the time, I would have literally signed it in two seconds and we would I don't even know where we'd be today because now we've changed and it's a whole different model and we're trying to run things for this in-house and we have like W2 sweet things and like this whole structure then I would have and I think most people should. So what is how explain how you guys go about service delivery? I'm doing 150 grand a month. I sell a 7K annual program and I have three or four reps in house and we're like getting by, but I'm like I kind of hate this wholesale team part. Yeah. Well, first of all, if you have three or four closers are only at 150, things are not going well. Real from an average revenue per rep perspective. Um, but listen, I'm very transparent on this. Say it again. So, they're part time. Yeah, they're part time. Okay. Uh, I'm very I'm very transparent on this conversation. Um, that's just the style that's always worked for me. And one of the things I'll say is, you know, I have these conversations all the time. This is what I do. And people, you know, will talk about some of the risks of outsourcing. And I tell them that they are absolutely right. 100% right. I have seen so many bad examples. I'm going to tell you a story actually that I don't talk about often. And I actually didn't I forgot about this until just the other day. I was doing a podcast like this and it reminded me of it. I'll get to there in a second. But essentially what happened uh or essentially my my belief on it is that most outsource sales agencies it is very problematic. It is hard to make work and the reason why it's how they operate. Most sales agencies operate as a third party external siloed team that doesn't have that collaboration and connectivity that you need to truly perform. And that's why there's a lot of horror stories working with these outside teams. Our positioning statement and and the reason I'm I'm leaning in starting with this is because it speaks to how I built this entire company is where your outsourced in-house sales team. That's not a cute line that I say because it sounds good. That speaks to our whole business model. I knew to have the solution that actually made sense and to have a sustainable engagement. I'm not interested in taking somebody from 200 grand to 400 grand and then they have the bright idea to take them in house. I want to stay with them to one million a month, 2 million a month, three million a month. We have clients at all those levels and I can't do that if I don't have, you know, a solution that works long term like that. And so the way that I designed this and I and I literally have had these conversations with soon to be clients and clients and I said I once they understand completely how we do things I say you tell me what would be the difference if you did this in house and they have a really freaking hard time coming up with something that sounds good because the way we build it I'll I'll unpack this for you is there's an M&A term I love explaining this it's called integration now it's exactly how it sounds in merges and acquisitions, one company buys another. You have to integrate the two entities. And one of the number one reasons that M&As fail when they do is because poor integration. It's probably the most important word. Anyone could go buy a company and sign a contract. What happens after the contract is what matters. It's the value creation process. Did you capture and realize the actual investment thesis? And when it doesn't happen, it's because they're not able to uh you know do the integration and capitalize on the thesis, right? And the synergies. And so what happens is they they take they take over something, they start making all these changes and they're just not able to get things to run smoothly as one entity. So there's all these hiccups. I take that same concept and I apply it to every engagement. I want it to feel like one entity. Are we a third-party entity on paper? Yeah, of course we are. But it should never feel that way. And so a couple ways that shows up is first of all, none of our reps cross-ell. One thing that agencies will do is they'll have them sell across multiple offers. I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. We don't crossell. So our reps when we like if we're doing your sales as an example or or any anyone the the the reps that we hire for that account, they only sell on that account. And the communication that we have with the brand and the client and they can be in those Slack channels and they could jump on calls with the team. it feels like their own sales team because they don't sell on anything else. Now, there's actually even more deeper reasons that's important. By the way, we're not going to make this whole podcast about outsource sales, right? But, but a lot of the stuff I'm going to say, even if they want to do it in house, they're going to want to do it this way. And and and we already said at the beginning, like I want this episode to be, in fact, it's my personal mission. I want to make this freaking podcast of yours the most tactical you've done because we're sickos, right? You said it yourself. We're sickos. We're gonna get deep. But listen to this. So the other thing about not cross-selling is I believe a huge a huge mistake that people make wrong with sales teams is they think that all sales reps are created equal. So they hire a rep because they say, "Oh, it's a great salesperson. They have a track record. They sold XYZ." But we treat talent acquisition like customer acquisition. when you build an ICP and ideal can uh client profile we build an ICP ideal candidate profile on on the talent side on the recruiting side and it's just like ideal client profile we have to figure out like well who's compatible with this offer what's the audience what do they look like what demographic sells better what selling style is their experience transferable because not all coaching products are are the same to sell so we look for all those things and when they specialize it could sell a lot better so that's one example the transparency in the data and the dashboards we build. That's a second example. The fact that we build everything and our playbooks and our systems on their tech stack, that's a third example. We don't hold anybody hostage. And so when you go through all of these things, we try to build it in every single way like it is your own team, but you get all the expertise and the proven playbooks and, you know, all of the systems that we bring to the table. And and that right there, I will confidently tell you that is why we have the results that we have and that's why we've been able to create experiences for people that have had nightmare experiences with other agencies. Yeah. And so explain the let's get into the model because I I'm so curious on what your and I don't know how much you want to share not of like your actual structure and how you do it because that's just a talent generation machine. It is a talent experience slash like quality machine like you have. So it's you're in the people business. You can put as many systems on it as you want or run on it as many systems as you want. But like you it's people on the front, it's people in the middle, it's people in the back. It's all people, right? That you are it's all people. In fact, I often say we're a recruiting first business. Yeah, you have to be. We from from day one from day so so my partner and I are he's our chief sales officer. We have uh been in sales for a long time and him way longer. He's been in sales for 30 years. High ticket sales for 30 years. He was an executive uh for Time Shares, you know, in the beginning of his career. The OG high ticket OG dude bribe someone to be there. They want nothing to do with what you're selling. They want their free gift and in 90 minutes you sell them a $30 to $50,000 package and they like you for it. Yeah, that's high ticket, you know. And then, you know, he did speaking and get whatever. The point was we had a warm pool of candidates. Like we we we had a lot of sales reps. We knew a lot of sales reps. But from day one, I said, "I will not start this company without building an absolute like prolific recruiting engine because at one point, no matter how many relationships we have, we will need more. Like we will blow past that." And so from day one, I built a recruiting engine. If we can't recruit or sorry, if we can't attract and retain top talent, we don't have a business model. So, we have to put the rep first and everything. I say no to deals sometimes that I actually know I can make money on, but there won't be enough money for earning potential for the reps and I have to say no because I know it's going to affect my ability to retain the type right talent we want. Do you do you dock like pricing and stuff and talk numbers? We don't have to. We don't have to. You mean like our engagements? Yeah, we can. I I'm I'm transparent about it. Okay. Because I talk about the model because I talk about cost models and structure and whatever like all the time. I'll be like, "Okay, so we're going to this percentage is fulfillment, this percentage is sales, right?" And it breaks down. So like us with W2, right? You take it and you add 20% right off a rip or whatever. You can do your math. It's a little different. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes lower. But like the out of the box closer, if you're just to throw it on paper, 10%. Okay, let's say. I know people who do six, seven, eights. I know people who do 12, 14s, whatever. It's different cash collection. It's different contract value versus there's bonus pools. There's all this [ __ ] right? There's that. There's a setter layon. And then when you get to volume, there's a closer manager, there's a setter manager, and a lot of time there's a sales ops coordinator, right? And then expanded upon. That's my like simple view of it. And that can stack up and internally when you run that can be 15 to 17 points, whatever when you're like humming and can very easily when you stack W2 and some fat and some comp models over top of each other quickly get to 20 22 whatever up upwards of 25 oning accident. There's me my bleeping again. But like that can happen. So your model is we charge 20% of collected revenue. If I was offered this when we were in the position we were in we were doing we were doing a million a month selling info hybrid of coaching like two different offers they could pitch same funnel and we needed it desperately and we ended up getting uh a pod leader was the number one pod leader in a very large info coaching business that does like 12 or 15 or whatever a month right now. It was the largest pod leader to my understanding. Came over, highest month they had done in their pod was like three million. Next thing you know, ramps up. We're doing this whole thing. First time we have like a true internal sales manager that wasn't basically us or doing it. We get up to 3 million. That's the chart on somewhere on there where you see that like uptick that was in that range. So everything was firing. Marketing was firing. Talent acquisition was like boom. Like everything was firing. Selling a high ticket product. Like all of the things made sense to why that rev looked like that but not the profit of that. Okay. Profit was okay but was not [ __ ] good. So if we had that opportunity 20% out of the box, how does your model then work? Like what does a good sales rep make? What does a good manager make? Yeah. How do you acquire consistent amount of insane talent? And like how do you break that out? So I I'll break down a few things when it comes to the economics. So let's start at a very basic level. Now we and I'm very grateful for this. Like we get large relationships. In fact, I just started working with somebody that you introduced me to and uh they were already at a million a month. So, that's not uncommon for us. Big dog. Yeah. It's not uncommon for us. Like we we get large relationships and and and the reason why is because the sophistication of our systems and our approach. Yeah. And that's it's not a sales pitch. Like I show them what I know and they realize, oh wow, there's a lot more to this. And that's how we earn their trust. And so because of our ability to do that consistently, our our average accounts are are already doing um a good amount of revenue. It's usually people that hit a plateau and they're stuck or people that have massive am momentum and they they need a higher level of expertise. They've kind of like outgrown their own skill sets and those are our favorite deals. Like we don't like to just take deals that are on fire. We want ones that have momentum and need firepower. ICP out of a box is so out of the box. For the longest time, I used to say if they're not doing 200,000 a month yet, then then we don't want the engagement. Now, it's not a hard line in the sand. And I won't forget about going back to the economics that you just asked me, but I want to explain that. Well, it's a it's actually a good segue because I want to break down the economics at that level, at that like $200,000 a month level. Yeah. But when someone has 200k a month business, what is their current because this is also something I don't understand about your model necessarily is like pick your math. That's two reps. That's already like they already have something to be doing 200k a month. Exactly. So like Well, that's the key. So let me I'll finish this. We'll go to the economics again. It's not a magic line in the sand. Why do we want $200,000? Now I'm not saying this in an ignorant or insensitive way. I'm saying it from a factual way, in a relative way. When you compare business models across industries, in this industry, comparatively to other industries, $200,000 a month is really easy. I say it comparatively, very easy. Like, there are companies that launch an info product and they're doing 200,000 a month the first month. I I met somebody last night that did 500 grand the first month they launched because the pent-up demand they had. So, it's very easy. So, why does that matter to us? Because my two favorite words in business, I say them all the freaking time. Validation and speed. I have to validate as many variables as I can and then scale those things once they're validated as fast as I can. That's the speed. And so at 200 grand a month, there's a lot of validation that happens. You show me that you have proven lead flow, uh, predictable lead flow, a customer acquisition model that's working. You've, uh, validated product market fit. Now, we could look at comps and things like that, but we see that you have a proven offer that people are responding to. You have the basics of fulfillment figured out because you're already, you know, fulfilling and, you know, I don't want to sell anything I don't believe in, so fulfillment is really important to us. And then, um, and then the economics are working within reason. And so, and like you said, it's usually a couple reps. So, that's why we look for that. Now, there are times where it makes sense at a little bit lower of a level. If it's under 100 grand, they need to get a little further. If they're at a 100 grand, I want to have the conversation because sometimes I could just give them a couple tips, they get to 200, and now we start working with them. Um, but that's the level, right, that that we look for just because we can take a lot of larger deals. So, we don't want to mess with the small ones because again, we have a performance-based model. We eat what we kill. We're confident in what we do. But I can't drag the reps through the mud if they haven't figured out these things that we don't do. I'm not afraid of problems, but they need to be problems that I solve. You know, if I have a call with somebody who's like, I'm at 50 grand a month and I can't figure out lead flow for my life. I'm sorry for that. We don't do lead flow. We're sales, right? So, anyways, that's the point. Now, to get back to the question, so if they're at 200,000 a month, think about the math for a second. You said it yourself, 10% to closers. How much to setters? Just pick a number. Three to five. Three to five. So, call it 15. Now, what do you think a good closer should make? Just a good one. Not an amazing one. Nothing crazy. A good one. Just a good one. 150 200 grand. Okay. That breaks down to 10 to 15 grand a month, right? Yeah. Do you think a manager should make less than them? The same more. This is such a highly This is the [ __ ] people want to hear. By the way, this All right. So, I am of the belief in our organiz like our style, how I want it run is like I don't want to think about it. And the same reason I keep saying it about this like so I guess I would lean in the way of like overpay but I know I would say I've heard market comps and all that kind of stuff lands in a two to 500 like when crushing 500 for a sales manager is extremely high. Yes. But you're making my point easier for me. I am. Let's just say I am. I gave you the math. I know. Yeah. But but here's here's the point. So 200 grand a month. I told you I charge 20%. You pay 10% right out the gate to closers. You're paying 3 to 5% for setters. Usually, everyone I speak to is paying four to 5%. You're at 15. You can't have a good sales manager that's going to make less than 10 grand a month. You said way higher than that. Yeah, way higher than that. Okay. Well, let's just say it's 10 grand a month. What's 10 grand? What percentage of 200 is is 10 grand? What percentage of 200? It's 5% grand. Yeah. 20. I know. I gave you my math off the rip. And then here's the important part manager and then this is the biggest mistake that I see when I go into businesses people think that sales manager means everything sales like so they expect their sales man CRM configuration tech stack reporting data recruiting training call reviews it's like one dude you just named like seven roles in our business and that's what they try to do so you're at 20% % and not even doing the actual job sets that you have to do to properly run a business. So now when you work with us, a lot of those parts can be fractionalized, but you can't hire an eighth of a a trainer. I mean, you could outsource training and stuff, but then again, it just adds to the cost basis anyway. So you get to the same place, right? So this is what we do and we bring all of our, you know, our playbooks in. You you fractionalize our whole structure. We have our whole recruiting department. it until they get to a lot of hundred thousands of dollars a month, we're actually cheaper. Yeah, that's the funny thing. And and most of the time they don't know their sales allocation numbers. So they're like, "Oh, I'm doing it less than that." And I have to so often I have to tell them, Ryan, no, you're not. Yeah. And then I have to break down the math that I just explained because for some reason they didn't do it yet. And then even when you get into pretty significant scale, call it between 500 a million at once you once you start getting over seven figures a month, can you shave a little bit of margin? You can you can save a little bit, but now you're assuming that you are performing at the same if not better than we are cuz percentage margin is one thing, net margins another, or net profit's another. Are you able to do the same things that we do when this is all we do all day every day? Yeah. and the opportunity cost and the and the churn and the headcount growth across that and the emotional weeks and the buckets that are in bad thing and the cultural all of a sudden mismatch and you lose half a team and the like dude I could go all day I should have come on this and been like sell me on why because this doesn't make sense but I instead am just like your hype man right now because it's soing real thought about this so many times I literally I'm telling you I have a dedicated video where I'm like this is like a thing so I could go like 40 directions with this but so the math is the math Yes. Now you fractionalize which portions of this because you have dedicated reps which again obviously I understand and I agree is the most important part because it's the person that's the closest connection. It's the person that's over here but management wise you do have fractionalized. Correct. Yeah. So the way what part of the stack is fractional versus dedicated of like your whole of like you know you have setters you have a sales ops you have closers you have management. Any rep position is dedicated? Setters dedicated closers dedicated. any type of sales rep dedicated. When you get into management, it's fractionalized until a certain point in revenue because if they're doing enough revenue, they have to be dedicated or they have to have two or three based on the level of revenue. So, multiple clients of ours do have dedicated management as well. When they're lower revenue, it's not needed yet because a capac it all comes down to capacity and we run tight capacity models. Now, I'll tell you two things. I from what I've heard and I don't know everybody's business model in the world but of the sales agencies I know of we have the best management to account ratio the amount of low very low interesting very low one to three is usually where we're at and and usually it's two that matters a lot because we run capacity well but it also matters how we're able to do that because we have a very talent leveraged or chart part meaning that I take I look at all the capacity models and I break down every single job set that somebody has because I'm very systemsoriented. We have value engines and we have all of our process documentation and I have time tracking to see how much time they spend on every single task and then I take away and specialize anything that doesn't put them in their most leveraged state that doesn't impact revenue which I could delegate to other teams. So, an example of this is uh our our CRM integration team. We have a full team of sales integrators. They're like sales coordinators that are following playbooks and SOPs on pipeline management and leveling those insights up to the sales manager. The sales manager is managing it with the team, but they don't have to spend the entire week in the trenches doing those things. So, I'm optimizing capacity, staying the most leveraged self to give the most high quality service, which keeps our ratios what they are. Now, this is insane. And and I would actually be fair to other sales agencies and say um that this is probably an outlier and an extreme, but I had somebody from a competitor literally tell me he was applying to me. He was applying for us and he told me himself that he was managing 20 accounts. And I didn't say it, but I thought it. That is what gives sales agencies a bad name. Dude, you can't do that. Yeah, there it's not. Yeah, you're not doing what you need to do if you do that. What do you think a good sales back on? I'm just thinking my mind right now is like economics and math and like models because you're like 20 across these and if they're making this and like in their brain it's probably like they're stacking this or even the person's like, "Oh, they can handle it." And their comp explodes into this. What is a good each one of those layers? Let's go setter. And not to say a setter then closer. I'm not saying it necessarily as hierarchy like that, but like we're just going to say a setter, a closer, a sales ops, which you do a funny integration thing there. You have kind of like a different model I think than that because you kind of go a little wider and do the VA thing I think, right? Versus a dedicated and then a sales manager. Like what are good comps or great comps? What are great compensations? You mean comp plans, not competitors? Comp plans. Comp plans. So OT for these positions. uh five to eight for setters. You have to be above 10 grand for good reps, for good sales reps, for good closers. Really, I believe that top talent opens up at 15K a month. The way that we build our comp plans is that you should be you should be around that range for a pretty good B player. So, that means the A players are going to soar quite a bit past that, right? Um, we we do have reps that make in the threes. It has a three in it, meaning 30s. We have reps that are in that, right? So, above 15 for top talent and closer. Now, some people are like, "Wow, that's crazy." Dude, the market is what it is. And sometimes all the answers on the other side of acceptance. You know how many freaking people I've hired and you know how many talented people we've managed and evaluated? If I could hire the best closers for 10 grand, I would. But that's the market. And what people have to understand in a skill set, you're competing crossindustry. I'm not just competing with this other whatever uh info product. There's SAS jobs out there that are paying $150,000 bases, right? It happens. Now, that's what from SAS is kind of lowering now with where the market's at. Maybe it's not as high as a base, but when you have these things, you have to be a a great and especially in a performance business, you have to have good earning potential there. And then there's other things that you know closers like about the education space. Um sales management 15 to 30. um I in 15 when I say 15 to in this instance I'm talking about ramping meaning like not you're you don't want them to sit there long term but I'm saying like when they start building up you can find really good talent entering in around there um up up to 30 um in in and that position can go higher and it does go higher but here's the thing about sales management which is why comp and OT is very tricky their raise becomes effective as they do it. Dude, it's all it's all capacity. And we have our different KPIs and our different metrics to analyze efficiency, their own activity KPI, so how effective they are with their workload and their team KPIs, the better they are at ramping reps, stabilizing reps, and staying within KPI, the more effortless their job becomes. the more reps they take on, the more earning potential there goes up. So you could have a really good sales manager 30, 40, 50, it can keep adding and that comes with time because they have to build, you know, the team and be leveraged. Um, was there another one that you said? Sales ops. Um, can you be more specific? That's like a category. Yeah. Yeah. So like, so for example, we have like a specific sales ops. I then talked to you. We have a VA that's been with us forever. She was the one who saved me for making it so I had to I could stop resetting passwords at 10 p.m. when I was out because we had six people or whatever and I was still or probably at that point up to 15 and I was still doing all that. And so I got a VA that ended up actually being like five people and I didn't even know but just like sweetheart VA uh from the Philippines. And just recently I was like we've done so many things in the automation front that like the workload kind of like she does all the recurring stuff that's not directly automated or like you know the this and that like which you maybe even could at this point but she is just like so ingrained and where I was like hey you already do all the sales onboarding tech you do all these pieces introed her over to our sales apps coordinator which we have as one specific person who is also sweetheart angel like people person and she now works directly with her for all of like CRM audits and tracker audits and all there. So, it's kind of like a two stack, which right department, but like we have a lead who is that person. We don't have like a couple VAS in the manager. We have like a literal full-on person. Yeah. Which I've also heard is common, right? Like I've heard of other a lot of people like we have we were interviewing for sales managers. We just had a new sales management shift. And uh I mean we have a to be fair, we have a whole operations department. You know, we have a director of sales operations. So, it it goes deep. It just depends what we're looking at. Yeah. Okay. Because I'm like, you know, I hear people who just do it all VAS. I hear people who do it who it's a 50 60k a year. I hear people who have like this Here's how I'll answer this question for you and this is a really good piece of advice here. I think it's like I actually think it's a strategy of mine that I've used for a long time that's very valuable. The way and I I taught myself to do this because it just seemed intuitive. Every business is a little bit different and it's kind of nuance especially like I don't I like to see comps. I like to know other org charts and what's common in the industry as a reference point to get some ideas and to get brainstorming but I don't like to follow status quo because I I most of the time I believe like I can find a more optimal way to do it and that gives us the competitive advantage. Why would I want to copy what everybody else is doing? Now I by definition don't have a competitive advantage. So I've always built org charts and uh positions in a very unique way and what what I do everything is documented again in in in process maps process maps and then I it just like an operating system right I you have process and I've I've gone through so many different programs throughout my career and mentors and people you know different operating systems things like this and you know I have all my process maps I break that down into every individual stage of the process and then I pair that with people and then I try to identify okay now this person's over capacity this is the job set and the skills that they need this is what I this is the position I need and here's what I do regardless of what that person's going to be for you regardless of what the title is I take the job skill sets that the person I need to hire would have and I go find any other position in the marketplace that has those skill sets And that's how I understand the market comp. And so what let me let me make that land a little bit more clear to I want to make sure this point lands. So I hired uh we have a leadflow manager because we have one simple equation. Lead flow time sales performance equals revenue. But Josh, you're sales not marketing. Yeah, we are, but we can't afford to ignore half the equation. And so we have somebody that at all times is looking at lead velocity and call volume to make sure we have the proper inputs to hit our proper outputs and forecasts and they do a lot of stuff. But when I hired that position, I hired for like I think it was like uh life life cycle marketing manager. You see the point? Yeah. And so the point is I found someone exactly what we needed. But dude, if I if I posted with leadflow manager, the quality of candidate would have been way lower. I would have been guessing it would have been this weird hodgepodge. So to to whatever it is, whatever position it is, I just I come to the processes we need them to own. I I figure out the the skill sets that that person needs to have. Use chat GPT to see what other positions already exist that have those skill sets and then look at what the talent pool in the market will tell you they need to be paid. Yeah, I was going to ask you that because you hear so many of these guys that are like, "Oh, I'm a growth operator for info or whatever." And it's like they touch a toz at some point or like, "Oh, I just do sales and then eventually they're in marketing." Or, "Oh, like you know, Jeremy even talks. He's like, "Yeah, we do marketing." And then it's some level it's like we either do it as much as we can in marketing and backend sales systems so they can just be cashiers. But like the whole equation eventually you want to help because it like makes you more money. It makes the the whole account, right, grow. Uh, and it's the thing I just thought of on there was like when you said the two-step equation. Uh, I do you know Josh Snow? Yes. Yeah. So Josh and uh I think and Anthony, they had a lead genen big company and I've heard him give a talk and I might be like this complete paraphrase but they had this big lead genen company and I don't know directly what lead flow they were selling but it was like debt or student loans or credit cards or something, right? And they were like crushing that. They had I heard him talk about this one time. They had a dedicated person that would fly out to like the buyers to the call centers and train them because they had all of his lead flow, but they needed the conversion, the phone portion. So, they was like the exact flip of it, right? It was like dominating marketing flow. Interesting. And they were like, we need to like we want these clients to make more money per call that comes in and in order to do that, then we make more money or then they can grow their call center larger, which means we can send more calls. So they had this like equation where eventually they were like we're going to go outside of our bucket of what our thing is to like continue growth over there. Yeah. And I early on when I heard that and I was like that is interesting. I have a very interesting balance on this equation though. I like where this conversation's headed. I already know that we're going to get into some deep stuff right now because I again I talked about the beginning about sales operations. Um and we're going to give some really powerful sales nuggets on like what's working right now in high ticket sales and different efficiency models and things like that. But the big thing for me is a lot of sales agencies are run by sales guys. I'm an operator, man. There's a difference. Now, sales has always been a skill set of mine. That's why I started this company because I love sales more than anything else. But I am a an actual operator, right? Systems, process, scalable infrastructures. That's what I do. And so when we're talking about this stuff, there's two really important forces that kind of come together and they have to create this balance. The first force is extreme ownership, which is what you're talking about. Meaning, dude, the amount of time we spend on lead flow type activities. I literally have positions for it, and we don't do we work with full-on marketing agencies. Well, why do we do that? Because, like I said, all the answers on the other side of acceptance. I sat there for months and months and months complaining that other people weren't getting it done. But then I calculated how much money it cost me, and I said, "Well, I don't care. for hiring it anyways. But the here's the second force. So that's the first force extreme ownership and just understanding basic opportunity costs in your business and what type of action can can fix that for you. Right? If I have a multiple six figure problem and I can solve that with a couple uh $10,000 hires or whatever it is, I'm going to do that now. And I'll look at the labor efficiency ratios to make sure I have an ROI on the talent that I hire. Now, on the other side though, I'm really big on not going out of our lane. Um, I'm really big on that. So, it's a balance. And here's why. Some of my best employees I've ever had, I've owned businesses for over a decade now. Some of my best employees I've ever had, I've had to had have the most disciplinary conversations with the most frequent. And the reason why it's always one topic, they're such a high output individual that they start to do everybody else's job. And now they take away from what I need them focused on that ruins their efficiency and they make everybody else weaker and lazier because other people are like, "Oh, we could lean on this person, send it to that person, ask this person, do less." And they actually hurt efficiency in other areas. It's happened so many. I've had to had I'll be like, "Listen, you're one of my best employees and I'm going to have to fire you." I've had these talks, dude, because they don't understand. They're disrupting the business and they they mean good. They mean well. They have good intentions, but it's actually damaging the business- because of that, right? So, those two sets of logic is why I'm so careful on that balance because anytime we start going out of our lane, you know what happens? It's a lose-lose situation. Here's why. If we start doing something that isn't actually what we're paid to do, one of two things happens. There's only two scenarios. We do a good job or we do a bad job. If we do a bad job, now we have consequences for something we don't even get paid for if we do a good job. Now, they want us to keep doing it and we don't get paid for it. So, there's no point. So you have to identify is this leveraged enough where it makes a big enough difference where we're going to allocate resources or do we draw draw our foot you know a line in the sand and make sure that ex we communicate properly to external partners. Yeah. And like the person that you're talking about earlier that I made the referral over like that's a perfect case point because in my head I'm like okay cool if you have the right you already have the right ICP but like you know if they fit in that box well enough it is a like 1 plus one equals 55 scenario like those guys are marketers. Yeah, those guys are market both the two different people I'm thinking of are very aggressive marketers and if they can just focus on that entire like you'd get in their way if you were over in their lead flow like of course some like hey can you guys this or feedback from sales is one thing feedback from sales is one thing and is a lot different than needing direct help in marketing like these it goes back to the initial word you have to have the integration don't get in each other's way exactly like a big pet peeve of mine and dude this has nothing to do with ego it has nothing to do with control. But do not tell me what to do on a sales call as a marketing team, leader, anything. Don't [ __ ] tell me, dude. I don't want to hear it. Why? Because we have done so many thousands of calls and we have such a big track record showing that we know what we're doing that like, I don't care about your opinion on what you feel should happen if you don't have that track record. But guess what? Same thing. I will check my team so hard if they try to correct somebody on marketing because I I believe in that level of respect and trust. Yeah. If we're going to ask that trust, I will not tolerate one of our sales managers or team members trying to tell marketing what to do. Yeah. The feedback loop in collaboration, however, is critical. Yeah. Every week, you should be connecting with marketing and sales. Take out the blame game. Something that people love when I say I create a culture around you're not you're not allowed to use the word lead quality for my sales managers. You're not allowed to use it. You know why? It is so freaking subjective. It drives everybody crazy. It produces no clear actions. Oh, the lead quality is low. How how much low? How high was it? What changed to make the quality lower? How was it impacting? I don't like it. So, we have to have very specific data points on how we communicate that. But the reason the feedback loop is important is because everything you ever want to ever need to know is on the call and they're not on the calls, we're on the calls and they trust us to listen to it. So, we have to pass that down to adjust front-end messaging and positioning to improve lead quality. And you know, again, we don't say it like that, but you understand the importance of the relation. Absolutely. Yeah. Like we just had a call this week. We have new sales management in place and we have CMO that's newish but like you know months in and but it was kind of like still the initial melding of minds because a new there's a new player right in there and it was like understanding on what the current setup is and we were trying to solve for show rates which is the fun which is the classic like right there get them in the same room and in all fairness everyone's trying to learn everyone's but I was trying to like navigate the conversation that like it started to lean in this direction it was like oh well we can do this with the application or this with this And it was like whoa stop like don't like pull back. Like marketing's got this. Marketing's got this part. Like yes, there's a lot that marketing can handle. If people are booking and then instantly cancelling like there is a frame thing that does not even make its way to sales that you guys need to worry about like you know like we'll we're going to handle it over here. Like there needs to be trust over there to handle it. Then on this portion like what is the communication like the pass off and the automation? What can we do for you there? It was like a sales or it was sales marketing like a tech. We're all sitting in there and it's I always say the the the bridge from marketing to sales is Zapier. Yeah, exactly. Like that's the position you need to connect the two. I have a senior tech lead that is like a rock star and he had a it's he was like in our exact business model like niche prior had his own business stand up and like he just really liked that part of it and when he ended up shutting his kind of down he came over with like perfect fit and now there's two of them in there and then one came like perfect fit and we I call them the boys now because we have two it's just two guys and we're just like the boys. um they are building all things sales tech and in that world and all the tracking around it and it's eyes are opening as to what is lead quality when two people are in the same round robin and one has a 42% close rate and one has a 12% close rate it's like there's your lead quality and I'm like what do you mean like it's literally the same bucket like it's not like it's not a teamwide so okay I do want to zoom back though because if we're getting tactical we're getting tactical comp plans for closers yep okay there's 52 different versions of it I can tell you ours, you can tell me your like what do you think right now? What's working now? What is like industry standard? We know the rough averages. They need to make around 15. They can get upwards of 30. Yes. But like on cash collected versus contract value versus 30-day versus and I'm I'm going to try to condense I'm going to try to condense my answers in in in the amount of words I use to get more coverage in in topics. So here's the answer. I'll start with first principles. Everything starts with OT. When you build a comp plan, you have to understand the on-track earnings that you're trying to get into. What how much money should they make if they're hitting KPI? Well, you have to start with the KPIs then. And you can only plug KPIs and target metrics into a funnel. So, anytime somebody asks me like, well, what should I pay the sales sales reps? The first thing I say is like, what is your customer acquisition model? Cuz you have to plug it into there. And then you have to see what's realistic in terms of metrics to hit. What I said, real. Like, that's the thing. That's where it starts. Like I I've created a video on this somewhere on my Instagram. It was like 7 minutes long. It was this random rant I did on a Saturday cuz everybody asked me about comp plans. Like guys, where do they need to be? Map out your funnel. And then you have to see what's realistic for those metrics. Get some baseline and benchmarks. I know them because I see so many different brands. And then and then or just get a baseline of whatever information you have at that time. And what pay range does that put them in? Play with the percentages until it puts them in a range that you need to attract and retain top talent. That's the simple part. Now, let's go step two, right? That's just like how you get a basic model. Now, the deeper part about this is comp plans. The the the basics, the most fundamental building block of a good comp plan is that it incentivizes behavior. It influences what you need them to do. This is why there's actually a lot of uh really large enterprise people out there that say that like comp plans are ever evolving. I subscribe to that methodology, but it's a little bit different in a model that's so repeatable like us and it's going across a lot of different things because there's a lot of uh consistency in these models. But in other plans like SAS where they have like growth uh phases and then they have, you know, harvest phase, they have all these different business phases. they have to constantly shift it based on these moving targets and financial goals, right? So the point is you need to have things that incentivize the behavior. So what in what in what are we trying to incentivize? Well, there's only a couple things you want. Efficiency, total revenue, and collections. Like those are the main things that you're looking for. So a couple different things that are super common is like pay a couple hundred bucks extra for a PIFF, right? to focus on that. But dude, here's the thing that's interesting. Some people, they start incentivizing things that lower stuff. Why? Because now they're pushing for the revenue too freaking hard. So like if you give them a huge piff, that's going that's overcorrecting. And then the other thing I find and like this is why dude I could I could literally if you want to go till it's fre what is it Friday night? If you want to not stop and go till Sunday night, I won't run out of words because there's so much to say on these topics, right? But back to the point. So when you have a comp plan, one thing people don't actually realize is you need to give them highly specific training that relates to it. So if you're going to bonus on PIFFs and collections, you have to have really detailed training, standardized training on how you optimize for collection rate. What is your funding waterfall? Interesting, right? Yeah. People don't realize that training actually goes into the comp plan because you start incentivizing them. So they start hyperfixating on that. But if they don't have the skill sets now, they're losing deals because they're trying to slam dunk deals when maybe they could have got a payment plan or whatever it is. So you have to go uh you know there's things like this. So that's like paid in full collections route. You could you know it's usually a couple hundred bucks really low. Then you have accelerators that I've always liked. Accelerator, sliding scale, layer cake. There's different names for it on different tiers of um of of revenue and and it's all again it's all based on averages. So if if my if my baseline and pretty good is here, then they'll get an additional accelerator here, right? Uh they might even have a lower accelerator if they're below the average KPIs. So they just get a small percentage additional at these different tiers. Biggest tip I can give you right now on comp plan. The biggest thing I see even when there's a right comp plan in place is they don't have qualifiers like pairing metrics. No qualifiers meaning I'm going to explain it. If so I I actually had a real engagement I took on and I inherit some wonky comp plans like some weird I'm like how did you even think that would work? kind of want to give you ours so you can like Well, hold on. We'll do that in a second. We'll break it down and it will be fun cuz it might it might fall into the wonky category. It could. It's I my mind it's simple and like I get the math and like I probably actually would change it to make it simpler and so the math works better. But well, don't let me lose you here. This is such an important part. I'm in. All right, we're He just turned his chair. He's now he's I need more nicotine by the way. But uh All right, so check this out, dude. Qualifiers. So, I had a client that before they came over to us because I have to bring in the comp plans and fix a bunch of stuff, right? They had this massive accelerator. First of all, it's too big of a jump because they didn't build in a spreadsheet. So, they weren't even looking at the math, right? But they had this math. It's not the worst. It's the worst, dude. And they don't even know it a lot of the time. But they they had this massive accelerator for a certain level of revenue. Well, dude, so they had reps that they allowed to just take as many calls as they want, and they were taking like crazy amounts of calls a day, super long hours, working on weekends. They'd hit these accelerators. They're getting massive commissions as a percentage. And their close rate and efficiency was horrible. Yeah. Return on revenue. And so I'm like, what are you actually trying to incentivize? Just people to be sloppy as hell and work all day long cuz that's what your comp plan says. Like what if your comp plan can speak? Is it saying what you think it is to your team? Because this comp plan was telling the team, you can be as lazy and sloppy as inefficient as you want as long as you take a shitload of calls to hit that top revenue number and then their rorowaz would turn to [ __ ] So as that example, if you're going to have these accelerators at different tiers, have an efficiency qualifier. So I'll give you a basic example. Let's say it's 10% up to 120 grand in revenue per rep. And then if they hit 150 grand, it goes to 12%. With a qualifier of X collected dollar per booked call. Ah, gotcha. Right. Parametric. Yeah, that's what I was saying, too. So, well, and I didn't say you were wrong. I just I didn't know if you were saying the same. I like qualifier. That's a better one. It's a qualifier. It's like you're not qualified to accept that bonus without these other things. I like that. So to recap all account planes, you start with OTE, you build it in whatever customer acquisition model that exists. Um, you know, you have your basic metrics that are going to get get you there. Come up with accelerators to incentivize top performers. Have qualifiers so you don't mess up and pair training with whatever you're actually expecting them to do. Interesting. Yeah, we do that actually for some of the seuite things that are like uh let's use an example, but like a CPA paired with a volume metric, right? Like it has to be like anybody can hit a $50 CPA, let's say if you only sell two units a month, but like you need to sell like x amount of hundreds plus this and that like you know they come together and then they build this beautiful thing and it's very simple math once all you know these three are hit. It's like here's your simple chart at this number it's this at this number it's this or percentage or whatever. That's a great comp plan. And dude, the last note I'll say on that, nobody likes making mistakes in the moment, but I'm so grateful for the mistakes that I've made, dude, because I get such there's so many times I make a mistake and I'm like stoked. I'm like, that's awesome that I just learned that. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made with comp plans is I had an an operational role, a director level operational role, and I it was a labor efficiency ratio that it was intended to be improved. So, how efficient their time was would get me a better ROI. And basically, I had the concept of I want them to buy their bonus. If they increase efficiency, I can pay them more and it doesn't cost me anything because their output's higher and we get more done. That's the concept. It's a great concept. I I still do that concept. Comp plan was wrong, though, because I incentivize this person based on project completion. Guess what this person didn't do? all the other [ __ ] things they're supposed to do cuz they they're like, "Yeah, I'll just hit everything. I'm just going to do only that because as soon as I finish, I get bonus." Yeah. And I was like, "Wow, that is a real life example of the power of a wrong comp plan." Yeah. 100%. All right. Tell me if we're wonky. So, this has evolved 42 times, right? And again, we do this in-house. So, we have learned this on our own. We've had different influences. We've had different things we consume. We've had different managers. Mhm. So in current state or W2, okay, they will sit that we use a metric called sales per booking. Sales per booking for us is all bookings that come to the person. Everything that comes from a calendarly that gets booked with them and every sale they have. Very simple. It was always the easiest number for us to track like from the OG days like literally have a calendarly logger basically of like sales rep name, date of call, boom, boom, boom, and then book and then uh closes right new units. That count is we call a sales per booking percentage. Okay? So we know what's good for us. So let's say let's use example numbers here, but let's say an 8%, a 10%, and a 12%. Let's say those sales per booking percentages, which really is a function of live call close rate and show rate, right? I want you to explain this one more time because it seems like it's going to be important to say if your structure is wonky or not, and I didn't understand it perfectly. So say it one more time. All bookings to all sales that they get. So a sales rep, you're just talking about booked call close rate instead of live call close rate. Okay. Yes. We just call it sales per booking just because that was what we called the things on the sheet way back in the day. So it's SPB. So we have that and we'll use 8 10 and 12% and again it's a function of live call close and show rate right at those different tanches they'll make 8 n 10 points. Okay. In addition to this so that's like the core mean potatoes. We are W2 so you have a draw base. So it's, you know, federal minimums or whatever. It's XYZ. You'll have people who just hit that one when bad weeks or whatever and they still get paid that over X amount of time. If they have that over X amount of weeks, it's not good. Pipped, done. Right. They stay at the space. We also track RO, return on rep, which is what you're saying, which is how much dollar does it cost? If it's $100 for bookings and they get a 100 bookings, then how much did they cash collect? How much did they cost in commissions? And then like that math equation, what's the return on the rep? We don't actually use that for anything. It's just a metric that's tracked. And then the only other one that is tied to compensation directly they get draw they get clawbacks right on it on everything. Um and then there's a bonus framework that exists that they get $1 per point of cash collected. Okay. So it's just points that are basically just cash collected dollars or points but on times that we want more availability that doesn't exist. What does that actually mean? $1 on points. So if they're 80% collected they only get 80 bucks. Yes. On every seller total. It's straight up cash collected. First 30-day cash collected is points. But like this might be the first wonky part if I'm understanding it right because the most that they could make is 100 bucks in. No. So cash collected is points. So if someone collects 100k throughout the week, they get 100,000 points, which is how many dollars? Which then there's this bonus pool that exists. But then where I'm going with this is there is weekends they get 1.5x points on cash collected and on holidays and stuff. So it was always to incentivize. Were you a [ __ ] credit card company, bro? You have a whole rewards program that brings Yeah. And it makes it so it incentivizes and if you close this many sales, you're going on a trip to Hawaii, dude. And on Saturdays, if you slang 10 G's, you get 15,000 points instead of 10,000 points. Yeah. Okay. And then our pay periods are Sunday to following Saturday. So two weeks because we do bi-weekly payroll W2. Okay. In that in that range, they're closing all their deals. They're getting all their 8 n 10 commissions. They're doing that, right? That all exists. Then they're pushing they incentivize to the it's really just volume of cash collected, right? But you get these bonuses if you decide to work on weekends and like try and push for that if you optimize around weekends or holidays or any that stuff. We started this when it was $1099 because you couldn't tell people directly when to work. Now we're W2 so like we could just have shifts and like specifics around there and not have to incentivize and pay more out of pocket to work a weekend or holiday or whatever depending, right? You can have shifts and all that kind of stuff. But we still have this in place. These then will kick in. And I'm blanking on the numbers, which is probably the whole [ __ ] point of this, but like it's like let's say 60,000 cash collected is like a 3k bonus, a 6K, 9K, 12K bonus that are from these bonus pools. And we've had sales reps that have hammered it and done hundreds of thousands of cash collected and hundreds of thousands of points that then hit these big ones. And like the thing that changes though is the percentage climbs relatively aggressively when they start to get in these bonus pools to where instead of making 8 n 10 like it can be 13 14 like 15 some range but again it's only on like the top performer and only on that week that they're crazy top performing. The median average does roll down to like whatever range. We can talk about that more but like it's healthy. Like if you're if you're a killer rep like you're cracking cash. Yeah. So as a company and then how make it wonky and whatever and like the big question they always have is the sales for booking. They're like why I can't control shows and it's like okay well some reps will have a 60% show and some will have a 40. It's like why right like you at some level can control your shows not well and they also can control rescheduling working pipeline. Yeah. And we have everything set to like auto rebook with them. They have their own dedicated links that don't count towards that sales per booking number if they like rebook them themselves. Like we have like all that stuff as optimized as we can. But all to say, top reps crush and the average lands back in whatever bucket. So it's like, is that too variant? Is it something simpler like 8 10 12 that exists? So I'm going to break down a few things. Um, let me just first say, let's pretend the numbers are great. Y, let's say the numbers themselves actually work. The one thing that's wrong with it is it's it's way too complicated for my liking. I I will bet you that most people that just watched this don't know what you explain. I think I probably didn't explain it that well either. Well, it's just complic it's complic like I want to explain a comp plan in like a paragraph and everybody understands it. That's just always what I liked because it also sets clarity and like I've I've actually dude we have we have so many reps I've seen that like reps get really frustrated when they constantly have to like use a spreadsheet to figure out what they're going to make. They want really quick math. So, but but again that's just kind of a side note of like it's complicated. Does it functionally serve a purpose? Um, here's the thing. You're focused on incentivizing the right behaviors. So, I think you have the right considerations in place. I liked book call. Uh, I liked book call close rate that whatever that metric you call it. Sales per booking. Yes. PB. Now, now here's the thing. Do you have only one price point? No. Well, we have internal pay plans. We have But offer price. Yes. What's your price point? Sevenish. Okay. Nothing else. One offer price point. Okay. So, it doesn't matter as much. That's why I asked it. But booking to close rate, the booking close rate that we're talking about that you don't have a collections meter in there. Now, you have Yes. No. And I have it, but no, it's not anywhere in the it's not directly tied to the comp plan. It's not directly tied to anyone. And but that's one of the issues. Now, obviously, I like to assume that most people have integrity and are trying to actually do a good job, just not cheat a system, but that system can be cheated if they want. If I have a bonus coming and all I have to do is increase my close rate, I'm just slamming the easiest path of least resistance deals. I'm going for the lowest payment plans and lowest price points and I could manipulate it. Again, I like to assume that most people aren't doing that cuz they, you know, whatever. But I I don't I can assume that. I'm not going to have a gap in the comp plan that allows it though when it happens. So that's I'm just saying points. That's one point. That's one point, right? Um the second point is um there's a lot of context that is required here. So, one thing that's really important with accelerators and bonus plans, it's another really good tip for anybody building comp plans is you should really only have your top the percentage changes based on how many reps you have, but only your top 10 to 20% if you have a really small team, 30% should hit that because what and I think people don't one one other issue with comp plans, they don't adjust the bar frequently enough. So, let's say that the you're an accelerator is at 150. Like I was saying, you you pay more when they hit 150 grand in revenue and you've done it so long that like most your team hits it now. Dude, you got to move the bar back. You got to adjust it because now you're overpaying and that's great. Everyone's improving, but they're going to settle there because you were initially incentivizing them to push harder. They don't have to anymore because they're better. Everyone's winning. Yeah. Lead flow gets better. Pricing So many now. Now, there's a place where there's a give and pull. I'm not trying to like pull the rug under reps. I want them to do well. I want them to stay with us for as long as possible. So, you might get to a point where you're like, you know what, if I don't care, I'm paying everyone this. If they all hit it, I'm now happy and content with the numbers. So, that's another side of it. But, like, you have to constantly re-evaluate where that bar is. Um, and that's what I was going to say is like when you have those accelerators like you have to you have to look at that like am are are too many people hitting it? Is it too easy to hit? And that goes back to the model in the first place. I like to model things out for a B player so all the A players are going to exceed it. Yeah, that's that's the way I look at it. Um, other than that, you know, I think you have good considerations. Um, I I think there's a more simplistic way to do it. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, because well I mean what we were trying to achieve and then it was like adding things together but sales per booking is based on the count right so the the unit count so it's not just incentivizing just like only piffs and only this well that's why like my favorite metric is collected dollar per booked call because it's guess what it's not collected dollar per live call I'm still going off booked call which is what you want but I'm going a layer deeper because collected dollar per booked call is accounting for collection rate and the average sales price, which matters if you have more than one offer level. Yeah. We call like new rorowaz versus 30-day cash versus right. Roughly. And like so I was talking I was talking to marketing the day and I was like listen like example numbers here. $100 per booking for per generated booking. If we get 400 over here you guys have 4x on the front. Like very simply put like that's the math. And they were like oh like because all these numbers all tie together in some way. It's like you can just zoom out. It's like or is it cost per sale? You're just going one layer or one layer showed you know live calls. The next layer is booked calls. the next layer is at like we can look at this in a million ways. But yeah, that was our goal of that and I'm sure it'll change. We just got a really good sales manager. Um it's not public I don't think yet but uh we just got a really good one that is I'm very excited for because I think it's finally like the they can run it like like I think we sometimes over micromanager is probably the wrong word but like kind of just like exist in a lot of the departments probably too much like we'll just kind of like plug in or like oh this or that and do what you said where it's like we almost like take away from them from being able to like fully express or lead and sometimes that's necessary right if there's like things going wrong or if like you need to kind of steer the ship. Yes. But like I'm excited about this person because I think that they're going to we're trying to build like the seauite reports to the seauite kind of vibe not like you know what I mean like as the collective there's four cores and it's like if we all meet together I facilitate that style like in there and then they all can collaborate and do their thing and then I'm adding this project manager person I was talking about that then can like help facilitate their project flow but we can make decisions together and like report together. I'm like if we can harmonize around that like that's my dream world. But where do you want to take this? I can go into seven models. I can go into I want to take me into some tactical [ __ ] that people want to know about sales models in a second here. Um I was going to say one comment before we left that which was uh what was it? Oh, it was just a quick comment that came to mind. Here's one thing that we do really well and I think it's something that a lot of companies don't have which is um there's there's two things that come to mind. Most sales managers in an organization I in this industry in this industry are the highest ranking salesperson in the org chart in this industry like dude most of these info products don't have sales managers sales directors VP of sales chief sales officer they don't have that so my point is this most companies hire a sales manager because they themselves aren't great at managing sales sales and then the sales managers, the highest rankings and most qualified salesperson in the organization. Where I'm getting with this is they don't have development themselves. Yeah. Real. And so you have So this is the big thing, dude, is like think about sales reps. We train every single day and on top of all of that training, then we have individual brand trainings throughout the week. So there's a lot of training. Well, what about the management training? So something that's really powerful of ours because we have a whole training center for our sales reps. It's called the 10 steps to wires from strangers. It's our way that we run sales calls. It's our whole proprietary selling framework. And then we have a whole sales training center for management and we do management development. Every single week we're training on different concepts and frameworks and methodologies and skill sets. And you just you made me bring it up because it's like there's so many of these questions that people don't know where to find it and it's like well there is no development for that stuff and and you know there's a there's an old saying business saying that says everybody rises to their own level of incompetency. Have you heard that? Yeah. Because it's like if you're really included everybody dude included it. Well well but here I think here here's the difference though and I guess anyone could do this but they usually don't. at the very top CEOs, business owners, we go invest, like I don't know about you, I go invest in things when I hit my peak. Yeah. If I don't have the expertise, I find someone who has it. I pay them to teach me what they know. Yeah. Now, most most of the time, not everybody, but most of the time, lower levels in the organization, they're not investing outside of the company. They're looking for their company to get it or they're they're looking to get it from the company. And if you don't have a way to to develop and continue to train management, there's nowhere to get that information. And so that's a really important piece that we have and we do that I think is what makes us just really good and consistent across the board from a from our sales management motion. Second thing, and I didn't actually think about this for a long time. Um, actually a a client voiced it to me and I was like, "Wow, I should say that more often cuz that's a huge value ad out of ours that I actually didn't realize until probably 6 months ago, which is this. You just did another podcast before this and um and uh you guys were talking about culture, right? Culture is really important especially in sales. You need high sales energy, you know, high perform performance culture." Well, one thing that we have is a is a triple figure headcount in our sales force. Well, even though all of our reps are dedicated on the brands that they work with, if I take on a couple hundred,000 account, they have two reps, $500,000 account, they have four or five reps, whatever it is, they are instantly in an ecosystem with that many freaking people, dude. Right? Triple headcount. I mean, they're on calls with a hundred other people at a time and training with reps. So, there's this like roaring sales energy that these other companies, they cannot duplicate it if they wanted to. And it's really interesting because in sales, there's two main motivators for sales reps. Money and acknowledgement because we're competitive individuals. Well, dude, do you want to be at the top of a leaderboard for a twoman team or in our organization when you're compared to that? So, like that's a big driving factor that like we just have and you get to benefit from all that energy even when you only actually have a couple reps on the account. So, I just wanted to say that because I think there are two really critical things that are interesting that other companies don't usually have. But, take me deep into like a series of rapid fire questions. A series of rapid fire. Yeah. Well, I mean, or slow fire. I don't know. Just slow fire. I feel like all I feel like every like I I go down this rabbit hole. So, like my next one is like, okay, cool. You have a setter, right? I just I'm going so tactical, but like you have a setter. So our example, I'm selfishly using this. We have setters that sit in three buckets. Okay. Okay. So our three buckets are auto set, which is going to be someone that comes from a low ticket for an ascension call. So like an onboarding, whatever, right? We call them auto because we auto book in them for 15 minutes zooms. They do the ascension call, which is getting them on with a closer. To be clear, the ascension's from the low ticket though in this case. Correct. So it's specifically that. So we don't autobook them with anything else. So, we've talked about doing it, but we haven't. Okay. We then have selfset, which is your classic like dial the CRM. This is a mixed bag of uh app no books, no show cancel, um just dialing the CRM, uh whatever lists of people just out of the CRM. That's self-s bucket. And then we have uh ad confirmations and that is literally a marketing booking comes in, speed, they claim it, there's no round robin. It's like whoever on it, call it, boom, boom, boom. Okay, those are But on that third bucket, did they book an inbound call or it was just an offer? Booked inbound. Everything's inbound. Complete booking. So they complete booking. Let's just recap tomorrow. First booking is Ascension upselles from low ticket. Um ascension set call with the closer. What then? What are set call the closer? Yeah, they're set. All Yeah. All they're doing is setting the call with the closer. Yes. For the ascension. No, but you said self book. So did they book the call with the setter from that funnel or with the closer? With the setter. Okay. That's what I mean. So sorry for all right. So low ticket ascension with the setter. Inbound booking. The second one is optin speed to lead. Uh technically we don't have it on optins. So it's application no books. It's no show cancels. It's like we have to Okay. No bookings though. Dialing prioritize speed to lead. Third bucket is inbound bookings speed to lead. Correct. Really smart and and and the the only person that I've talked to recently that does that outside of us. I I don't actually know anybody else. Um, and I want to get into that in a second. But you explain the buckets. What's the question? So, the the two that are uh easiest, simplest, I don't want to interchange those words, but I'm going to here. Uh, are auto ones that come in that are 15 minutes that are like just your calendar is just 15-minute bookings back to back to back. Those and the ad confirmation ones that uh you're basically just speedily dialing. All you're doing is having not again, not all you're doing. I understand it's like a very val crazy valuable um uh nicotine. Um but those ones are 5 to 12 minutes whatever it's preframe it's yeah you know it's a zoom call hey like you know basically qualifier check and then if they don't they'll unconfirm them. Those buckets are one compensation one percentage and then the selfset are more difficult. They take more time. It's you dial 100 you get your five answer. You know you do that right which our actual connection rate is crazy high because they're only hitting the newest leads. So, we haven't optimized the dialer system or any of that stuff to like really manage and hit the 350,000 phone numbers we have that are not purchas. So, those are different comp buckets all with the base that pours across them and they like now are like, "Oh, I'd only rather be on this one because I can make more comp over here or this." And like the one that makes a majority of the comp is the ad confirmation because they just get that one right now. the math on this and what we're trying to solve for on show rates and whatever. They'll claim right now, call it 60%, 55% to 60%. They will confirm. The other ones aren't even answering them. So, there's like a marketing issue, right? It's like they can't they like they instantly will dial them. They won't even answer them. They won't text back. They won't anything. So, it's like no, of those buckets, we'll get like a 84% show rate. We'll get like an 80 or a 68 to 72% show rate, and then we'll get like an 84% show rate. the economics on the ascension one insanity but we just can't like that's marketing thing again keep cost per book or uh net CPA at whatever rate so that the throughput makes sense on the math but like the economics and the percents amazing ad confirmation that they confirm amazing self-set lowest one of shows so we're like dancing this line on like okay cool we can just basically bump the floor of kind of these which we're which we actually just did so we bump the floor on on comms as a percentage for some of these buckets but it's like keeping them dedicated I could go down a million roads of this, but it's like we need dialer systems that are in place. We still don't have one of those. We're like shopping different softwares. We just got new recommendation trying to like optimize it so that their efficiency is there so they can make the comp that they like, you know, get in that 5'8 range and we have ones that hit that like we have the sickos who hit that and then we do the kind of player coach thing at some level over those pods. But we're just navigating that and we have a really good uh outbound director, setter manager person that came from your world and you'd know the name, right? But like, yeah. So, I'm just trying to understand like bucket-wise, does that make sense? Should they be dedicated because sometimes they can't because there's not enough necessarily flow or they just have overall capacity to do multiple of them. Let's break down a few things because there's so much that you could go into. Um, I believe for the most part there's it depends for everything, right? It's like the attorney answer, which I hate, but it depends for a lot of things. There's a lot of factors. But when you have enough volume where you can have all those positions specialize and still be enough opportunity, I like to do that because it's less complexity. Like at scale, you should specialize as much as you can. For example, if you have an upsell funnel, not like an a low ticket to high ticket, like a high ticket to higher ticket, like a back-end acceleration ascension upsell funnel. Well, if you only have a handful of opportunities, you have the same closers do it. But if it builds into a beast of an engine itself, it's a separate team. Yeah, we have a separate team. There you go. So, same logic there. Um, now where but here's the considerations that we look at and you kind of even you hinted at it. If there's very low earning potential in one bucket and it's like very imbalanced and you determine that it's not enough. So, it goes back to financial modeling, dude. Everything is done in spreadsheets, dude. Everything. Because here's what I look at. I've done this math so many times, by the way, on actually the same thing you're talking about. And then in other closer examples where if this if the earning potential in bucket one, and for the listeners, by the way, don't even worry about anything you said if you got lost on all the buckets because it's confusing. Just listen to this analogy. There's three buckets. Doesn't matter what they are. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing this on like hard mode and there's just like a much easier way to do it. And I also think that my uh articulation around some of these maybe isn't the best it could be. So, apologies to every No, it's not it's not even that. You're actually articulating it very well. It's just there's so much to it that if you already understand it or Yeah. Well, and and and you could just get lo like, dude, I don't know. I don't know if it's just me or what, but like because of the time, I'm tired. I'm just like, wait, what did he already say? But you're saying it well. It's 11:30 p.m. by the way, guys. 11:30. Yeah. Um, but here's the point. If bucket A is performs way less in terms of earning potential and bucket C is way freaking higher disproportionately. Well, here's what will happen. You'll actually as a company have to allocate more commissions as a percentage because if you want to specialize, the only way to get the earning potential here is to pay way more in a rate. But as a blended rate, yeah, it's okay because they're all sitting right here. And so you just make it a part of the job set. And and and dude, I refuse to have the ta the tail wag the dog. Meaning I will not have like an attitude from a rep dictate how we run a business. Yeah. There is a tradeoff in employer, employee, relationship, rep to management, whatever you want to call it. I'm going to do my best to put you in the best financial situation. I expect you to do the same for us. That's how it works. And there are some things it's it's a culture. It's an expectation. It's a level of professionalism where hey, we need you to do these things. We understand that they're not the best money maker for you, but we need those as a company to be able to pay you everything else we pay you and provide the opportunity we pay you over here. So sometimes it's just a culture expectation thing if people complain about it. But it is harder to specialize in those things, right? Yeah. The second thing that I look at is does it disrupt the workflow? And this actually matters because if you have a speed tole bucket where they're just buried in all day long here, here's a good here's a good bucket as an example. Midt buyers where you're not trying to upsell right away and you're trying to upsell later. So let's say they bought a one or $2,000 course. They already went through a sales process. They bought a downell. That's a bucket that we want to revisit in 3 4 weeks call it. But speed to lead is not important. They already spent a couple thousand dollars. They're a customer. We're gonna get a hold of them, right? So, we don't need speed to lead. Well, speed to lead is where we have to prioritize our time. So, if we're dialing that list, you're breaking the workflow cuz it's two different job sets. So, in those instances, you could do one of two things. We could specialize or you just break up the day. And so, we'll have like speed to lead all day long this period of time, you know? you do this and we offset it with the setters which you said you don't like making things complicated that does make it complicated sometimes you have to at scale but does that make sense what I'm saying if it breaks the workflow then we get into those types of conversations but now I'm going to answer this in the simplest way possible because those things make sense right these are the considerations like I I'm actually I'm really big on that I don't like to be like this is the way it's done you actually said that last podcast referring to something different but like I don't like to be like this is how you do it I like to say this is how I evaluate it and these are how I make decisions because then people could apply it to their own situations with their own context. Um it's just a framework. Um the biggest thing is the the we control everything a setter does in the tech stack itself. Remove all critical thinking and it comes with priority buckets and auto assignment rules in the dialer. And so in the dialer, we have a bunch of different rules on how leads are prioritized, how they enroll in a new sequence, how they auto unenroll in a sequence, how they're take it out and put it in a different bucket, which is the unenrollment part. The rep doesn't even know what's happening. Yeah. All they have to do is press start. Yeah. And they're dialing. Now they can see all of the contact cards. So when somebody answers, they know, oh, this is the person, this is the situation, this is that. Sometimes there's some talk track variability based on who it is, but they don't control that because you talked about efficiency. Dude, good luck getting setters to make money and actually being profitable for your company if they're trying to manually go through that part. Yeah. Okay, let's talk on this because that was another part of it that So, we're shopping this right now and we don't have one. So, we're we're on Alaware for the entire from CS to closer to setter and they have their power dialer. You pop open a list. You basically go through the pages, it adds them all in like a little thing in the Google Chrome extension, you click add to power dialer, moves it into a queue and does that. Great for a couple people who are just dialing specific list, but when you start to like over Exactly. It's not the game plan. So it's it's not like an evergreen thing. It's like a list drop. Yeah. And like me and my tech mind are like, okay, I don't want to like do this whole push it into these other lists that are on this other software and then have them like live over here. or I want this two-way sync or dream state where on HubSpot is like an overlay situation that's like those lists already are active. They have every data point in the world. I can instantly see who's now on site, who's been on site 120 times and is on a review page and hasn't booked a call. Like I can have lists for that and like these flows. I'll tell you this, it exists. We have it. We do it and I'll tell you it all. Okay, I'll give the basics on the podcast, but it's a technical answer and most people aren't ready to do it anyways. But but offline I could show you exactly how we do that. Um, and we actually just went through a revamp because every once in a while we look at these metrics and we find more efficient ways to do it. So that's exactly what we do. Um, and it's it's everything. Uh, and and I I'll say this at this point in my company, I really do focus on like CEO tasks running the business. I I which I'm I'm proud of in the sense that like I focus on growing the company, strategic planning and overseeing like we were just talking about the strategic operating cadence, right? So when it started off I had to build all these things myself took forever. I mean dude the f like our CRM configuration SOP it's 98 pages by the way I built Yeah. 98 pages and we configure that on our clients in the first 72 hours of working with them. huge efficiency. But here's the thing, it took me years to get it there. So many different variations. But now I haven't updated that thing in like maybe 18 months to two years cuz my operations team is constantly doing that now because we're always updating whatever. So I I don't I can't give like every technical detail, but from my un So there is a two-way sync. What we build is we build smart views in the CRM that sync with the actual lists in the dialer. I think they're actually called campaigns in the dialers, right? They sync. There's web hooks and I think we use Zapier for something. It's a complex structure. Um, but it works seam it's a complex structure but works seamlessly. It's not clunky and it's just two-way syncing based on the unenrollment the enrollment and unenrollment criteria. So the unenrollment and un sorry the enrollment and unenrollment criteria and how they make it to the list in the CRM and then um the actual dispositions that are in the CRM. It's they're communicating when to take it out of the list and when when marketing action events and dispositions. So like at like uh in our example an opt an app a booking or whatever like those action events enroll or unenroll as well as other criteria and then disposition on what happened after the call. Yes. And so what what we used to do um this is a few iterations ago is we had the priority buckets perfect in the CRM but we still had a manual we'll call it dialing process cuz we'd have to pull up the right list click to dial go through it and then there's all these clunky things where it was like well then I have to go back to the top of the list and it only dials in this order. Like there's there's things that are too hard to communicate on a podcast but the rep's workflow was messy. Yeah. I could even though the buckets were correct. Yeah. So, we're like, "Okay." Oh, and by the way, speed to lead is actually almost impossible cuz even you could have notifications, you could have alerts, but they're in different lists and it gets confusing. So, we removed all that now where all dude, all they have to do is click that button and it's all campaigning and based on the amount of contacts, it continues to take them out or put them back in day by day, however many contacts you set it at. And then it also in the campaign is automating automating all the written and text communication. Interesting. Are you doing anything with blue sending versus green sending? I don't I know them. They they they contact me a lot. Same. Um with green messages. No, I'm kidding. Wouldn't that be funny? No. Um I I have I I legitimately have nothing bad to say about them, but I'll say two things. The first is I don't solve problems. I don't solve things that aren't a big enough problem to me. Yeah. Um their value proposition that's not the main bottleneck we're trying to solve right now. I I I just haven't wanted to reallocate resources on that. And because of our agency model, I validate, duplicate, roll out to everybody. Yeah. Dude, change the entire context of how you do things. Yeah. I have to validate, duplicate, roll. Here's what I mean. Change the whole context. I try it in one use case that makes the most sense on one brand. If it works, I see if I could duplicate it in another use case. If I do, we roll it out to everybody and standardize because we have to have a standardized tech stack to operate in the way that we do at scale. It would blow up your in your Yeah, I didn't want I haven't wanted to go through that. I don't want to do that project. Second thing, um, dude, maybe I'm wrong with this, but like I think that there's I don't believe in the business model of like am I really going to have that drastic of of different and I know they have all their case studies. I know, I get it. But guess what, dude? I've also seen a lot of things that are the opposite of it. Yeah. And I've had conversations with people that haven't had the results and I've I've seen people that have had just as good with green text. I think that it speaks to the actual workflow and the tech stack itself. And so for those reasons, I haven't prioritized it. Yeah. So we rolled it on app notebooks only. So no user anything. It's all AI, all API call everything. Yeah. So the clunkiness of it is is use is like having to use it have multiple users in it. It dedicates one line to one contact. Yeah. So like if it passes from a closer or from a setter to a closer, they're on the same phone number and it's like, "Oh, just give them the story that like you're in the same office and you handed the phone over and like that type of thing because you can't like move phone numbers and like and you can only have 50 contacts per line per day." So then like you have a pool of numbers and then it's like which one is it texting from and like which ones do you own, but they all go in the same bucket and then users over top. So like there for volume and then across multi- account like how you would do crazy but we rolled it on the AI app no books and it did get us a plus 50% response rate from like a 20 something percent. So like that part was working on speed to lead blue message versus green message but we haven't rolled it full. We're about to roll it full. Um, we were likely going to do it for closers, but now we're going to have setters because we go back and forth on like ad comps and like should a closer just handle them or should we automate a portion of it from the closer and like just have it there or should we continue to let like or have setters do it because they can do the speed of lead and whatever all this stuff. But yeah, we'll dude we so the biggest thing that we did too is uh we b we do bulk messaging in our setter workflows based on where they're at in the campaign. We do bulk workflows based what? So if we have so it's it's hard to explain but in the campaign we there's the enrollment and unenrollment criteria. They come in and out of the list every day based on contact attempt. So for example nobody gets more than a couple dials a day. If we hit that list if we hit that lead a couple dials that day they get removed temporarily until the next day. Yes. But there's certain critical points based on the workflows that we've created in the in the touch points when we want them to receive email and text communication. Let's just say that their next text they get is after the third or fourth dial. Well, all of these people will accumulate there and then it it it b it drops these messages on them. So, so there's two. Some are just automated based on the flow, but some of them they uh we have like activation blocks in our day where we'll drop a bulk text from a bunch of these people and and it's it makes it so much more efficient. Imagine have imagine sending the same message and having the same response to 50 people at the same time instead of different conversations all throughout the day. So we found ways that some are evergreen and they go out based on where they're at in the campaign and some of them have the we have these blocks so we can attack the same conversations during that time. Does that make sense? So it it's just an efficiency thing. Um and I and and and man I I was just about to say one other thing. Um oh the only other thing I was going to say is you said something really important. Uh, again, nothing against Simbau at all. I mean, uh, maybe they have a great and there's eight of the platforms now. There's so many different ones. Maybe they have the best product that's ever existed. I literally am not saying an opinion on it. All I'm saying is I am extremely careful to the point of like almost speaking in an absolutes. I almost will never work with a platform that's new. Yeah. because it's too much risk to my clients and I and I can't like I can't afford to standardize something and roll it across everything um for something that is like constantly has holes and constantly breaking and they're changing and their model's different now and so yeah we lean validation and speed remember yeah we'll lean on the edge we'll we'll play with things like that and like but again we do it in a use case for example like an app notebook that's AI that doesn't have us as long as you can mitigate the risk is the point but like I you We talk to these guys and we have strong tech on our team and they have very obviously strong tech on theirs, but like we have a Slack connect that has multiple of their tech team in it and my our tech and their tech are like constantly like, "Oh, we need this change or oh this HubSpot viewer like oh this completely doesn't work or like eight of these lines just went off and it's like oh here's 30 more and then they're going to reassign and like they're constantly doing that." So to imagine that then with also users in the platform like your team and then across however many accounts you guys have that's crazy like that is it's not like enough. And again, I you know, Sam is cracks me up. Their ads, Sam Queen, like their ads crack me up. I ads. He's doing the the blender thing, the picketing outside or whatever he calls. The Trump one I saw was freaking funny. He just he just runs it. So, yeah. No, that's I definitely want to talk to you offline about the software stack specific for that. Um because and we we probably have time, I'm guessing, for for two more quick topics. So what what are the two like power questions that we can end this on um or or value that we can give? Two power questions. How bigger bigger thinking of this where do you this is completely not probably helpful to most people but helpful to me and I think bigger for this. How do you view this? No, seriously though, but like it'll be important to a certain person. How are you viewing scaling this thing and what is like an actual like is it more volume of what you're doing or is it you more out of it? You just had life changes. You are now married and we're on a honeymoon and doing all that like whether your life changes or not like where are you trying to take this? You said I want to go, you know, I'm more CEO now and I'm doing strategic decisions. I'm not in the ops like but you also say things like I'm in it in this way and this way. Where do you want to be and where you grow this thing? Yeah. Um, and that's valuable as a perspective that people have because and from mine before you answer that is like half the time I'm like, "Oh, I want to pull myself out of this so that for multi-reason one that it can sell without me, right? That I'm not in it in it. And then two that like I can try and do the whole like buy back your time truly where you do higher leverage activities that you actually do, which half the time is not true and you're just like not doing anything, right?" And like so I dance that line and then also lifestyle wise like 99% work and like all of a sudden I torch personal life and it's like that's not the model I likely want to live out for the next I I actually like that you took it here to end on because we get out of the trenches for a second but we talked about some good business ownership. I I have a lot of lots of thoughts. Um, I'll tell you this, not and I think this true for any business owner, but like I'm not naive enough to think that everyone that works for me likes me. Um, I I I think I have a really good relationship with most everyone I interact with, but I will tell you I truly believe they all respect me because I am a high output individual. I am in the trenches and no matter how many things I delegate, no matter how many things I fire myself from, no one ever works more than I do in this business. Nobody. I am always identifying what's the most high leverage thing to do next. And I am constantly just inundating myself with new sets of massive initiatives and high leverage stuff. And I I work seven days a week. We're at 11 o'clock on a Friday night. Like I did the same last night, you know, with Jeremy here. So, um I I'm very high output in that sense and uh and I believe that's important for culture as well. Like that's I'm not going to expect people to like I don't even expect anyone to work even as close as much to as I do, right? Like so there's there's that element to it. Um now you make me go to a couple different places because you started off describing this question as like where do you see yourself going, you know, with the business? And one thing is to hit a level of scale that that we're actually at right now and where we want to continue to go, we we have to have both. We have to have quality and quantity. Meaning like we have to have volume just to continue to scale to an extent. But the way that we grow is definitely prioritized and emphasized around quality. We want to go deep, not wide. We end up with a lot of accounts any a lot of accounts anyways but we never compromise the quality of the relationship and and here these are things that I always struggle with like do I say it do I not is it a secret but I'm like I don't think it's a secret but it is a it is something that I consider to be an X factor of us. I always say that that when I'm taking on engagements I'm underwriting. It's, yeah, it's sales in the sense that like I have to get my client the the the leads um buying and trust to say yes to me, but at the end of the day, it's a dual evaluation. And that's not a sales tactic. On a slow week, Ryan, I don't Some weeks I say the same things over and over. I just said this a couple times this week, but on a slow week, maybe I have five new calls a week for new deals. On a busy week, 10. By the way, that's another thing you might hear that's interesting. I have not delegated this because of what I'm explaining right now. It's the single biggest lever because it's not about closing a deal and then pushing them to fulfillment. As soon as I say yes, their problems become my business's problems. Their product becomes my business's product. Their opportunity and scalability becomes my opportunity and scalability. And since there are such large deals in most cases, it's one of the most leveraged things that I could do. So, I still hold on to this right now. And on a slow week, five new opportunities. On a busy week, 10 usually between that range. I usually say once a month. I say or sorry, I say yes to maybe once a month, maybe two. I think the most ever is like three, but it's usually one or two a month and some months zero. Uh of new relationships. And and so my point is I look for scalable models, offers, I believe in economics that make sense to me, business owners I get along with along with that have alignment that have the right scaling intelligence that I could port like like the right partners all I look for that and that's our path forward right now in the like the short term. I'm going to go it's like an onion. I'm going to go bigger and bigger. A little bit bigger than that. Um, I uh I really like this space. There's a lot of things I don't like about it and I have zero intentions to exit the space like to leave it. Um, there's so much opportunity here, dude. So much. It's such a massive industry and and there's just significant the growth profile for a business like mine and a business like yours in this space is spectacular. It's hard to find. So I'm not leaving that by any means, but I have identified other verticals that are great markets with similar growth profiles with similar economics that I can that that need this service. And so that is the next phase is we are uh Q3 for us is SAS. Interesting. Q3 is all about SAS. Um we're investing aggressively there. I'm I am building that department from the top down. Uh meaning like we're not hiring reps and trying to transfer things over. Like I'm I'm I'm hiring director level positions to build that out that are in the SAS space. Um and and and and it's there's a lot of really successful comps. There's outsourced sales agencies doing $und00 million a year in that space. So it's it's already validated. So I like that market a lot. And I think that um I' I've done a lot of research around it. And I think we could I don't want to say disrupt. I think that's kind of cheesy to be like I'm going to disrupt the space. Like there's huge players in it. But I'm going to be heavily differentiated in our approach there just by understanding the competitors that are available. So that's kind of phase two. Now I'll talk about something that's interesting. I think it's for when some when somebody asked me, Josh, are you trying to sell this business? What's your goal? Well, here's how I like to answer that. I think it would be stupid for any sophisticated business owner. The qualifier there is sophisticated, by the way. I think it'd be stupid for any sophisticated business owner to not focus on maximizing enterprise value. Everything you do, even if you want to hold on to it for the rest of your life and pass it down for generations, should be focused on building the most valuable business. By the way, even if you just want to keep it forever and just chill back, you're going to do most of the same actions that you would do to build it to sell because at the end of the day, it's just building a valuable business and and mitigating risk. And you do do those two things that you have optionality either way. So everything I do is focused on making it a valuable business and maximizing enterprise value. And I don't I have so much opport I I love what I do. I'm passionate about it. If I'm in a vehicle that's I'm passionate about I'm really freaking good at that makes a ton of money. Like I the only reason to switch would be a distraction. It would be shiny object syndrome for me to be like, "Now, let's go do that other thing over there." I already love it. I'm already freaking good at it. I spent my whole career in high ticket sales and it it's very it's a very profitable, scalable model. So, to be like, "Yeah, I'm trying to exit, you know, right now." I'm not. I I have so much I want to take it so much further. But here's where I'll say where like I feel like I have a very different narrative on this because uh I'm very passionate about M&A buying, selling. It just fascinates me and I love scaling business. I love studying it. I think people feel that when they hear hear me talk and speak. I I just I I like sophisticated business, dude. I'm a I'm an athlete. Business is my sport and I want to play in the pros. Rookie [ __ ] is annoying to me, right? So, I study this stuff all the time and everybody talks about like, well, you got to remove yourself off the org chart and fire yourself for this to be able to sell and you have to be, you know, and and dude, I and and I believe in most of these things based on, you know, goals. But I used to always say myself, the more valuable you are to the business, the less valuable your business is. But here is the part that I actually completely changed my perspective on after years of studying this stuff. That is important. If you want to have a lights off exit, meaning you want to sell and completely step out. Yeah, 100%. So, what what I feel like nobody really talks about cuz every every single exit advisor or program that focuses on exiting, they're talking about build yourself off the org chart, delegate all responsibilities, you need a C new CEO for six to 12 months before you sell. Well, sure if you want to go lay on the beach after that. I've decided whenever that point comes, if if if that if I get to a point where I'm selling, dude, I'm staying on. I want to take my company to an exit. I'm saying when I get to that, which I'm not there, right? If because I just have so much further I want to go and there's a lot of transformative stuff I want to do. But when I get to that point, nothing excites me more than being backed by the right private equity partner where I'm the horse they bet on, where I can play with people that are just like leagues beyond me. Like, I want a big firm and the the valuation target that I want, it's going to need to be a big fund, which means that there's big players involved to work side by side with them and and and just, you know, have the the fuel and the leverage of of private equity. I want to be the guy to keep taking it and running with it. And I have a couple relationships that did exactly that. And I I won't say names and details just because of who it was, but or just because it's their personal information, even though it is public info, but I I was I was just hanging out with one of them the other day. And uh he his first exit was 100 million to private equity. Stayed on as CEO. Second second exit was 500 million. He still stayed on at CEO. So he rolled over each time. And uh now the company has a a $900 million valuation. He's still the single uh the single largest individual shareholder. He's now off the CEO position. He's the chairman. And this next bite at the apple, he'll be he'll be done. No more rollovers. Um but when I look at that, I'm like, dude, I want that. Yeah. Money, sure, but not even bec like strategically, dude. the rollovers make the most sense because like the second bite of the apple and the third bite of the apple it's usually way more than the first bite of the apple if you have a good private equity partner and those guys know what they're doing but so it's financially makes sense but second of all that sounds like a lot of fun dude yeah skill set development growth skill set develop dude so so that's why my take is is different and if you asked me even a year ago I would have told you yeah dude I'm trying to build myself off the org chart as fast as possible. Not even cuz I have exit intentions yet just cuz I was I heard from everybody that that's what you're supposed to do. But then I when like I've been lucky and fortunate enough that I'm grateful for to to to build really close relationships that are people that are like doing it in a really big way and I was like wait a second I realized like dude that's only if you want your journey to end when you sell. Yeah. And I don't. Mic drop. Mic drop. Yeah. that is I'm I'm I am tired I'm torn a little on where I sit my opinion of my version of that uh and especially because we have multiple partners as well so like who is already players in that who already kind of is doing that or not and as we scale into that but same with you a year ago I would have said this is a cash flow biz and we're optimizing for time to cash return and whatever and now it's completely different it's completely different from a year ago I think dude just as a good business owner everyone needs to focus on the path to maximizing enterprise value to give yourself those options. I don't even and again we talk about this I talk about this on a lot of these and like I think I know XYZ or I hear this new thing and it changes my frame. Like I'll say it a thousand times like I only know what I know in this and like continuously it's shifting and changing and like how I view it and what is important or what is not. So there's a little birdie that's like oh everyone wants to be W2 and we make this switch and it's like wait we did it too early. It's too much cost. it's this it's really not that important especially for XYZ role or like these different things and I'm like oh so like my education around it needs to be it needs to evolve so that it makes sense that we're building in the right direction but like it's definitely in the cards there's some stuff I'll talk to you outside of this that's like oh wow that makes way more sense for what they're talking about like this I always say exit velocity of info coaching but like core and there's these uh additional pieces that make it like a no-brainer and it's like okay so that's what we're building towards and I will talk to that offline line, but this was good. Yeah, we're gonna get kicked out of here. The lights are gonna The lights are gonna turn off in a second. We'll end here, dude. Uh I just the last comment on that topic, though. Um I've seen this in every industry that I've been in, but specifically in coaching and info products. Um so funny, man. They hear these things. How do I want to say this? People try to build them out themselves out too quickly because they think that they're supposed to. me I I literally did this included in the beginning and also my role and dude the company starts to suffer they stop making less money be and and dude never sacrifice money and success now cuz a concept of what you think you're supposed to be in the future and that's the balance I play everything I'm focused on is enterprise value to the extent that I don't sacrifice the business model now and and and a perfect example of that is like when When I say I study this, I really study this. And I've paid tens of thousands of dollars to consultants, mentors, relationships that we we talk about all these things. And uh if I was just focus on enterprise value for an exit and I was okay sacrificing now, um dude, I'd probably shift industries. Yeah. But at the risk of sounding arrogant and and that's not my goal, but like we crush it. So why would I do that? It would make no sense. So my point is like, okay, well diversification and optionality. Let's start doing these other paths that create those options just so we're attractive at some point, you know, in the future. But um but I'm I'm here to stay, man. Like this is like the cash flow and the cash cow now. But again, like I think I've seen so many business owners that like read some book or joined some mastermind or hired some coach and they're like, "Oh, build myself off the org chart." And they think they're like, you know, and it's funny too in this space because you could go like, "Dude, we had a client we took from 300 grand a month to almost 2 million a month in four and a half, five months." And when you do that to somebody, and by the way, this person doesn't have this um mindset. They're they're a really good client and I appreciate this person a lot. But a lot of the times when you create that type of growth for somebody, they [ __ ] dude, they walk around like they're Elon Musk. Yeah. And they're like, "Oh, yeah." And so, dude, instantly it's like you have a big month for them and like the like I've had this happen to a client and we'll end we'll end with this, man. I had this happen to a client. I freaking we had like the the biggest month they ever had, the second biggest month they ever had, and then they sent a Slack message to us that like a an announcement that was like, "As as of this date forward, I will no longer be handling any Slack communication or on any calls. You can now do all your reporting through XYZ." This like really low-level employee. Not in a condescending way. That's just who it was in the org chart. And I'm like, "Wow, dude, that's going to cost you a lot of money because people just think that that's what they're supposed to do." And it's like, do you really think that your business is at a point where you just take your foot off the gas and you just start delegating to people that don't have nearly the amount of competency of you and you don't have the infrastructure? Yeah. So, real real. We'll end with that. We got real today. We went deep. Thank you for hosting us today as well. We went extra extra and I'm sorry for that. But this was good. This was good. This was good. We've been waiting to do this one. We were going to do one of these versions, but this version's even better. Let's do more. But we'll close it out. We both have to speak tomorrow early. Yeah, we do. What time? I don't even know what time that is. You guys rock. I said I was done doing videos, but I said I was doing done doing daily videos. So, peace. Peace. Holy [ __ ]

# Info/Coaching + Theme Pages = Cash Flow w/ Nick Rogers | EP118
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YghRdmMmNs

What's up, guys? We are on day 118 in a row. Can't believe I'm even saying that. And we've got Nick Rogers. I vetted him because you guys [ __ ] on me for not vetting people before. So, he sent me this. I feel so bad. I have to ask for like, "Hey, can you send me all your stats?" But he sent me all stats. Then I incorrectly had thought his last name was GRS, but now we're here. So, Nick, kick it off. Who are you? Oh, that happens a lot with my last name because my handle is like an abbreviation for it and people think it's the uh well, I don't want to get you demonetized here on YouTube, but they think it's the nword. Um, so anyway, yeah, I uh I guess I'll start with what I do now and then maybe work back a little bit on the story just to give you full context. So, what I do dayto-day right now is I have a theme page network on IG. We did 276 million views last month. We're already at 102 105 so far this month. Um, mostly like business niche network. So that's number one. Second, we have a I have a consulting company where we help people start their social media specifically personal brands. And then the people that kind of graduate that I kind of pick off and I take equity of them or I take rev share of them and I scale them up uh much bigger. So those are the three things I do today and they all kind of work together. Because a lot of those people that we take on as basically our own brand, our own equity, we can pump through the pages. So we can take all that traffic and and the network that is the pages and we can push that traffic towards those brands, towards those people and grow them in that manner. So it's all very very cohesive uh and work together. Now there we go. He's back. He's having fun internet issues. So we're just going to have fun in this one. You're good. You're good. So yeah. No. So, where it left off for me and I don't know and apparently I'm also exiving this which is hilarious. So, um really? Yeah. So, okay. So, explain to me the page portion of it first. I want to like understand the front front to back because I I I kind of understand what you're saying how they all kind together. But, so just the page portion. So, when I started I was trying drop shipping. I was trying I the typical you know you take a you take a product from China AliExpress you're like this this might be good. And it never was for me you was always pretty shitty. Um, but I was spending all this money on Instagram pages to promote the products. And so I kept looking at this and I'm 19 at the time and I'm like, "Oh, smart, you know, why don't I just start my own pages?" And so I started to dabble in that and I started posting business news and it just popped. It was kind of one of the first businessy theme pages. Like the motivation niche existed, but the business niche didn't really exist yet. So, if you're familiar with pages like Wealth, I knew Wealth when he had 10K followers, you know, I saw him grow from zero um or 10K, but I was I was kind of in that in that niche. And from there, I just started growing growing growing and people came to me and said, "Hey, like I want your help growing my page." And that's how the agency piece started. And I ended up instead of like I used the pages to sell some info, do some affiliate, I sold a lot of advertising on there, which is shoutouts, you know, to grow people organically and that whole thing, grow their audience. But really what I started to do was leverage them to grow clients. So I would sign clients and I would use all these followers I have and I would shout them out. So let's say we have a real estate guy. Hey, such and such did XYZ, he owns, you know, 100 million worth of real estate, blah blah blah, the whole thing. you should go follow him. We'd have a real estate guy, we'd have a trading niche, we'd have all sorts of, you know, Amazon FBA, ecom, all sorts of niches. And you're doing this all from the same page or you're doing multiple pages at this point? Uh, that was multiple at that point. And then we used to buy a lot of shoutouts, like a lot of shoutouts from from other pages. And I don't know, would you consider that paid? Would you consider that organic? How would you what would you consider that? That's how Yeah. I mean, we've never really played that game. That It's funny you say this because to one, this was my initial intro into internet marketing. I had like no idea about any of this. And I was probably I was 19. I was 18 or 19. I think I was 18. Um, no, I was 19. But uh I bought a course um that was $497 that was Instagram whatever internet money type literally. I'm pretty sure that's its name. And you were basically paying for shoutouts, sending them to link in bio. You didn't even have your own page. So, you weren't building your own asset there, but you were sending them to a page that was an opt-in and then you had the thank you page as a redirect to a ClickBank offer. So, like to try and self-quidate, build an email list and then just mail your list and then make money from affiliate offers like content content content affiliate offer content content. So, like that was how I learned about it. So, in that capacity to my understanding, like I would put that as paid, but where you're doing it to grow pages, that's like that's like a hybrid, right? because now you have the organic following. It's in your asset, not paying for it, but it's really to grow the following. Yeah. And uh I want to expand on that point actually because I think there's something interesting because you have you have a lot of guys on here that do paid. Yes. I think they all right. Pretty much like all you guys uh Yeah. Like Ahmed was on here. Uh he's the one that sticks out in my head as someone who like really leans into organic. His whole like black swan approach where all of his clients are generally speaking doing YouTube long form. And there's a couple, but like yeah, I mean I hang out with a lot of the guys who do uh paid and then all the guys in the Iman crew and whatever that I hang out with over there are almost all organic. So it's like that's kind of the dichotomy. Got it. My thought process and I've pulled from a lot of different people, you know? I've seen I've seen how a lot of the really really like advertising heavy paid guys run things and I'm like I don't know if that's me because I don't know. I look at it, I'm like, [ __ ] like the the overhead of those ads, you know, something breaks. And I see you talk about it too on on the channel sometimes. Yeah. Where it's like, [ __ ] we're kind of negative here. And I'm like, I don't know if I want to be in that position. I really like the coziness of the organic. But I I've seen, you know, I've seen the really heavy paid guys. I've seen the really heavy organic guys. I've seen a lot of the guys that do the hybrid. And the the way I've kind of expanded on it from the pages is the pages were like an unfair advantage. I had those. I use those to grow clients, to grow myself, grow grow the audience, grow the brand. And then we would start to run organic or not organic, sorry, retargeting ads that retargeted the followers with basically a CTA, aka a direct response ad that says, "Hey, buy my shit." And my process now is more more so mimicking the organic. So, if we get a a a piece of content that just bangs in the algorithm, we'll put money behind it. So it grows the audience more. And then we'll have another ad that takes that audience and nurtures them. So we'll have a lot of this middle of funnel content that just targets only the followers and it nurtures them and it makes them say, "Holy [ __ ] like I really like this guy, you know, I see I see all his stuff. He can really help me." And then the people that watch, you know, a certain percent of that will then get retargeted with the direct CTA, the the direct response ad. Um yeah, Jeremy Haynes used to have something about Uh it was called I think he called it the Venus fly trap. His is like almost all paid or at least and Jeremy don't hate me but I think it is mainly all paid but he uh he used to do it where it was basically like you're moving someone through a funnel like almost of awareness. So it would start with paid XYZ and then it's like once they saw this ad they would show them to this. So similar to what you're saying except your initial step is organic and then you move them through the funnel steps like almost forced through paid because you can target then obviously that's the other benefit of paid is like very specific targeting. Um but that's super interesting. So, you're building so you're building these pages back up and you have multiple clients, multiple niche pages. Did you ever think like I I don't know what happens with these pages. I know two guys like that are actually pretty local to me. Um, and I need to connect with those guys again because I like feel like I talk about them all the time, but like they were mobbing with this. They were creating a ton of organic pages. I think they were flipping them. They got into like handles at one point. You know, everyone in that world knows each other and they were doing these massive pages. I don't know what they ended up doing or like monetization wise, but like last I heard they're crushing it. So, like shout out them. But um do you build up the pages to want to sell them? You strictly use them as advertising and then you can swap out the offers and different clients like what's I've I've thought about the the selling part of it a lot. They are pa pages are such a headache to uh manage. [ __ ] Did I did I You're keep it reconnecting. Um, pages pages are such a headache to manage sometimes because I think every page I've ever had got banned at least once. And so, so you just have to have a rep at IG, Facebook that that just can get you and they're pretty common. So, like that's not a huge deal, but you got to pay every time. It's annoying. I have one page that's been down for like 6 months at this point, you know, 400k followers just down. Uh, you know, just stuff like that. They're always just getting banned. Um, my thought process is I would like to sell them. I think I've I've spoken to some people that do buy and sell businesses and like they exist in that world. It's not my world per se, but they they think that the strongest path to do that is to make most of the income from ads and to have a specific product that is only existing on that page, which would be basically a separate infounnel that only exists on those pages. And I have 19 20 I have 20 pages now actually. and that that's kind of like the sale aspect of things. Uh I don't think that's what I want to do necessarily right now. Lost you again. How about now? How about now? I'm right next to the router. There we go. We're back. I'm on top of the router. out. I'm I'm getting cooked by the Wi-Fi. Um I I apologize. So, you're good. You're good. Keep going. To finish answering your question, um this the sale is something that I eventually probably want to do cuz I don't envision me running theme pages forever. You know, I started at 19. I'm 26 now. I don't really touch them on a dayto-day. The team touches them. But I don't want to be 40 being like, I own a bunch of pages. You know, it's media lever. It's Yeah, exactly. I mean like if you have a team if yeah you have an asset I mean it's an asset class at some level right it's like I have this grouping of pages but I mean I guess I get the the optics of it but cuz so so what so you take them all and then the bigger thing you were saying there that I picked up on in between was the you take like consulting for equity you take consulting for revshare or you take client like service work for revshare or equity like what do those deals look like so because now you have based on what I understand so far and like sorry about a little bit of choppy so I'm trying to okay so we have the we have all the pages You also do some level of paid and then you plug into other info coaching generally clients some ecom maybe or no so no no ecom I don't touch ecom only info done a tiny bit of like software but it's kind of like almost bizoppy info a little bit that's just kind of the world I live in and I understand it and I yeah and not to go out of it I think you can probably relate to that I I don't know but I um yeah I say I'm like I'm staying in info coaching like I'm I'm good where I'm at. Like everyone tries to go pages are attractive on those. I mean, Jesus Christ. I think that within info coaching, you can go so much deeper. Oh, you're good. You're good. I think you can just go so much deeper in info coaching. I think like staying within that lane, like there's just so much cash flow. There's so much upside. Like it's not really like a private equity game where it's like, oh, I have a, you know, I have 50 equity holdings and these different things. But like the rev share agreement makes a lot of sense. Profit share agreements make a lot of sense. Scale agreements make a lot of sense. So, did I lose you again? You're good. Yes, live live stream videos are a little different. No doubt. No doubt. No, we're good. Again, dude, these are raw every single day. Law, like complete raw edit cuts, me meeting people. This is not like, oh, let's polish it and who is whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What do you think about the different monetization models? Because that's what I was trying to say and I think we cut out on it. Did we cut out again? Is maybe maybe this is like bad ju guu. Maybe I shouldn't be saying these things out loud because every time I say them, you cut out and we wait again. I hope you guys enjoy our media break sponsored by I think that's Mountain Valley Water. different monetization models. I just said this was sponsored by Mountain Valley, so hopefully they send me like 100 grand. So, um, yeah. So, monetization model wise, you said, what do you think about this for info coaching? cuz you just said equity and like I don't challenge people on here because I don't really have strong beliefs times but like equity and info coaching is so not like really a thing right like it is cool but like you have risk now you have a 0.001% 's 01% likelihood of selling. So like what's the upside versus what likely is higher as revshare or more in alignment which is profit share I guess but like I hear all the different types of them. I like revshare. I think consulting for revshare in info coaching is like like that's the hitter in my mind is not necessarily as fair depending on what kind of service delivery you have what kind of whatever. So maybe more profit share is more in alignment, but like as the person doing it, like if I was to do it tomorrow, like rev share makes sense to me because I know that I can't control the profit in the same way I can as if I'm in the operator role. So it's like that's literally it. Oh, now we're going to use this as our sponsor break by Zen. You don't think net net makes sense? You're getting so frustrated. Oh god, this is good. We're good. You're good. Roll with it. Uhhuh. Yeah. 100%. 100%. Yeah, I know a lot of those guys that do. Someone just asked in the comments, what's the difference? Cuz I literally accidentally went live on X with this. It was hilarious. So, it's actually live right now. um difference between revshare and equity and info. Revshare topline or what he's saying in there gross. So taking all the cash collected minus what you spend in ads and potentially sales team cost whatever basically to acquire it and then it's paid off that amount. Rev would be off the total top equity or net bigger issue is it's like full profit share. So, what Nick's saying is like these guys will have a marketing expense of a Lamborghini and technically the net will be like $10,000 instead of $350,000 and then you won't get paid as a proper percentage. What Yeah. No, that is absolutely ridiculous. So, what is your like client stack right now? You're doing 10 clients, you're doing 50 clients, you're doing two clients. Do you try and go big with size or is that kind of capped with what you can do in terms of organic paid with these pushes of these pages? Like, could you take one of them to five million? It's like 12 questions, but Yeah. I think high ticket start. Yeah, high ticket starts at like three to five depending in my book. Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah. I love that model. I love that model. If you're if you're good people and you have good [ __ ] I love that model. The guys who like Yeah, it's the math makes sense. The model makes sense, the cherry pick, like the, you know, cream rises, you get paid to do the whole thing, so you still get paid for your time without having to only do the cherry pick where it's only like I like the dance of having those two in one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I could talk to you I could talk to you the next 40 minutes about this. I only get to talk to I I only get to talk to a couple people about this. So my initial and like what the market initial is like terrible idea, doesn't work, won't work, a lot of wasted time, a lot of whatever, right? is like the initial and I am in the camp of like building one of those right now and in that direction that like half the time I'm like is this stupid because we sacrifice all the cash flow and all these if you're doing it in like some version of what is like the right way in terms of like how you're building the team how you're building the diversification how you're having to test things and like burn cash how you're having to machine it how you're having to remove founder comp plans W2 like depending like you start stacking all those together and your margin can go like this depending and like Then if you go out of certain scales and like you you know the contribution overhead finally you know overtakes the overhead at whatever size like I was talking a lot of videos ours is at a like a million and a half let's say and that's like technically with spending x amount on ads in order to make it so we can fill calendars so it's like not overhead but like is kind of like cost of doing business for us because we're so paid heavy so blah blah blah but like I don't know I know a guy that is doing this that's not public about it but he's doing this kind they're calling them education companies which I also have a beef with a little bit on what the difference is between info coaching and education and there is overlap but like info coaching is like the method in which you fulfill more or less education is like what you're selling kind of right and they're like a little different there and the whole thing with education is education isn't recurring unless it's structured properly to be recurring because no one pays for college for life for what they learned one time in it Right. And you hear Iman and Dan Henry had a good video about this where they talked about it. But like I know a guy who's basically grouping these together. And I think I lost you on this, but I'm just going to yap because we'll upload this after. But I know a guy who is trying to group these together. He's trying to find 5, 10, 15 of these exactly like what you said. Group them into a holding co. Cash flow the [ __ ] out of them. And then like literally he's trying to do like a take it public in like a foreign Oh my goodness. We are solo, ladies and gentlemen. This is a rough one. I apologize. I'm just going to talk about it. But I know somebody who is essentially doing that, trying to take it public in XYZ market and then trying to move it over to like the New York like just crazy talk. Something that like I'm not even familiar with. But the economics on it just don't fully make sense to me. Um because again, most of the time you have these I just yapped the whole time. So you're good. The general gist of it was I know somebody who's trying to do this, who's trying to pair a bunch of them together, cash flow the [ __ ] out of them, have them as solid education businesses, and then literally try and take it public on like an XYZ exchange, and then once it's Yeah. Right. Like crazy [ __ ] And then once it's over there in like a foreign market, then build it up from public cash, then take it over here and like do all this stuff. But like, so that's someone who's trying to do it like over here. Then you have the guys that are like in the middle that are kind of trying to do that where it's like holding co-private equity. I had Cole Gordon on. He talked about it where it's like he almost like doesn't want to do that game anymore because he's like build upward build go deep in one thing. He did it with whatever five companies 7 million a month and the profit on it was basically the same as when he was running one standard. So I don't know. I mean I don't know that it's a perfect fit necessarily for info coaching. Um, it's a lot harder with info coaching, I think, to have them where they're actually exitable and then the diversification like through holding and through multiple of them. They all need a standalone at some level unless there's like cuz like when you have these things and like when people like roll up laundry mats like they have all the same like economics and like the business models may be the same, but like unless they all stand alone in that, I don't know. I haven't gone down that road, but like I just yapped a bunch and I'm sure you didn't hear a bunch of it, but like I'm interested to hear your perspective on it though. I agree it's difficult. So like my perspective is I have multiple assets and my my own personal info coaching, you know, can stand alone on its own. And like let's say let's say I eventually want to remove myself from that and sell it which we're in the process of because we're starting to acquire a lot of customers just on the business name launch socials rather than my own personal name. Um I have that I have the pages and then I have the agency thing which I I ran for years. It's really good cash flow and then if it could potentially be be plugged in on a holding co structure I wouldn't hate it. But I'm not married to like the fact of this is my one thing. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to go all in. I'm gonna I'm gonna have to do it this way. It doesn't necessarily have to pan out that way where it sells for me to be successful. So, I think it's worth the risk of trying it cuz I was doing that stuff anyway. Yeah. So, I think we're talking about the same person on or I know who you're talking about more so when you're saying the guy who's growing them and who sold his and did all that, but who else do you know that's done this? I heard so and I'm going to Jeremy Haynes event this weekend and he was talking about how he knew someone or a client of his sold for like minority chunk of it for 20 mil and like all this stuff. the ones that stand out and who was on here that talked about selling um Will Brown and then the other one that talked about sell or that has sold is Hormosi and like who else right like I don't know directly off the top and like even you know Iman talks about it like digital launchpad that he has he's like oh we built it as this thing that could like exit essentially that was non-relyant on him multiple faces inside the product multiple faces and IP they can use for front like all this stuff and even he's like yeah that thing can't sell because it's still too reliant on me. Yeah. And it's like there's not many. And and so for me, that's always like a it's like a I'm doing this and it could be something that I wrap up maybe, but it's not something that I'm married to. And and and I think that's the only way you can approach it because it is so few and far between that people sell these things. You're good. Oh, okay. I thought I thought I cut out for a second. I I I haven't I haven't really heard of anybody that that sold anything. I've seen offers. I've seen I've seen a lot of offers because I've been on a lot of I've been on a lot of offers and I've seen a lot of offers from people maybe to come in to buy something. And then a lot of times I'll also say I think a lot of times people will go to buy some of these companies and then yeah pe people go to buy some of these companies and then they'll do due diligence on it and they're like oh my god it's so [ __ ] up. Like it's the back end because a lot of the people running these offers don't know what they're doing. I audited this this company the other day. They're doing 500 a month and they don't have any tracking. They don't know where their leads come from. They they were making most of their money from organic after I audited it, but they're spending like almost six figures a month in paid. Just like all over the map, and the paid was basically going 100% to waste. Um, a lot of a lot of these offers are just like not in good shape. They're not real companies. They're just kind of thrown together pieces of things and the operators on them are kind of non-existent. So, I think that's one of the reasons a lot of these things can't sell. And then secondarily, they get audited. Like people might be interested. It's like, "Wow, look at that cash flow." And then they get audited and it's like I might have lost you on this, but this this isn't good. Come back. You're good. There you go. Um, so on the what do you think of like offer stack? Like what's your what's your honeypot? I heard you say a trading offer in there. You obviously you said some bisop ones, but like do you generally do stuff that's more MR focused? Do you do stuff that's more high ticket, mid-t like direct to cart like for the clients? Yeah. So really just high ticket. I mean what what you consider high ticket? I know you said three to five. Um which is commonly high ticket in the space. Basically anything you have to sell over the phone I consider high ticket. I know there's like high ticket ecom and physical product but like info wise if you have to sell it over the phone I just I'm like oh it's high ticket. I I sell mostly high ticket. I like MRR. the trading company that sold was MR and I think that's one of the reasons that it did sell because of that consistent recurring. Um I think that everyone this is my personal opinion on people starting everyone should start with high ticket like the velocity of cash flow on it. You have to sell how many courses do you have to sell to make 10K if the course is 100 bucks or 500 bucks a lot. How many you know info coaching do you have to sell to make 10k if it's 5k two or split pay whatever it's like three or four you just make so much more money so much faster and you can do it with a thousand followers and then you build the offer stack out from there so eventually people are going to graduate I like to have a graduation usually on the offers of like you hit this like you've completed it and then they graduate and then it's like oh logically I can offer them this next thing and then you build out the upsell and then as your audience grows and you you get a lot more people that just aren't a fit for it. You can build out the lower ticket, whether that's MR, you can build out, you know, a low ticket course, stuff like that. That's typically how I run it. So, a lot of people never even get to that stage where they need it. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, I think high ticket to start. I also think that doing it through the beauty you have then with that like just inherently is then that people are getting on the phone. So, you have the opportunity to like massage the conversation, learn from it, get feedback. So like you have versus sending them to a sales page is like how's the copy on the page? How's the video on the page? Like you do all this production, you spend all this time trying to like launch an offer with a sales page and like if it doesn't hit, you just burn the cash or you burn the clicks from organic or whatever. And it's like, you know, not as much with organic, but like still it's versus you get someone on the phone, it's like you can maybe come up with different offerings. You can mess with pricing. You can understand maybe they have different like pain points and you want to change what the offer is over the first five or 10 calls. You have the opportunity to do that. And then exactly with the cash flow, but that thing around MR you said is huge. Like we just two a month and a half, two months ago launched like a mid ticket I guess you'd call it. Uh continuity that's MR on the back. So we still sell like one to one over the phone high ticket. That's that they can continue on with that if they want after year one for as many years as they want. But and if they're going to leave because they don't want onetoone personalization, all the stuff it's like, oh, we have this other thing that's basically group coaching model. So it's you get access to everything. You just don't have the onetoone with your coach and it's like half the cost. So it's like okay cool you build this MR engine on the back is that after the year is up. Cool. So it's like a downell continuity. So we try and keep them in the main thing but it's like if we're churning call it 50%. It's like can we recapture 10 20 30% of those into something that's half the price where they still get a lot like you know same result different implementation or different like handholding. Um, and it's also like if you frame it correctly for us, it's almost like a graduation cuz it's like you learned how to do XYZ because there's kind of an education component that comes with the coaching. So it's like once they learn kind of the frameworks and the how we want to do things, then after that they might not need the access to the coach as frequent, but they still want to stay on for access to the app and the community and the this and this and this. So I don't know. We're kind of b bouncing back and forth on like should we push more people into that? It has a higher margin percentage but a lower do uh lower dollars. It's like it costs whatever to pay a coach for one to one to year. It costs this much to pay a coach for, you know, group coaching in like per unit, but the dollars are more on the one to one, right? Cuz let's say it's, you know, 10 grand versus five grand. So like the the margin is higher, but do we want to build up this? Cuz like technically we have recurring revenue through the 1:1 coaching. Like technically we do, but like knowing your numbers on it, what's the retention rate? What's the actual like on an annual basis? You're saying on an annual basis. Yeah. So it's like uh so like right now we're doing a revenue generating event internal to coin Iman's phrase revenue generating event. We do ours internal. So we'll do like renewal special that's 500 or 1,000 bucks off or whatever for the year and it's like a one week thing. It's like hammer the list coaches hit your hit your client rosters do this whole thing. Margin still 80% or whatever because there's no advertising cost there's no sales cost. There's no whatever. It's just like a renewal. It's just the fulfillment cost. And so we'll hammer that. So like yesterday we did like 290. Today we're at like 175 like just ripping and ripping doing those. But like it's a oneweek period and then we so we're trying to like bake an evergreen in and then have like two revenue generating events that are internal only that are like renewal only. So it's big engine on the front that's diversified so that it could sell one day where it's multiple faces, multiple funnels, whatever cost and alignment. They play together. They do their thing. You get the client. They sit in this onetoone coaching thing that has obviously a lesser margin because it has the cost to acquire the customer. It has the sales rep. It has the fulfillment. It has all the things. X contribution overhead exists. And then after year one is like, do you want to stay or in these two revenue generating events, do you want to add a year or two years for a slight discount because the margin's still great? or at the end of your term in an evergreen setting, do you want to downell continuity into this other program that's like you don't need a onetoone coach anymore, but you want to stay is like the current frame. Really interesting. I um it's it's interesting. I think the the most interesting point that you made is like technically we have recurring, but what's how many Yeah. Yeah. It's not a huge thing. Yeah. churn goes crazy on stuff like this. What What is your churn number on that? Do you know? So high. Yes, I know. And I refuse to It's high. Like we had we had an issue with like how we were doing payment collection. We were letting them check out with their own external financing when they wanted to. And we hit it pretty hard last year. So we had a bunch of people that were selecting like payment terms that were different than what the term length was. So like example, someone clicked 18 or 24month financing for a 12-month program. So like the you know churn on those are high. But now that we've put we didn't have we have you know a retention team now that's basically sales reps that we didn't have prior like once we've implemented all these things it's like 20 30 40 50 like are staying now and then now you include these renewal numbers and it's like 50 60 like so it's getting up there but like it was [ __ ] for a long time like you know we bas if you just do net net it's like 50% call it we have like you know x amount of thousands of clients right now and then we have call it 10,000 or whatever that are that have come through on that specific offering we have. Yeah. So, blah blah blah. But like it's getting way better. And then if you bl you blend all these numbers, but I'm interested for so to kind of get off that a little, but for sales and I don't know if I just lost you. I think I did. Someone asked this question. I think it's a good question because I have a very strong belief on it. Should be throwing anothers in. Are you back? Are you back? Yeah. Yeah, I'm back. I have Go for it. Yeah. Go ahead. No, go for it. You had some. Oh, I was gonna say, so someone asked on here sales-wise, and I have a very interesting like belief on this, but what is your because someone asked, do you have sales team in place for your high ticket offers, Nick? So, if you have multiple of these, you have multiple sales managers, sales sales teams, like how do you do that? Of course. So, the way the way we like to run it, like, of course, we always have sales teams in place. Usually, it's setters, closers. Um, we we we the way the way we la Okay, so it because there's multiple layers, right? That's why I'm I'm trying to figure out which one to attack first. So like the guys that we launch, the founder is selling it. I'm like, dude, you don't they try everyone tries to hire a salesperson and I'm like, dude, you don't even know what the offer is yet. Like you need to go in, you need to sell it. And kind of to your point earlier, take those 10, 15, 20 calls. I say get 10 20 sales first and then fulfill those people just to get the feedback from them to know what the offer should be. You then take all that information and data. You relaunch it fully like what I would call a hard launch. It's like I consider those first 20 sales like a soft launch. Yeah. You know, get those deals from DMs, get scrappy, get those people in, get the feedback, get the data. Then you hard launch it with like hard CTAs, retargeting ads, the full thing. You put the full system together. you still take the calls once it's working from there. Like I don't know why I'm a fan. I'm a fan. I know so many people would not who would not do that. So like that's why I'm kind of like laughing but like I'm I'm completely in alignment. Got it. You guys like anyone starting an offer has to take the calls because you're just you don't have any visibility if you don't and then the sales guy isn't recording. You don't know what his experience is. He's on five different offers. He's all over the place. Your offer isn't enticing yet because it's not making enough money. You have to take the calls first. You get all that feedback, all that data. You know how it works. You hard launch it. You get enough volume there where you can put one closer into place and one setter into place and you build from there. And then once you have a few closers, a few setters, you put a sales manager into place. So that's the system I run for every offer, whether it's starting all the way to big offer doing 500 a month, mill a month, whatever. We're mostly like at at the top end. we're in like 500ish range on average. Uh I have another point on that as well I want to touch on, but um so so it scales, right? It really depends on the stage someone's at, but we always aim to build a sales team. Like we always want to remove the main person that that's the face of everything from everything except for like a fulfillment touch point usually and all the front end, right? They we just want them to be the face, you know? If we can get them to that position, of course, we want to have a sales team. An interesting point. I have two points actually cuz I cut out on the recurring. Something we've been testing is a a high ticket front end like a five six whatever on the front end and then like a 200 or a 400 a month for the entire year. So on the front end on that purchase we get the we get the big payment and then we build recurring into the first year. I'm not saying it works. I'm not saying it works. I don't know. I'm testing it as we speak right now. Um, but we've had a few sales on it. Like people aren't Of course I lost you on the good part. No. Right. There you go. I got you back. Yeah. So, the two people the two people I know that do this that crush with it. Onyx and Gal does this when we were at his, that's how he pitched his. So, it's like an upfront join fee and then it drops into monthly. And then same with uh one of the best masterminds that I'm in that we literally don't even use really anymore, but we're in Ezra Firestone's Blue Ribbon Mastermind. So, ecom whatever. and he's just live showing him building and scaling massive businesses. Um, and his is like that. It was like I don't even know what the number is. It was 5K or 10K or whatever up front and then like 1,200 or 1,500 a month. I think it works a lot for the ones where it's like really community- based and like stay in. I don't know how. And like the for like you're in it forever, right? It's the lifer mastermind model more so than the educationbased or like you know one-year term contract fulfillment which frankly is like what ours is kind of, right? It's like we have all these our client wins channel just fire off and it's like they're doing such a good job of fulfilling on the contract for the year. It just wasn't really framed up until like 3 to four months ago in a way that's like this is a forever thing and we didn't have the other offers and we didn't have the other like you know so I mean I agree. Uh what are you what are you selling that works for monthly and is it for the rest of the term or is it like indefinitely framed? We we're just testing an adjustment to the pitch where it is a big upfront fee and then we just add in the monthly fee and seeing if it takes and it's taking a little bit. Uh it's somewhat working. I lost you. This [ __ ] [ __ ] Sorry guys, we having mad technical difficulties with this, but I think Here we go. You're good. I I I just want to apologize to you, dude. You don't Why? Well, cuz cuz come on, man. I got to have my [ __ ] together here. Although I am You're good. I am three feet from the router. You're good. You're good. No, I am the most No, I am the most chill in the world about this stuff. I don't This is all good. So So what were we saying? So you the how you changed the pitch is what I last heard. Dude, we just pitched a different price. Like we didn't change anything on the pitch except we're testing a different price of like Yeah, it's this plus this monthly and and we're not getting many nos. Um how do you see the actual like LTV of it change though? Or like what's the time time to churn or cuz that's the thing that I'm like okay cool if we just threw it in. It was like the startup thing and then this. Well, because that's an interesting thought though. I mean, I'm kind of thinking about that. That's like because we have like so much organic like it's mainly 90% organic that we acquire customers from. There's very very little churn like ever. Like our payment plan collections the price on the what is like a monthly example or what's a pitch example? So, it's 2K up front and then like 300 a month or like five and then two or or four and then five. Uh we've been playing with it just a little bit. Uh I don't know if I'll keep it, but it's it's just something to test. I lost you again. You're back. You're good. Yeah. Interesting. So for us, I know that's like a very interesting model because I'm like so I'm trying we're going to try to achieve that but not through we're trying to do it through additional offerings. So like same way that somebody would do 5K upfront with a to get like the info education portal and then once they're in there there's a $200 a month software they use for trading or for to find suppliers for drop shipping or whatever, right? So it's like you pair two offers together, not price one offer in two ways. So like we're trying we're going to try and play that game with like what else do they buy, right? So it's like supplements. Is it this? Is it that? Um so there's like two monetization methods but two different pricing models or price or whatever monetization types. Um so that's like a but that's a very interesting frame cuz I know that crushes for masterminds. I know it crushes for masterminds. I just wonder how if we could even make that work for the front layer of info coaching. I'm not sure. That's why we're testing it. We're gonna find out. So, okay. Now, around the sales team. So, my strong belief, and I'm curious on yours, so you're building sales teams in-house. Yes. Come on, man. It's the life we live. Um, so with you're building them in-house, but like my belief on this and how it shifted over now this range is like I believe in sales agencies, which I never had one. I never used one. I tried to use one for $1099 like management, but we never used one that was full- encompassing. Now there's these guys who like crush it that do like 20% rips and they handle the whole thing which obviously is a little more expensive than if you run in house cuz you let's say you run at 10%, you have setters you have three whatever 3 to 5% so you're at 15 maybe have a manager you're at 17 like you can save for sure by going direct but I am under the impression that the headcount equals the headache and it becomes a massive issue over time. when you're trying to scale, it becomes the biggest headache versus why not just worry about marketing more inflow. Why not just worry about ascension and retention and product and just like get rid of the sales team? Because all these info coaching, cash flow businesses run so lean. It's all about cash flow. It's all about this like to then manage two, five, 10 closers and potentially then two, five, 10 setters is like a whole new you you introduce like managing of people which doesn't really exist in info coaching at like the small or medium scale. Yep. So, I've worked with tons of agencies, lots of them. I think some sales agencies are really good. I think some are not so good. It's hit or miss. Like, you know how it is. It's the agency game. I only have two guys. I only have two guys I recommend. For context, yeah, it's it's the agency game in general. Um, and I have a few guys I recommend. Of course, I I probably have a control issue. I like I like to have the the control like in house of you know we I'm it's also I know every part of the process because this is just my game. So I in a sense am a sales agency if that makes sense. Yeah. When I manage other offers. Yeah that makes sense. So so it's like I'm just going to do it for for these offers. Um that's that that's my take on it. But yeah, agencies in general, like there's there's some agencies out there that can do it better than you can or I can or anybody watching can, but there's super few and far between. And how much cash and time do you burn trying to find that agency and a lot of times it's a lot. I mean, I've I've been there. So, yeah, we did that with marketing and just burned it. Like just dumbass burned it. Like we just didn't want to worry about marketing, which is the stupidest thing. But for a minute, it was like just like such a headache. We're like, "Oh, we'll just use this agency. We're getting good results. We're like, cool." Agency kind of started to flip, like falter a little. So, we moved to another agency that had all these big promises and experience and we're like, "Oh, we're good." And just boom, next thing you know, we're spending 130 grand a month or whatever to an agency. CPA is rising at the same time, like both those in tandem, and it was like not good. But yeah, I don't know. I think I think the sales thing's big. So, you just said something interesting and like I don't you don't have to dox your numbers by any means, but how do you view your monetization model? Like how does the math work? Cuz like you know a sales agency like I said a lot of the time will take 20, some take 25. I've heard some take less than 20 but most are around 20. They staff everyone. You're doing essentially the management portion but like you said it's kind of built into the into the model already where acquisition you know sales cost will be in there. What you can give ranges, but like what is like someone who runs your model? Ahmed was on here and talked to his number like rough because he does a similar thing. He basically like growth operates the wrong word, but he kind of does like a toz management of these entire offers and he'll be like and he gets a rev share rep is how he does it because there's no uh ad cost really because it's almost all organic. So it's basically the same probably as yours. But I've heard people can get 20. I've heard people get 40. I've heard like when they're really really hands-on. I heard guys that just kind of like co-o and do 10. Like I'm usually the 15 to 25% range, but I also do it on purpose. Like I think I could probably push it up to 30 to to 40. But do I want to have that level of responsibility on multiple different businesses and I don't cuz then you know there's a bad profit month, you know, something bad happens, something breaks, they're coming to you as a source of funds. Hey, you got to cover that negative. You know, I don't want to deal with that. So yeah, I I like a balance of I'm I'm getting compensated, you know, on a level that I deem fair. You cut again. I'm You're back. You're good. You're good. Yeah. No, you I mean, dude, so I have talked to many people on this cuz like this was kind of like a version and like still is cooking of like maybe where my land can live cuz I like I'm not going to sell anything like direct. performance in my mind is completely different like performance based anything. So like no fe like so how do you draw the line on what you're willing to service and not because like what you just said there is like oh if I took 40% I feel like I would have more responsibility or I would have you know capital calls or I'd have whatever like how do you clearly define the line as okay cool we're going to take 25% but like the buck stops here on where you're willing to do service delivery or help or whatever. coffee break. I have like four stems going at the same right time right now, guys. So, you're back. You're good. So, how do you how do you how do you view where you draw the line in the sand in terms of that? To me, to me, the best way to do it is have an abundance of the lead flow where I I don't have to just work with someone because the money is right. I I can work with them because I like them and I know they're a solid person and I know they're they're going to pay on time and I know they're going to be cool to work with and they're not going to bring in extra headaches. And for me, I guess I think the line you were asking about maybe outside of that is like the dollar amount and or the percent. For me, it's this is probably worth it. I would pay it if I own the business, but also I'm not taking on too much risk or or too much responsibility. And it's kind of that mix. And I find 15 to 25 is good for that. And I can come in and do a lot of hands-on stuff and then I can slowly move towards consulting, which is less hands-on and a lot less of like my time involved. Yeah, that's kind of how I'm viewing it, too. I mean like you hear guys who are investors and like of true like actual capital not just time and they will draw the line in the sand like no I'm I'm strictly a financial partner I'm strictly a this so I just think it's so much it's just so difficult to draw the line in the sand on where you want to do it with consulting where you want to do it with time where you want to do it with how much you want to dedicate to the offer but if you see the upside it's like all of a sudden you want to like 10x lean in and you're like oh this one could go to two or three million a month if I just put some more time in it and then it's like okay you want to you want to have the control like you said to be able to like cherrypick that and be like I want to lean in on this one you can keep your percent but like you choose to lean in versus like what is the minimum I think that's like the biggest piece for me on like how I look at it so yeah so you're are are you going to kind of turn your operation into like multiple of these and not just so core core biz is core biz that thing is going to go like the idea is that it almost grows beyond me so like I it's owner operate right now for Sure. Um but like even day by day like there's such a strong team. Like the biggest thing the issue we have right now is like such strong players almost like too many chefs in the kitchen or like not getting the efficiency out of team we have. So that's why you know you look at these like profit numbers or this overhead thing. And again this might be like a pipe dream for me even saying it and like I could just be wrong on this and in six months I'm like damn we burned millions of dollars on payroll and whatever. But like my belief is and you cut out I think so. Sorry. But my belief of it is more around the idea that if I can get the team efficiencies and the proper people in place kind of before that so like the seuite and then the proper players on the team and then get the operation operator piece handled to where they get the efficiencies out of that team. I think I just cut out there for you, but the the basically seuite just having a team of sickos, which is basically what we have right now. And right now the two biggest levers are getting efficiencies out of them and their teams. So like layering in operations and management for them and like helping them with that. So I just got a project manager last week that starts next week. I think it's going to be huge. And then the big lever is like deploying that within marketing because CPA is the biggest lever in terms of profit for us right now. Like by far by far. So, so, so I don't know if that answers the question, but essentially we're trying we're going to build main code to the point that it's I as an owner, not as an owner operator. And then my goal is to continue to stay within info coaching, connect with all these people, do all this stuff. And like there's so many like I get DMs that are like, "Oh, I'll pay 50 grand for consulting. I'll pay, you know, I'll give you x percentage of my company. I'll do I just deny everything right now." And it's like I want to partner with the right people and do the right stuff if that becomes, but like I also don't want it to be a distraction. So, right now my focus is main co and then I'm kind of cooking up side co thing that would be a partnership version of this. Um, but I'm not going to public announce anything until I'm like dead set sure on it. Hell yeah, man. That is awesome, bro. And uh I respect that actually leads into this next one on here. Someone asked in here and I'm curious on yours for saying no. What's the key to longevity in info game and does it essentially come down to looking at data and Oh, did I lose you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was just saying I was just saying I respect a lot the fact that you know you're you're sticking to the the main thing and saying no to the money in the DMs even though it's like super easy. Yeah. I just like don't want to one I just don't want to be that person. Two, the second I take 50 grand from someone if they don't make like you know 500 grand like I will not sleep at night and like I'm just that person and I don't like that. Everything I've always done is performance based. It's almost like a lack of confidence at some level or something, right? Where it's like these guys who can charge 50 grand are like, "Oh, my hour was worth it." And if they don't implement it, that's on them. Like, I'm just not there as like a person to where I feel comfortable doing that or like selling that. It's just not who I currently am or I'm okay with. So, I like the idea of performance based. I've always done performance based. I've always done that. And it's like if I help you and it gets XYZ, like I'm cool with you making 10 million, I make a million on it and like whatever type of arrangement or 5 million on it, you make 10 or whatever. Um, so yeah, that's been mine on it. But someone asked on here and I'm actually curious on this. So what's the key to longevity in info game? And does it essentially come down to looking at data and continuous optimization, which I think those are kind of like two different questions because I don't think it's a second one, but what's your what do you think the key to longevity in the info game is? Well, especially if it's a personal brand, it's being yourself. And this is what we help people. This is what I help people with every day. There are so many people that are just like, I'm going to do this thing for the camera. And I think eventually on like a spiritual level, it eats at your soul to do some [ __ ] that you don't really believe in or isn't you. And that's going to burn you out. And then secondarily, eventually you're going to [ __ ] somebody over if you're not acting out of the correct interests. And that that's it. like once once you only have the one reputation and people have gotten the reputations back, but it's not common. You know, it cooks people. So, so it's really just being authentically actually yourself and and not pretending to be somebody that you're not. And I think that happens a lot with the influencer, personal brand, you know, type of individual. Um, I also think the second thing which is just a standard business thing is cash flow is number one and don't outspend your cash flow to where you know you have to go into debt to to keep things running and stuff like that. Just basic business 101. Um, I think those are the two main things that I see at least. I'm curious what you see. Yeah, with info I have a hard hard stop in three, but uh in info it's I always say there's a difference between someone who's like they they always say like oh what offer are you on or what offer are you running and there's a big difference between offer and business and like you know those are just two words but like depending on how you look at them it is a very very large difference and there are the guys that are the personal brand dudes and it used to be forever in direct response it's like what's my new offer and constantly spinning up a new mechanism and a new mechanism and selling essentially the same thing with different Like there's truth to that in messaging and marketing, but there's not really truth to that in like your business model and like you're not building a business when you're just going offer to offer to offer unless you're building a machine that is offered to offer like you're doing, you know, an Agora or something. But like I don't know, I'm I'm under the belief that info will continue to change. The AI piece will continue to change, especially I think I already right now see a ton of stuff happening with like coaching being more so than info. um or info being used as a way to then sell coaching for the higher ticket stuff. Um but yeah, I mean I think longevity just exists like you said being good person being, you know, iterating on your product is different than jumping from offer to offer to offer. That's number one as well. Like I I don't know how I didn't think of that, but like I also kind of maybe tied that in with authenticity. If you're the guy that sells drop shipping one day and then you flip to now your theme pages and now you're agency and now you're crypto, now you're AI. Yeah. you know, your reputation is going to get cooked doing that. And second, you're never going to get the long-term client results that you could get to get the compounding effect to go really big. It just doesn't happen. Yeah. I know you got to go. Yeah. No, this was No, this was solid. I know we had obviously some issues. So, when you're out of the Smoky Mountains, we'll rip around, too, because now you clearly have a lot of perspective and you do it from a different angle than I do, which I like. Yeah, man. Uh, it was great and I appreciate you having me on and what you're doing is awesome and the YouTube is awesome and uh, we definitely I mean if you'll have me again I will I promise I promise the good Wi-Fi will be there. We'll run a proper call. Yeah, 100%. And I won't have a hard stop in an hour. I never have that. I usually do this at the tail end of the day, but someone booked in and I figured that would be helpful. I don't actually It's not even true. No one can book in. I don't have any calendar links. So cool, man. Y, we'll talk soon. Appreciate you. Take care. M I

# We Fixed This Funnel in 5 Minutes (Watch This) | EP117
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxSsi04eHRY

What's up, guys? We are back. Day 117, I believe, which is crazy. 117 days in a row. And we've got Josh Low ticket Gavin. I like the name on here. And we're going to be doing live funnel reviews. So, Josh has a great network. I pull or I push it out as well. We get some submissions in on a form. People are going to submit AOVs, CPAs, low ticket, different types of funnels, and then we just live review them. Sometimes nice, sometimes a little what do you what do you call that? Soup's another one. I love the comments of the last one. Go watch the last one. There's some funny funnels. It wasn't mean. It's just kind of funny. Yeah. No, none of this is mean. Just FYI to everyone. This is like us just being candid about what we see, what we think. And like also sometimes ugly things work better than pretty things. But when it comes to the offer, it comes to the flow, comes to the economics, like that's pretty that's pretty science-based. So let's kick it off, brother. Man, I think I think I have this live on X. So hopefully this is live on. Yeah, it's live. 22 viewers. Yeah, we got 24 viewers. Shout out. You guys have links, DM them. One thing I know some of you guys watching this replay or on live or whatever, I know there's a lot of you guys you'd love for us to review your funnels and you're like, "But I Josh, I don't want you to share like the links or whatever." Um, hey, if you would rather us not share the links, be okay showing the design of the offer, feel free to send it to us privately and let us know. We'll try to get you in on a future episode if we do another one. And we'll try to keep it private. So, uh, we totally understand that as well. But we have a couple funnels in here, uh, that we'll go through. Uh, again, I asked for as much data as possible, Ryan. Some people don't give it. Some people don't know. I think we had someone sign a client and they don't even access everything yet. We're reviewing their stuff, so they don't even know, but we're going to do the best we can here. But, let me pull up and share my screen. Let me know you can see it. Oh, yeah. Again, I'm nicotine. caffeinate. Heck yeah. Get lit. I can't see anything. Let's get lit. Oh, shoot. Why can't I share? Wait, I might need to reset and rejoin low key. No. Yeah, it's so quit and restart. No. No. Come on. Share. Let's see. I'm sorry, guys. At this point, I have nothing else to say other than Josh. He's the best MC at these possible up until this moment and now he's not the best MC. What do you guys think about doing these live like this? Are you chat? You're good. What's up? Now your audio is all I'm good now. I got it. Don't you worry. Don't you worry about it. Live is a move. We can just cut it up. Clearly. Yeah. Yeah. Super good. The one time The one time exactly we go live is when there's like an edit. All right. Does it let you do it now? Let me I'm trying to get my mic shifted over here. Is that better? Check. Check. Check. That's fine. Yeah, it sounds okay. Sounds crispy. Yeah, it sounds not using the right mic. It's not using the right mic. What the freak, dude? Why is All right, we'll just get into it. Sorry, guys. This is bad mic. You have to suffer through it. All righty. Let me share my screen again and we'll get into this. We got some funnels to review today. Um, let's see. Maybe got some We got some health ones. Maybe we'll just have bisop. What do you think, Ryan? I wonder if we'll have we'll have some here. Let it rip. All right. Can you see my screen now? Yes, we're good. All right. Now we're cooking. Now we're cooking. All right. So, first one up here, we have um Delta Funnels. Okay, let's see what here. So, we have their ad library. Let's see if that works. Uh, nope, they did not show the right link. So, ad library is not working. We cannot see their ads, Ryan. But we are going to see their funnel. Um, what do we know about this funnel? They've spent $60 on ads, so it's very new. We're just going to give you overall advice. Um, you have your current CPA 80. So by one sale A OV 350 this is INR so it's not USD scale it scale it up and want to spend more 80 80 to 320 I don't even know what that is but just scale it how it is I want you to keep running it yeah I think it's just fine I don't know why you submitted it but let's do it it's doing great um this is a better funnel that we've seen some of these I like the check boxes I just like clicking on. You know, you need to Is that what those artists perform? Oh, yeah. They Yeah. Yeah. They don't They don't do anything. It's a Russell Brunson thing. He did it before a long time ago. H long time ago. Oh, man. They got proof for what he was on. Yeah. So, you got proof. Is it Is that compliant? I don't know. Not my problem. But, okay. So overall powerful system easily turns into highly paid UX UI designer gets paid 60 INR I think to one uh I don't know I really shouldn't I don't know that no experience needed no expensive courses no cheap clients ever okay this is we talked about the last one your guys' sub headlines need to be way more specific on what they're avoiding and don't just throw it out there and think it doesn't mean what you think to me the sub headline carries more weight than the main headline because you're showing them all the things that it's not and that's the biggest thing to stand out. And so people obsess over the headline. I obsess over the sub headline. So it's like no expensive courses. Now you just put them in a mindset of thinking about the times they bought expensive courses. They're about to buy a course and even though yours isn't expensive, they're now thinking negatively of like, oh, when I purchase education before, you see, Ryan. So it's like you got to think about what this does to people when they're going through it. And then you know the no experience needed that's fine like with I dude without saying without needing any experience dealing with clients who are headache or like clients who don't pay you know pay you enough for your work um you know without any startup costs. You can say something like that like instead of expensive courses be more specific on what it is they're avoiding and what makes this different without is it without sales calls? Can they do this without competing on job boards? Like what is really making uh it stick out? So I like that. The job job boards one. Yeah. Can you scroll through the page? I want to see. So like it looks like it's like a bundle of ebooks products based on that. So what will you do now? That's a little You know how I feel about design on stuff like that. I'd even it out. Make sure it's like have you should like Yeah. It's like the whole sultanic thing trying to make it simple, but it's almost the wrong It's almost the wrong way around, right? Where it's like Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like a result list, but yeah. Okay. Yes, I will become I don't know who the demo is or like but there's some grim like grammar or capitalization some simple stuff. Just very simple doesn't necessarily mean it's going to break it. Button don't have a moving button. It's annoying the freak out of me. It's going to annoy people. Only system you will ever need now. Um there's some stuff there that's a little just like only system you'll need to achieve outcome not now to get this thing you want. This is the only system you need to blah blah. And then obviously these are capitalized. It's called the 1% designer system is like the Yeah. ESP. Okay. What's the system? What's the button? Oh, it's a much longer page. Got it. Yes. We got Okay. I'm curious on mobile. I should look at mobile what this looks like. What were those examples? What happens with the system? You get messages where should I send the payment? That sounds like a good one. Yeah. No, that's good. That's I think that's what it means. Like you're saying if you buy this then you get these outcomes. Uh yeah, clients is I don't think you need to do this. I think you can just you just say like, hey, when you use this, you're going to, you know, have clients wanting to pay you. Uh you know, they're not going to like they don't they won't have to think about it. They're just going to want to get started right away. um clients wanting to, you know, hire you more than once. Um inbound client, you know, like selling outcomes better than just this because then you have to they're kind of doing the math or trying to instead of creating the imagination for them, you're making them try to imagine themselves, which is just I'd rather just tell them what's going to happen. Crazy, right? No, you don't want to make it like crazy, right? Assuming that they don't think it's crazy cuz then you're trying to like it feels too forced. It's like, dude, isn't that crazy? Like Ryan, dude, like is that so sick? It's like me asking for a compliment. I'm like baiting like trying to get Ryan to be like, "Ryan, isn't it cool that I've just crossed 2,000 subscribers and everyone watching this should go subscribe me so I can pass Ryan?" Dude, is that so cool? Ryan, it's like Ryan's just going to hang up because I'm poaching his audience and asking for a compliment. So, you see, you see, you don't want to do that just happened right there. So, go through this. What's the next one? Testimonial section. Testimonials and then just more and then No, no. So, there you go. Okay. So, there's the stack. Here we go. Now, we're getting some stack here. UI resource. I like the design. Like your mockups are nice. You want to go up. So what are Yeah. What are the core ones on this? Yeah. Right there. So I think this is the main entire playbook. So learn how to build them. Learn the secret to designing them. Okay. So it's UI chunks. The next one is there's the MA UX master guide. Okay. So you got UI plus UX. That's the core. And then it's ultimate Figma. I think it's so funny because I think people can like literally sell like you can't sell that on its own like UI mistakes and fixes or like the case study the case study template the one up there like the Figma playbook or whatever that was called Figma pack like you can sell those left and right so today only $2.99 now Ryan there's a big issue I wonder if you noticed this too with this offer and for everyone watching this you can think about this for yourself too maybe if you're making this mistake too but we see a lot of language on like getting clients now clients who want to pay you and this this and that, but I haven't seen the connection to how like I will get clients by purchasing the Figma mistakes or Figma pack or like I don't see the connection of how the learning how to design is going to get more clients. That could be the best design in the world and no one's going to pay me which is like designer's biggest issue. Yeah, it's a classic info coaching. It's like get clients then it's like productize and be better at your service and then it's like scale, right? So about getting if this is about getting clients, it has nothing to do with getting clients on page. So your stack is flawed. Uh this would be like get clients, get better at design so they want to pay you more, make you testimonials and like scale build a team to and outsource all the work. Like that's why I see the upsell flow. Did you talk about what the system is? That's a good question. It's the number one system though. It's the top. It's the only system you need. I know that 1% system. So right there. What is it? Okay. Okay. Here we go. Project. Stand out in interviews. Land high paying jobs. Recruiters saying you're hiring. Yeah, that's like kind of in the right direction, I feel like. But it's like implying like you have to get good at design before you can get hired. Shoot, I have to learn all this stuff and get good at design and then I'll get hired. It's like I would rather do like an MV I would do like an offer where it's like uh MVP portfolio or something like how to build a minimum viable portfolio that wows clients like super easy. It's like uh you know instant portfolio where it's like we're going to show you download. Yeah. Like white label our portfolio and templates that you can instantly wow creators but like I get and then how you fulfill it is you just subcontract us and then you just do it. Dude, people do that. People do that and crush with it. Yeah. So anyways, you explain the system more all the run more ads scale it up. Uh I think we're good on this Ryan. There's a lot that you know once you have more data it be better but so what is that is that top or is that a second page second page check out different I don't know what did it just do second page looks like yeah yeah so again more stuff on design we already signed a ton of design stuff it's like these people want clients dude like I know designers like my designers they love me cuz I've sent them a lot of deals but before that they were like competing trying to be really good designers and I know amazing designers There's like the amazing amazing photo designers who have no work because they just don't know how to put themselves out there and become better known. And that's like the biggest flaw. Like a lot of a lot of designers are going to be behind the scenes and designing and they're they're more introverted and really good at like just seeing stuff. They're not like the runaround man look at me blah blah blah blah. Like those are the copyriters. Um and so these people they need a way where they can be loud and become better known without like feeling like they're having to like do the dance. So I think if you made iteration order bump is not colors and type it's I'm flipping it. I'm literally going to take the if you're if I'm in their shoes I'm taking this whole offer. This is now an upsell one or two and I'm making the front end around what I said like MVP portfolio or mockup where it's like get clients like here's how to wow clients with a complete beginner with only like a simple portfolio and like you don't need to have a bunch of experience. You don't need results because I was like holy crap. Then if you can fulfill on that then great. But that's what I would do if I'm in your shoes. Yep. I do like the two steps. Usually if you go down on that little is that a down cell as a as a radio razor pay. Oh no, it's the addition. I you added the upsell. I was like I thought the one was one. Okay. And then what were his stats? He said they were like um reworking it. But yeah, he spent spent $60 which is like five. So any current CPA 60 to make 350 I mean yeah you can or 80 to make 350. I mean obviously something's working. I don't know what the upsell track is and I don't think you have links on them but keep running. It's like a rebuild for sure if you're going to do what Josh said. Um but I think it's probably more scalable and more realistic for your market to do what Josh said. So leaning into doing acquisition and how to make it easier to get good clients first. Then you can productize. You can do that. It's literally the classic info coaching stack. So yeah, especially like and then uh big thing is you're selling Indian market if they're selling to states other places. a big thing like talking to a lot of my uh team members who like one of my my really good team members fulfillment partners um is he's from India and one of the biggest things like mindset wise like feeling you're not good enough just you're not from a first world country which is not true at all and so one big thing is like mindset wise building their confidence and how to like reshame re reshape how they look at themselves which helps with converting clients so you can add that as a bump I would say in there so um Cool. Anything else, Ryan? No, no, no. What you got on these other ones? All right, so let's pull. Looks like we got ad library. Let's see if this is this the one we don't have any. Uh, is this Yeah. Yes. Yeah. This is not my offer. You probably know who they are. Yeah. Okay. Let's see here. This is not my offer. Women weight lo weight loss. Yeah, I know. I know nothing about that. So, yeah, I'll step it. I got you guys. Women over 45 classic. Okay. Dang, bro. Dang. This is me going. Wait, does this offer you probably know Andrew? I do know Andrew. I know the guy who had his offer. I'm pretty sure he I I don't know. I think he exited his offer. Uh but he sold it or like left it. Uh, I know. I don't know how much we can say, but I think he gave up a percentage of the company to somebody else. Got it. All right, let's check those pages. Looks like a free training or it looks like a VSSL funnel. All right, so we got landing page. Go to Now we're talking my speed. I think every single one we've done of these except one have been low ticket. It's because everyone just I'm posting it to everyone just low ticket follows like no low ticket. Okay. Um, let's look at the He also said, uh, emails. Can you write two or three short emails? Oh, and he's asking you to do that for him. Yeah, I can't write emails for you, bro. I'm not an email writer. AI is though. Just I just write all my emails. AI booking page. Can you look at our page? We'll book it and give some simple ideas. Okay. So, we don't know much about it. We're just going to give overview. Ryan, you're a big call booking guy. What do you think of this old? You remember the Sam Ovens funnel table, bro? That's what this is. That is Yeah. session happening soon. Is wait, so is it a is it a web? It is just in time web. Yeah, just in time. This offer did make decent money from what I know. Like enough to be able to like sell it or sell a percentage a majority of it. So it is a good set of your metabolism. Uh um yeah, I mean design-wise, yeah, this is OG. Again, ugly stuff works. So I'm not even going to comment on the design because it is what it is. But like what's what's the copy on there? There's weight loss release. It's a brand new that's compliant. That's smart. Weight release. That's sneaky. You're not losing weight. You're just releasing it. FTC finally re release weight for good. Without shakes, pills, powders, fat dieting, or intense exercise. So that's good. I mean, that's that's on brand. Um why focusing on weight? Can you scroll a little? Sorry, my face is in the way. Yeah. Oh, shoot. Focusing on weight loss and counting calories backfires while releasing weight becomes harder and harder with every diet. How intense calorie? Yeah, I mean it's solid. We worked with over 2200 people. 62. I hate when there's like again I'm not even to comment on the design because again sometimes ugly things work but like I like we have a page right now that I built which is ugly and I'm like not proud of it and it's outperforming everything right now and it's like just hurts my souls. It looks like this. Um okay. So and then it's what it's just reserve spot now. That's it. And then they then they go to calendar. This is crazy. OG, this is getting so many app on there. Uh, is it built into there? It must be after I figure time. Oh man. Giving away all your sauce right now. Yeah. Everyone email me. I can't wait to get emails. Everyone want my number too. Here you go. Call me too. I dare you. I have two. I have two though. This is better. Oh yeah, there you go. Okay, so honestly, someone trying to sell me something. Honestly, call me. I want him to get sold. I love cold emails. I love cold text. I opt into everything. What was he asking? What What are his questions about this? So, he's taking over the booking page. We don't know, dude. He probably as a client. So, I don't have access to any of your stuff. Give simple ideas to help more people actually book. So, the help people help more people actually book is going to exist on the webinar that we did not see. So, do you want to watch? No, I don't want to watch the webinar right now, but it's going to be on the webinar. So, depending on I mean, right, like to try and give some value here. Yeah. Like again, everything everything that's a funnel, everything in the funnel. So, you're going to have your ads, your cost per click, your whatever. We already saw your ads look, whatever. Relatively solid. We don't know the numbers on them, so you can't really give any feedback. They land on this page. What percentage of them then become, you know, webinar opt-ins? Then, how many of those people show up for it? So, what kind of email sequences exist? what kind of framing exists that makes it so they actually show for the thing that's in one minute or 30 minutes or whatever. Okay, optimize for that rate. Then once they're on there, what is the pe what is the conversion of people that actually are on the webinar live and or come from replay or whatever that then actually book a call. If that portion is what's broken and you think that these other ones are good because the economics or the whatever, then all you have to solve for is the webinar. Like very simply put, I know a ton of people right now that are cranking webinar to direct to cart. So I don't know what kind of offer stack you have on the back, but like if you can sell something that's 500, a,000, 2,000 basically caps out at 2,000 depending on how you're looking at it, but like thousand ones are cranking right now. Pay plan ones are cranking right now through that. And then having your onboarding call focused around ascension and pushing them to your high ticket coaching, like I've heard that is I mean I've seen that that is absolutely crushing. So I don't I have no information on where to help you with what you are trying to fix on this right now. What was the other question? Can you write emails for what? Booking. Can we write to get people to like book a call or like show up for the Is that what the first question actually was on there? Yeah. I think it was a email. Can you write two or three short emails that get people excited and curious to watch our free Yeah. So they're having an issue with getting people to show for it. It sounds like because who else would they be emailing unless they're cold emailing? So yeah, it sounds like you have multiple things right there. So framing to get them to actually want to show emails, reminders, all that stuff. You need to optimize the [ __ ] out of that to get them on the free training. And then once they're on the free training, it sounds like you also are having an issue of conversion rate to booking, which can either be offset and like you don't have to play the volume of booking games if you don't want to. Um, what was the range on the booking widget? Was it two days or was it looked I feel like it was further, but I don't remember. Uh, you want to rebook again? No, just go back. You don't have to rebook. I leak my information again. No, you don't have to opt. Oh, I mean guess you can opt in. You're going to get all the email opting page. Oh, yeah. Sorry. [Laughter] Okay, here we go. This is a mess. Um, that's too far. That's way too far. So, you don't have same day available. I don't know what time zone, but you don't have same day and you're going out four days. Your show rates are probably no bueno as well. So, couple little plugs here and I bet it just flips on its head and works fine. Yep. And then other thing too, best time to run a webinar is not on like right now we just do it where it's 8:00 PM EST. Uh, and we run it every day. So it's always on it's on demand or it's like just in time, but it's a set time. It's not just like one minute. So that gives time to prepare. They're done working. They can sit at home. They can watch it. So split test times as well because it's like, dude, what if I'm busy? It's like one minute. So like it started like in one minute or something like that. Yeah. What does the next one do? probably see. Let me reset it and see if it resets the third like it's kind of it's it's like a VSSL. You might as well just go right to like when you made direct application at that point. Like you're pretty much just doing it. I don't know. I haven't run these in a very long time. We ran this in 201 19 I think that we had something like this that existed and I was part of the team fully and we were running this. It was a 497 auto web and there was no ascension. There was no nothing. It was literally just like existed on the site and we would get like two three units a day and we were like, "Oh, I wonder if we should run paid to this." Um, that's awesome. And then we brought to a call. So, I don't know. I mean, there's not enough context to really like be able to directly help, but yep. All right. Um, so this next one here, what's the other problem? So, they just said, uh, just for the front of now, super new offer, only spent 320 on ads to really say got 13 sales out of which nine were tests. So for so for the four cell it's about four. [Laughter] Yeah, let's not count the test purchases and the total sale count. Um all right, so we have four sales 320 or is it out of these four? I think one or two are people are past customers. That's okay on past customers depending on what your flow is. That happens all the time. like our low ticket for example like we'll do 50% of them are existing leads in the CRM because we have a massive CRM over years of data. So when it wants when we launched our low ticket um I like pages like this honestly a lot. Um but yeah so that it having past customers purchase is not really an issue unless the only thing you're going to sell them is into the thing that they already own then that's an issue. So, like for us in the like when I'm saying they already exist in the CRM, they're not past purchasers. They're past leads that are coming through that we paid for through the VSSL opt-in funnel, the direct application funnel, a month later, two years later, they come back, they buy the low ticket thing, and it's like they're reintroduction, and they go from lead to buyer, which is like a good thing. And then you transition them, they're generally warmer, they already have the consumption, they already have that stuff. So, like that's a good thing. It's just like just know that those are different stats and the cost per purchase on those is much different than it is on straight up cold traffic. So, you haven't scaled anywhere near high enough to get out of your pocket of warm. So, your stats right now are going to be buffered and look different than they're going to look when you're scaled into cold. So, um haven't started working on this offer yet. This is so funny. So, these guys are all just like guys who are landing these offers and haven't run them. Yes, sir. We got a lot of You guys want your funnel reviewed? We'll leave the audit. You should leave the link in the your description below if you want to do more. If you guys want to be featured, might have it below. Um so personal development three days one powerful shift rewrite. So it's like mindset biggest thing is like you're earning oh you're earning power so it's like money it's related to money. You're out here crushing goals. Okay. There's voice in your head. So it's like mindset. Here's what Lawrence used to sound like. How does the intro still sound more hustle shifting way you see yourself? So I immediately I'm like this mechanism isn't like irrational enough or like unique enough where it's like going to stand out a ton. I don't know Ryan. Like I I just feel like I've heard I know I'm in the market but like first of all like just rewiring the voice and running the show like I'll be the perfect one. Yeah, I was on with Luke earlier and he was like, "You'll get this book." And it was like along the lines of this, right? And it was like talking about like reframing and how that's all or rewiring and how that always matters and constantly coming back to baseline. So like there is obviously the market that hits it. I just don't know if the wording around this. So like what was the first one? Sorry. The voice that got you here. Okay. The power over pressure. Own it. See it. Own it. Shift it. And then the identity is a strategy. Um, I think you can do a little better with like USP language within there. Um, when you install the system, I hate GHL popups. Next identity match your goal. Dude, I don't I don't like, but again, uh, ugly things convert. Ugly things convert. So, um, all right. And then, so if you go to the top, stupid simple thing, but the, uh, video player, not a vibe. So, if you refresh that page, Oh yeah. I don't know if you can even track what your view rate is on whatever that is. Looks like Vimeo, but don't So get on V V Turb, get on Vidalytics, get on Wistia, get on something that has that like video autoplay. Stupid simple thing, but like just increases your play rate to like 95%. Like people are on page for a reason. Has the text already showing on page, which I like that you're doing that. You're already out here crushing goals. You're already out here doing this, this, this. Like if that video is good enough, it can do the whole it can do the whole selling process for you. like you don't like people just zoom through the page. Let's make it a good conversation that you're having in your own head. Like I like the idea of it. I mean crazy. You know what this is missing? This is missing a narrative or um I think yeah it's like I think about I'll use Iman Godzi's example cuz he I feel like he's like the king of or his team or whoever's doing it these days. Really good narratives and like themes. I know Allan Sultan called like a theme where it's like this overarching theme that carries throughout the whole funnel. So like Iman, he'll take like his same thing and he'll like care like the same product but he has a new theme with it. It's remote revolution or it's like the one thing and a great reset like this theme that's going through and it's like it's so like catchy a theme and an angle where it doesn't he doesn't talk about the mechanism but the theme kind of carries it well with personal development. Look at Tony Robbins. All his events have these themes like the something something event. It's like this big grand theme and it's like the theme sells it why it should show up and sells the outcome without talking too much of the mechanism. So with personal development I think having a theme and a narrative is big. Uh and so like one of the themes we're coming up with one of our offers is like the tipping point. And so it's like oh I'm not going to go detail what that is but you have a theme that's going to carry through with that. And we're not going to even talk too much about the mechanism on the front end, but we're selling like this narrative on the front end. So, I think you just need to get more clear on what your theme is like Tony Robbins. And then he had not really any stats on it. Yeah, I mean test sales. Um, we got a bet. We I don't know if we you said earlier it's like people probably don't want to share their links. So, like it's kind of hard to do this other than if we just pull other people's links, but if we pull other people's links, we also don't have the data. So, it's like I don't proper way for us to get data to like actually help these public if people aren't going to share. Oh, there we go. 5 to 7K spent. Yeah, we got one to five. $1,700 new client small. Thank you. Spoke it into existence. Thank you. That page for teaching me. All right. Um, are you serious about scaling your e-commerce brand? That looks like a career need content now. All right. All right. So, what's going on here? You're looking to grow with high performance uh high performing ad creative. You know what's you know what's kind of immediately comes out to me is like I had no idea this was like targeting an e-commerce owner. Me either. That's what I said. I thought I thought it was like career based. I thought it was likely an Upwork ad. Oh, nothing about this implies it's to a brand. It doesn't even show a Shopify logo. It doesn't show a dashboard. It doesn't show anything that signals like something that a Shopify person would relate to. So immediately an issue because like you want to, you know, we're at the event in Dallas and Eddie uh shared how like some of their best ads are when like the real estate professionals film in their environment that their freaking customers are in. So like in front of the home, for the garage, or I have a friend who does a fitness and he does corporate America. So he always films in front of like a random corporate building where like the people are working. Like it connects to them. So immediately your creatives are just nothing creative. Uh uh send blue they always do the funniest ones right now they're crushing and then more in this in our world Robvi his ads like Ravi Abu Abalo yeah I have him oh he's coming on the pod next week by the way he's coming on next one first interviews back on your page the other day um but all to say he has an ad that's static and it's a screenshot of the Hyros dashboard and it's just showing the uh initial source and it just says is YouTube and it's like his it's his back office of them getting all high ticket clients coming from first source click um YouTube organic and like only if you know do you know so like I'm not in physical e-commerce but like triple whale for example or like like I don't know what exists in the back show you like what content shows that it got a 5x return or whatever but like using the Ravi example if you had something like that where like an e-commerce person saw it and was like oh that came from organ I don't even know what you're trying to sell you're trying to sell high performing ad creative so just like rorowaz as like literally having dashboards that show rorowaz and like that are specific in triple whale or in hyros or in whatever. Yeah. So like you know even having like this is a random person looked up but even this like it shows like some examples of UGC and like rorowass CPM things are calling out to who they are. Um yeah like these people like there's a lot of people they run they'll show like examples of creator creatives too. It's like UGGC ads will do video stuff. So you're competing against this like thing competing against this. Learn how to turn product photos into winning ad creatives in minutes. Never pay for designers again. Yeah. So your ads need to and your offer needs to compete with this. Yeah, I see those all the time. That right there where it's like after before AI after AI the UGC ones where it shows like a canvas of like multiple UGC's like one core product and then shows like you know eight different faces on there. I don't know what the actual offer is. Do they have the land around there? This one? No. No. In the in the Oh, yeah. We can get to that. Yeah, we can get I just want to see what they're actually selling to see if we can back into it. Yep. $250 booked call $17,000. Like it looks techy now. It goes from being like it looks like it's software. Yeah, it's 500 software. is like I book a call and I'm like e I'm out like that though is right direction right this should be your creatives bro like why aren't you showing my numbers on the creatives like this should be your ad bro 100% I would get more interested on that yeah agreed agreed agreed multiple format hooks what is that like gas I don't know why this is so satisfying I'm just going to Dang. I love how those sites like this. I'd never like put much love in his sights. That's crazy. I love it. Um, yeah. I mean, I like the page. I like the page. I definitely definitely look software. I'm going to be honest, but like that doesn't necessarily need to be creatives. Why aren't these real results? I mean, those don't have row like if you can get triple whale screenshots moving and grooving on like what actual like layer those in the front. What is ads? Um, what did you even Sorry, I cut you off. I just want to go ads. Does it say? Okay, so free. This dasher makes me feel like AI wrote this, but uh, elevate your strategy. Elevate your ad strategy. I don't really think that's what they say. Like I think this with a AI. Yeah, I I think you did too. Nor do those creatives connect to that software lander. It doesn't. Also, here's the thing, Ryan. If you're selling creatives, you kind of have to have really good creatives. Like I know when I sell to like marketers, like if I'm selling to other marketers, I have so much pressure that my ads need to like be so like sometimes what convinces them is just the fact they have a really unique ad or like something impresses them like, "Huh, that's good." So you need creators that like are going to wow these people to show that you're legit. Whereas this, it's like, are they just going to make me craft GBT generated images? Um, so I don't know. I think your page looks great. I'm more so like on the ad side. Um, this is better. Like meme style, these work really well for us. Yeah. Um, so at least that's better, you know. Even that even if it was that with the the crazy behavior. That's crazy behavior. But like overlay even those like ad types though. But if the whole thing is like that is not at all that there you go. That is that is more similar to the actual website, right? where it's like branding, where it's like call outs, where it's bright colors. Look at Yeah, that's that's I don't know, Brad, but I would literally like my images would just say it's free. If you're doing a free thing, I would just say like free ad like I would just show like what if you get creators look like this for free and then show your creators like I don't know like it's your thing a free offer. So it shouldn't be super easy hook and copy. I don't think you need AI to write write this stuff for you. It's pretty like that that theme and branding of that video ad except there's no testimonials or like case study or like anything in there which is very interesting to me. So like you have them all on the website. I don't know why you're not using them. I also do like the graphic that's on the side. Again, it also doesn't matter like cuz ugly graphics work, pretty graphics work. Like different ads that could be the nicest looking ad like doesn't necessarily work, but like having that that's more in alignment and then what happens when they click to the page? It goes over to that page right there and then there's a book a call. Yeah. So they clear the page. It goes to this page and then it's book a call. Start with our scale system and it's get started. Is that compliant? I don't think so. But whatever. The other thing I do is I compliant in my life. But you can say imply scarcity without for$1 to20 million Shopify brands. Like that's amazing. I don't know why they're not using that. also small thing and you're not going to change your whole company, but that like BMW/BBWM thing is like kind of confusing and it kind of looks like BMW ads, but just saying. Um, and then he's had he said $1,700 cost per client, which is like solid. I mean, you can get that down obviously, but for $250 calls, which means a $250 call with a $1,700, it's a 15% sales per booking. So, you're making 2x on the front. you're you're in the LTV business, so you know, keeping someone for 10 months. I don't know what your retainers are, but pretty solid. And 15% sales for booking is interesting because it's not like a high ticket call funnel. Um, so yeah, it's all different. Yeah. So, I don't know because that means, you know, for us in our math, that's like a 50% show rate and a 30% live call close. 15%, right? Because it's those blended. Yep. So, it should definitely be higher than that. But $250 call booked for someone who's likely a pretty large client depending on what they're seeing on site. I think your AOV I mean your AOV is different than your LTV, but it doesn't sound like it's bad. So some tweaks on creative to get that cost per call to 150 bucks or whatever and then dialing in the sales process. I don't know what your offer is too where you're getting an AOV for 35 3500 but you're saying it's free for 30 days. I don't know if that's like postpurchase but kind of sounds like there's a little bit of stuff in the economics that you can tweak. Yeah. Um, crazy thumbnail here. My buddy, we we put together offer my local agency buddy here in uh in Minnesota free ad creative. And this is just like the hook that's working super well. So, I'll play it just a text so you guys can read it and see it. But it's it's just like this. That'd be good. Oh, yeah. So, it goes claim. There you go. Testimonial. Oh, shoot. Who's that? Who's that? So yeah, that that's great that I mean like testimonial. You have all these testimonials. Hit them with testimonials. Then explain a little bit more like see like here why it's like hey we're looking you know this they'll shoot at it. Here's your offer blah blah blah. I won't do all that. Luckily he's local. I wouldn't share that if he was mass market. But you can you know rip something like that uh and just do that for your offer. That'd be sick. So, anything else on that? No, no, I think that's a good one. It's a cool I mean I like the I like the business. I just don't know. Again, the whole hard part about doing these is it's kind of constantly shifting, dude. You don't have enough information to like because they could be crushing it. There could be like one metric that's broken or like one part part of the flow that's broken that you're like, "Oh, duh. If you change this, holy shoot, his $250 call, is that like actual calls?" Like if he made it a two-step opt in to that if he did it as a case study demo versus direct to book a call which is isn't even book a call. It's a form fill that has a ton of questions and then you have to then refill to likely then book a call. And it's like could you make it less friction? Could you add more consumption with something that's like a case study VSSL walkthrough? Could you could you could you like I don't I don't have data but yeah. So if you guys want if we were doing these again we'll leave a form below. Give us more data. Uh if you want things to be private, let us know. Um but if you obviously there's a lot of lessons here you can take away from it. You probably maybe saw something we mentioned in this and you're like oh frick I didn't my creatives aren't calling on my audience or suit my offer on the front end. I'm talking about getting clients but has nothing to do with getting like whatever it may be. Think about some of those things that you may have in your funnel and try some new split tests and put it to use. Some little nuggets you can put out there and increase your conversions potentially. Raw. What else is fun and up? Or should we just pop? I mean, I've heard some cool stuff like some stories like some I won't like just cool things are working. We talk about that. What cool things are working? Webinars to $250 products. Really? Yeah. Live two automated daily in. Yeah, it's like later in the day. It's like a few hours later. Um, and they're doing female market $250. Nothing else on the back end. 2.5 return spending 5k a day right now. Last I heard. Um, not going to say who or what market cuz no, it's a publisher. It's off publisher. Shot off publishing. Took somebody from zero. Literally, this is a nobody. Made them into somebody on cold traffic and then also helped with organic now. And so they took the model. It took like a nobody and did that and they started with like mini chat ads to ever webinar and they were just running that and it's a female market which is huge. It's a unique kind of mechanism as well which I think helps like the fact it's a female market not competition allows them to compete in those economics. So their cost per lead is very low. So my thought is now I'm looking like what is a marketer who's not out of competition that I can publish somebody who's a female and do a $250 product and run that autobi because like dude the fulfillment it's just like a $250 product there's no fulfillment costs the it just runs it obviously you hear that oh what a dream business I don't have to do anything of course there be issues that come later but like dude that's that's pretty crazy I did not think that auto web could work and $250 the economics it only worked because our cost per lead was like it's like $2 or something. Yeah. So, I thought that was pretty interesting. I thought that was really interesting. I heard one today that someone spending mid four figures and is doing like a four to 5x on a front end of supplements right now. It's like bringing back that game. So, bundles and doing all that, it's like a distraction me and us. Like just does not make sense for us to do right now. Like, oh, and this and this and this. And then like supplements have fulfillment. When would I focus? I have a whole new approach that we have decided on that we're going into. So we're going to do ours that's going to be we're start we're going to start back end. So it's going to be post purchase of the coaching. We're going to start there just because I don't want to f I don't want to try and sell direct to cart and then try and bridge and whatever. Like right now it's like how do we make more LTV for the current entry flow. It's like we're optimizing entry flows. We have multiple different acquisition models. we have XYZ. Let's get the cost per purchase to X through those. Once we have those up and cranking, want to crack a cold one specific, a cold uh buyer funnel, so like a low ticket and then a lead cold that's like proper uh because we currently have our main and then we have multiple of those, multiple brand faces, blah blah blah, distribution or uh diversification. Then going to layer in doing the other pieces of supplements, things like that. And there's some other things that we're talking about doing. But then I think that once we have it hammered out and we can do the fulfillment of those things well because I don't trust that we're going to be able to like right off the rip just like rip it on direct response ads and fulfill on it in two seconds. Like I think that's going to be a lot more difficult than I just want to distract. So we're going to wait until I don't know a month six million a month or something right now. adding adding in that next level like the supplements then what would that take you to 10 with those in addition yeah likely yeah that makes sense that makes I mean because supplements are only it's way lower ticket right it's just like the MR game so like at that time will we be in the direction of 10 yes are we actually going to just like flip a switch and then go from five or six to 10 no but in like a in a 90 to 180 yeah I would assume so like Yeah, we're doing that. I mean, we're at 800 on the month. Let's say the 7th. So, seventh and we had three days of like we had three days of non-existent because of the holiday. Yeah, dude. Okay, let's talk about that. Why? You should have done a video on this. Did you do a video on You did? All right. I don't watch I said holidays. I said holidays ruin call funnels. Here's how to fix it. Okay, you're running out of idea. I don't watch YouTube. I'm fasting for so I don't know what you're posting. But with your Yeah, I'm fasting. It's I'm just doing I have a goal. It's like I want to hit this and then I'll get YouTube. But once then you'll eat again. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm only drinking protein shakes until I get my YouTube back. But the call like holidays, did you guys try to deflect at all? Like do you ever do like or like Christmas? What do you thinking ahead? We're coming towards Thanksgiving, Christmas. How is your company like prepared for that in the past? You learn any lessons? Kind of thinking ahead here because we're getting we're getting close to it. What? Reframe. Reframe. It's summer, right? We're enjoying summer. Things are great right now. We're going to enjoy summer and all these info people are going to get out. All a sudden, frick. We're Q4. Thanksgiving's coming up. Then we got Christmas. Call funnels are like historically annoying. Then so thinking ahead, just help people start thinking ahead here. Like what can we start preparing for? Call funnels are just a different beast. It's like you either choose to burn the cash or you choose to burn the opportunity cost. And it's like one of the two because people are going to buy in those days. It's like the same way that if you have like outside of work hours call availability like there are people that work during the day and can never take a call and buy from you because the only way they can buy thing is over the phone and they can't do it during the workday. So like they have to have it outside of that. So there's very similar where like we always laugh cuz like Super Bowl for example, you will have extremely low like show rates, live call, close once that like kicks off, but literal kicks off. Um but during that you have all the you know 40 to 60 year old women that sit there and they'll opt in and you have like crazy good rates in terms of like ad clicks or scrolling. So the direct toart stuff so I've heard crushes during these kind of times when people are just on their phone. Like there's not really a time and a holiday and whatever where people are like off their phones nowadays. No. So, you know, so it's not like it's like the market doesn't shut down. So, ecom guys crush it in those zones. We're in fitness. Fitness is notoriously not good in Q4 unless you have a complete framing thing around like the anti of what's going on, but then supposedly we get it all back when we hit Q1 because you get the January stuff which is like window before people fall off. So, like our entire goal is to make things evergreen. But my video was basically around like how can you create revenue, you know, stealing Iman's framing or phrase, but like revenue generating events. Like he does revenue generating events, which you guys I know you do. Like you have Yeah. So we do Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and we do uh Christmas in July basically. We don't actually call it that, but like same thing. It's like a six month apart range. Started today. Oh, gonna be a nice little month. Yeah, started today. So we'll only do ours. So uh this one right here is internal only. So meaning renewals only. So we do a massive push internal. We do internal contests. We do uh we have pointbased system for sales reps that incentivize them to work on holidays. Because when you're doing the call funnel, you have two you have twofold. You have so I'm talking more on like a let's use fourth of July example. So when you have that you have your team that doesn't want to work. So you have availability that goes like this. And then you have the client base or the potential clients that don't want to book a call across this range because they're on a boat or they're going here, they're going there. So it's like you have both of those playing against you and you have a 50k a day ad budget humming daily filling your calendars and then you have a three-day lull. So it's like what happens now? It's like you leave it, you cut a little or you cut a ton and it's like you try and go to like 10k days and you turn off all your like performing [ __ ] and then all of a sudden you have to try and ramp it back up when a day in, three days in on the last day and then try and fill calendars for Monday where you have 300 open spots and over the weekend you have 80 open spots. So it's like generally speaking looking at the math it kind of makes most sense to continue to spend into it. Cut the waste, cut the testing, cut the whatever is like not working. So, like don't just full bore it, but like continue on. Um, and like this isn't 100% my realm, but like we had a conversation about this and that's exactly what we decided to do. We made some like pretty normal cuts on stuff that was like not directly performing or that was kind of sitting in creative testing. The other thing with CallFunnels is the time from lead to call, time from lead to close. So, like you're still spending it. It's not like it's going to like a page that just can't accept payment. They just potentially are landing on a page to book a call and it's not there a not then available. So making sure you use the data properly so you get all the leads, you get all the apps and making sure that you're emailing them or your setters are hitting them or whatever's happening so that they can be optimiz can make it into the bookings just like not on those days. So we'll do that kind of like the front end portion. We incentivize sales reps to work by giving them 1.5x points. So we have a pointbased system for our like bonus pools. So they get 1.5x for weekends and holidays and we'll like aggressively kind of amp into that so that they want to work there and hit bonus it want to work those hours and hit bonuses. And then the other one is yeah those revenue generating events for July. Ours is just internal. So we'll just hammer it home that it's like you get a second year or two more years or whatever at a discounted rate. We do it once uh we do it for a week and that's it. And it's just like submit a form, book a call if you want to talk about financing or whatever, but just like or click here and just charge my card on file, fill out an order form directly. It's like big big like today we have Yeah. Insane. That's awesome. Incentives. Incentives. Incentives in either direction because you got it's just like and we're not a specials company at all. Like if anything, our pricing just continues to go up. Even our special this year is the highest it's ever been because our even our special pricing continues to rise. So, it's like we aren't, you know, the cheapos uh in the market by any means, but we're also not like top tier, most expensive, whatever, no specials ever, whatever. We we try and leverage both. So, we did try and change the framing on low ticket to be like Fourth of July special and then just leave the same percentage off and like it kind of got some there was like some effect, but like instantly kind of turned it off. So when you in you talk about incentivizing the sales team whatever I always wonder how do you incentivize like CMOs or the marketers like for like our entire blended one is on CPA. So CPA. Yeah. So it's like a blended metric. So it doesn't exist like in a in like a vacuum of that event for example but like we have blended numbers. So you're talking about like overall marketing like Yeah. Like on your low ticket like I'm thinking about like with a set of eyes. We're just working. We might change this. This is actually a great point, but we might change this, but like right now ours is based on the high ticket CPA, which is a function of the low ticket CPA. So if you get the economics right on the low ticket, it is the lowest CPA you'll have for your backend. And so like we use blended stats for all of that. So as long as the CPA is like in pocket there, so say you have a $120 net CPA and you have a 5% ascension rate, that's a $2,400 CPA. Let's say get they get that net CPA to 80 bucks. that drops it to a $1,700 CPA. I'm sorry, $1,600 CPA and it's like boom. Now you can have tranches where you have like different bonuses and whatever where the CPA and it's paired with volume. I think that works really well. Um what about would you ever do CK just on the front? Well, I guess it's same, but it's not because if they hammered the front like yeah, you want the back, but like it's the the true all-encompassing number is how much does marketing generate? How much? Yeah. At what cost? or next division which is like the other pain though honestly is CPA is a function of sales reps too because if they aren't closing or if they have a 15% close rate the freak how the freak do your marketer he's just like he doesn't the sales team and like make sure it's like just stay and everything Jeremy Haynes said at some level it's like you want to treat sales reps almost like cashiers and like he said like you know like you want them to be just collecting payments so like what do you have to do on the marketing front to get it so the economics work where someone shows up to the call in general so like what's the framing? Right now, one of our biggest issues is show rate and like that's a marketing thing. It happens before they cancel before a sales rep can even reach them. That is not a sales rep's fault. They can hit them as many times as possible. It's like it's not. So, having the back-end sales systems, as Jeremy Hayn says, in place so that you're that's why I was telling him this morning, I was like, if we just optimize around cost per live call, not cost per call, cost per live call, which then in introduces the show up rate, uh which then, you know, is then cost per sale because we know our basic close rates. Of course, we're working on sales. Of course, we're trying to optimize show or close rates. Of course, we're trying to optimize sets and like all that, but like what can marketing control? So, that's fire. I like that. What about you, offer publisher man? What is your official thing now? You've been talking about lots of things. You're talking about leaning in, going deep, going here, there. I don't know what you want to talk about or not public, but do you have uh Oh, we just same thing as always. Just I uh progress. No, I mean for me it's like deeper like we talked about like low ticket. I mean first low ticket or first funnel I ever built for a client was low ticket funnel went on to do over a million in six months and I continued to low ticket and I just didn't really think about it. I didn't go deep just went wide and started stacking skills other places. I was like let me just keep going and obviously I started dou so I started going deeper into low ticket started doing more done hundreds of offers now done all of that but I was like no like there's another level to this like I haven't I need to go even deeper into it. So for me like personal goals is like I just want to be I want to get even better at ascension and like when you think about low ticket it's just financial model. It's it's not like I'm not just thinking about the front end. I'm thinking the full funnel ascension mainly like the just it's a financial model. How do you sell multiple things to one person over a series of time keep them happy? Like it's just that's what I want to get really good at and like leading people up. And so for me I'm just like locked in on that. And so that the nice thing is with my publishing, I mean, we just do low ticket for our people. So it's like the financial model is used in all the deals that I'm publishing and so I get to practice that. And then I'm also doing a lot more consulting on it just to like continue to work things and see data and test it. So, you know, we're we're doing that. We're we're relaunching um one of our low ticket offers for low ticket offers.com meta. Um, and we're going to do that and then just like staying super dialed into it and just like mastering like what is the next like every solution creates a new problem. And so it never starts doing the classic like book a call right after someone buys and what what happens what's next? What's the next meta of ascension? One thing that's working well is webinars. We're doing webinars in it. But I'm like what's next? Like once that stuff what's what's the next thing? How are we going to do it? how like my thought was like you know uh Ian he freaking he sent like a little we were talking about this before like they send out like these little letters right and like should we send these to our low ticket purchaser I don't know like hey by the way like thanks for joining schedule here's a QR code and it costs like twoish $1 so our cost acquisition you know fulfillment goes up by a dollar or two I don't know like but I'm just solely focusing on like how can we just do and then also it's like organic okay how do We continue with all our clients to get them out in our organic cuz status and organic is huge and it it makes your funnel stats look awesome. Other places like one of the things you guys do super well and we've talked about this is you're not just a you're a direct response company but you're not really like you you're not really you have so much we would we would lose in a in a gunfight against a direct response only. Yeah, exactly. But the reason why you're able to sustain and like sell something like you do. So anyways, that's my focus and just that like what's the next step? Cuz I knew I said I was like two or I was like three. Yeah, it would have been three years ago. A year before I got married. I said I was talking to people like what are you doing? I'm like well I'm going to master loia funnels and then the next issue is ascension cuz getting to buy a loia product is not hard. It's how do you ascend them? And so I was like I'm focused on ascension. And now I believe we're in that era where it's like ascension and figure out how to do that do it well is my focus. And then yeah, obviously scaling up across the board, I took, you know, I started hiring, we talked about like I need an operator. I need like a mini me. So I duplicated I'm like 50% there to duplicating myself. Uh the dude I'm working with. He's amazing. Shout out you if you're watching this. Dude, he crushed it. We did internal projects for like one of my offers. So I essentially let him publish me and I said, "Okay, I'm pretend I'm the creator. Publish me." And he crushed it. Like just finished like a massive funnel build. the launch, the emails. I like looked over some stuff. I only changed a few things. He said, "Film this, do that." He did well with project management. He did well at that. And so, he could do the project management and the marketing, which is what I wanted to see. But I want him just in the marketing. So, we also hired a VA to help with project management. And so, now I have an amazing funnel designer who's amazing. Like, I was talking to your CMO today and he looked at one of our funnels and he was like, "Who's your designer?" and now he wants to take him, but I'm not going to let him. Um, but an amazing funnel designer. I have almost a duplicated me. I have a project manager VA and then me overseeing it. So, I'm trying to build a seal team six where I can deploy into any offer. Yeah. And like go for sprint for 90 days to the point where it doesn't need us as much anymore. And then we can either and get to maintenance mode. Obviously, I feel like there's no such thing as maintenance in this game. you're always good, but like no passive income, less sprinting, less sprinting, I guess. You know, sprint for 90 days and you know, so that's our focus now. And so, props to you. Like I love your deeper uh not wider thing. That thing really helped me lock in because like dude, I was about to just like h whatever. Let's get offers. I told you I was going to give Yeah. Anyways, there's a lot of stuff for I was just going to jump ship and do something new. So, I like it. Yeah. keep I keep I mean I send people your way for beginners who want to learn the model and business model to like basically offer publish right but like do the expert business model um people keep asking me and I keep talking about you know marketer expert and then operator once you want to get to the point where you're not just doing launches and making a couple hundred grand or a million bucks and then down to 80% less than that on evergreen basis like you kind of want all three if you're going evergreen you're definitely if you're going to scale of over seven figures a month um but yeah I think it's uh I think it's a good model I think The low ticket thing is always we talk about webinars, we talk about low ticket, we talk about all these things. Everything works, right? Everything works. You'll find some funnel that's been running the same one for 10 years. All like I think that's the biggest thing helped me is detaching from feeling I need one thing. Detaching from believing there's like one right way to do it and be like, "No, I need everything problems." Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "Oh, no, no, we need like people are killing it with challenge funnels. We have to do a challenge funnel." Like yes, there may be some merit in it, but like no, you don't. like you can continue to run one VSSL call funnel and do a lot through it. Like there are ways to do it and then the Dan Kennedy or I think it's Dan Kennedy but like you know whoever can pay the most to acquire a customer wins like at a certain point if you master the other part which is like the actual business which is the LTV which is the actual ascension which is all these other pieces puzzle customer experience. If you acquired 10 customers and it cost you 10 grand a pop or whatever but you knew that like those customers are never going to leave and they're going to pay you forever because you have the stickiest MR thing ever. You would never need to run another challenge funnel or webinar or whatever. Like you want both. You want more acquisition, yes. You want consistent acquisition, yes. You ideally want at a consistent rate, yes. But if this part is crushing and like I'm the first to say this is something that we have not mastered and like why we've been in a pinch at when we're at 1.5 or breaking even or whatever, like if you look at the math, it's not exactly how it works. But like we have not focused on LTV in retention. We're doing another re uh retention generating event right now. Between upsells, downells, between continuity, between other product SKs, like we talked about supplements before, other products, other offerings, we didn't have like dumb dude. We acquired 20,000 customers at a mid like an okay CPA and then because we churned them after a year, it's like there goes the potential to make three, five, 10x more on ROAT, like gone. And like okay, cool. We have a win back pipeline now and you own the data kind of but like holy did we drop the ball and lose 10 30 $50 million on the back over one year or two years let alone if you had these customers for the next 10 years and they paid you two grand or five grand on average a year. It's like like that stuff is so yeah I mean what you're doing I think is great though with the acquisition but I think the biggest thing too is like how do you want to sell and how do you want to fulfill because for me I don't want to build I don't like building sales focused companies where it's callfunnel based so I'd rather do low ticket webinar and like because for me in my own businesses I never really did call funnels I just I like to pull people in and use like more of the math kind of like Eman likes to go to big events like that. I'd rather do that. So me personal like dude, do I know I can make money with call funnels? 100%. Have I done it? Yes, I know it works. I work with companies that do it on low ticket funnels 100%. But just for the things I'm publishing our offers. It's just for me personally, I don't want to optimize that type of company. So I think a lot of people watching this, you figure out what do you want to be responsible for? What do you not want to be responsible for? Build a business around that and then see if you need to compromise in some of the areas where you're feeling picky to grow the business and help more people win. Because there's some ways like you need to like I can't sit here and be like I'm never going to do this cuz I don't want to do it. It's like at some point maybe I will have to do a call funnel if I really want to hit the goals I want to hit and I'm going to have to die to that. So it's it's this weird balance. You just have to figure out what do you want to do and what do you not want to do. So I agree and I think your ICP being people who haven't cracked low ticket like it's a huge unlock that's kind of like a bigger bucket and there's different ways to do low ticket too. It's like it's the concept the cool thing about low ticket I feel like is the concept of the difference between lead leads versus buyers that you're selling to when you get to the next layers. So like that like a challenge funnel versus a webinar versus whatever like I don't those aren't that crazy different whatever like yes you have different consumption yes you have different priming yes you have different economics but like the beauty of low ticket with economics and the the fact that you have now buyers in your system instead of leads is like the big thing. So, you take these guys that only run call funnels as us as an example and you're like, "Oh, cool. I can come in here and build you guys a funnel for 50k or whatever math." Yeah. Uh or percents or whatever. Like, that's a huge unlock for a business. It changes the economics across the entire business. We're we have a a revenue generating event coming up soon for for offer publisher. I'll tease a little bit, but like one of the biggest opportunities we're telling our students right now is the lack of like the issue. People like no load ticket and they don't want to learn it. Like the amount of companies like the offer owner doesn't want to build it. Yeah, dude. Like companies doing millions and millions a month hitting me up air saying, "Hey, we know we need low ticket. We just don't know how to do it cuz I've only done one funnel. We just want to pay someone to do it." And so for people like us, like what we do, we found creators, they have a premium validated offer and like someone like you would be free and low ticket and we say, "Hey, we will build, fund, and run optimize a front-end funnel. we just want a percentage of like the sales that this funnel generates on the back end and we negotiate a deal there. And so we're publishing these experts while owning all the front end and the funnels and everything like that. And so it's like this good balance where it's like we both need each other, but honestly it's like I could replace them on the back end and switch out the face if they really wanted to screw me over, not so it's like there's such a big opportunity there that I consider like the tipping point and it's like we're raising we need multiple funnels and so people like if you're watching this like freelancers agency like that like they will they need people like you and there's a ton of these offrunners that came from Sam Ovens days, traffic and funnel days, clients community days, all these high ticket people that only got tough one funnel that are now like and then and then they got taught school go do low ticket recurring info and now they're like frick that didn't work as well as I thought with info so now they're like where do I go and so they need someone like you someone like me to go out there and do that for them so there's big big opportunity there yeah no info coaching is real right now selling info that's bite-sized and pushing them up into coaching I see the entire market shifting into a lot I mean it already has shifted just an observation I'm making is it's so much there's so much coaching now, so much hybrid, so much like that side of things. And I like it. I mean, I think you can get more personalization, you can get people more results than them just logging into a course that has no community and hoping they get a result. Like, I like it. So, I got a pop. Uh, you rock. Hey, you too. Keep crushing it, bro. Keep crushing. Thanks for not cutting me off. Bye, friends. I think I cut you off like 40 times, which is way better than the initial 50. There's a counter in the comments. Everyone's be counting. I'm not editing this ad counter, but somebody can do that for me. Um, cool. All right. What's today? One something comments on this. We're live on X this entire time, so that's fun. I don't really know. 762 max people. Shout out watching. Nice. Follow Ryan on YouTube. Ryan Clog on YouTube. Check it out. Yeah. Goodbye, friends. Talk soon.

# I’d Do This to Make $77M from Scratch (Live Q&A) | EP115
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfh2iyYisGA

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing our weekly weekend Q&A round 10. You guys submitted all these questions here to the request box over the last week, and today I'm going to answer every single one of them. Looks like we have everything from email and retention to hiring brand faces, percentage of IBIDA you take out of the company at a personal level, uh AI, personalization inside the CRM, all the things. So, I'm sure you're going to find a golden nugget in here. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 78 million in total cash collected. I think it's actually 79, but uh I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool All right, so let's get into it. I think today is day 115 in a row, which is pretty nutty because I was only going to do this for 30 days. So, first one, if you had to start an info coaching company completely from zero with no skills, zero revenue, how would you proceed and scale to 100 to 250k a month? So, no skills. That one's tough. Um because you need the skills. So, zero revenue, that's normal. I talk about this a lot. Um I'm going to have what's today? Saturday. Um Monday, Josh Gavin and I are going to get back on. Um he's kind of the guy for he was uh offerpublisher.com. So, he talks about how to do this, but essentially this business model for info coaching is an expert and a marketer. And then when you kind of get to scale and operator is how is how I like to think about it. A lot of time the marketer can also be the operator. So, your growth operator, you hear growth scale, all that. You basically just need a brand face um that has something valuable to sell. They have good info. They have coaching. They have something valuable that people are willing to buy and then you can sell it through info or through coaching. So, uh a lot of people talk about this model. There's a lot of people out there who teach people how to be growth operators. I like Josh Gavin stuff. Um so, hit him up on something and that's kind of a good approach. But essentially, all you're going to do is model something off that. Create an offer is where you generally start. Um price it appropriately for the market and for what you are selling. Um you know, Bisot, for example, has ROI justifications. So, if you're going to help someone make X amount, you can charge X amount. Uh, I don't really play in that game too much. I've never really played Inbop, but we'll do stuff that's outside of there and use internet marketing and info coaching principles to scale it. So, think about something like vegan or like I know somebody who has how to grow the largest pumpkin, for example, that teaches info and coaching on that um and crushes it. So, you can do it in any industry, but you need to find somebody who either already has an organic audience that you want to boost off of and use. Um, I know guys who do that. Uh, or you just build it around there and then run paid. Uh, which is a little bit more difficult in my opinion, but that's kind of the approach. Next one on here, deep dive for retention channels. Love to hear what you're doing with email, email, SMS, WhatsApp, physical mail, push, and what else you're doing to drive up LTV. Um, so I assume what you mean is then internal. So retention meaning somebody who's already a customer and then sending email, SMS, WhatsApp, physical mail, push. So I actually inquired about this the other day because I think physical mail, I think about this more on the acquisition side than the retention side, but there's actually a pretty good point. Um, right now we just do email and SMS. We have Facebook group. We have some live stuff. Uh, we do some one-to-one calls. We do some group calls. We do stuff like that like inside the community. Uh, we don't actually sell a ton internal, which is the reason our LTV isn't as good as it could be. Um well that's actually because we didn't have offerings nor did we have XYZ let alone communication methods. So like starting with the core thing is like what are we going to offer them and then how are you going to communicate with them? Email, SMS, WhatsApp, right? Um so for us North America so SMS works pretty well. Um email. Okay. Uh physical mail. We're talking about doing this on the acquisition side more so like retargeting through physical mail. Uh we have a 460 year old demo so that would kind of lend itself well retarget um or kind of for our demo right the whole omniresence. Um, so we go multiplatform already for that. Uh, I don't really know what you mean by drive up LTV on that. I talked about that in some other videos on what our plans are. Um, on like basically who else has our customer profile uh, and then how would we either build that into our own business or do it through partnership? And yeah, so that's where we're at. Let's assume you're bootstrapping your product. You have limited funds and one mistake might mean shutting up shop. What marketing efforts are you doing over one a month? and pick three topline metrics you're looking for and what your daily, weekly to make sure you get some kind of positive return. I don't know if I understand this. What? So, what are you doing with marketing doing over one a month and picking three topline metrics you're looking for and what you're doing daily? I would pick one thing and only do one thing. So, you'd have a one source, one offering, one whatever. And you'd scale that up until you have such like a healthy profit margin that you or such, you know, positive cash that you can then test other ones to offset it or try and beat it with better returns. So, I would just do one. So, just do meta, just do one funnel type, just do one offer type, and just optimize it, optimize it, optimize it until it's like printing cash for you. And then you can test out Tik Tok or YouTube or whatever. Um, another good way is putting it into content. So, that also costs I mean, you can do it for free, but doing it through that so you get organic, so you're not just burning cash potentially on ads. Um, that doesn't work. So, organic is just going to take a bit longer. Um, but yeah, I mean, you just don't want to put yourself in a position where shutting up shop is a thing. That's why service based and info coaching is so nice is because it's so lean. You don't need to like shut up shop if you make a mistake because it doesn't take that much cash outlay. You're not buying $500,000 in inventory or 50 grand in inventory or whatever and then trying to sell it only through ads. You're burning cash on inventory, burning cash or not burning cash, but you have cash outlays on inventory. You are potentially then burning cash on ads if it doesn't uh return because it's gone. So that's why people always say start with services. Same thing with like affiliates. like you spend 10 grand a day on ads and then if you don't get sales like you're out. Same with lead genen, same with ecom at some level with ecom. Um, so yeah. Can you talk about how you're creating incredible data and dashboards across every rep setter closer funnel currently generating 1 million a month with three clients, but we don't have anywhere near your level of sophistication in terms of tracking. So when you say you're currently generating a million a month with three with three clients, I assume you're managing three clients that are doing a total of a million a month and you're trying to get clear on their data. So first things first with dashboarding is it comes back to the data. So what data you actually store and how clean it is is then what you can report on. Uh if that makes sense. So basically like let's look at a VSSL call funnel for example. You'll have an an opt-in date. You'll have an app date. You'll have a call date, a call booked on date. So when did they click the button and when is the actual call? Those are flipped but uh when if they showed so like all the outcomes of the call and then the close, right? So you have like essentially all those data points and then you can report across that and you can do it by funnel very easy because it's like okay cool they came in through this funnel. What is the opt to app percentage? What is the app? What are the call uh what is the call cost? What is the live call cost? What is the cost per client? You could run two funnels next to each other and see the cost per client on one is a,000 bucks and it's 3,000 on the other one. You want to lean more spend into this bucket. You scale it up and you find that it starts to break after XYZ or throttles because of this and you can plan back and forth. as an example uh you say rep and setter and closer all of that is then more so on it's kind of like so for example on setter let's use that so a setter will get uh basically be able to claim a lead they claim it they'll claim it at the contact level so a lot of these CRM will have basically a contact a contact will have many deals a contact can have a company so a company can have many contacts and it's all this like relational databases so what'll happen is a setter will claim a contact they will assign themselves as like setter owner of the contact. So now they're in uh in charge of and you can report on the fact that they claim this person. They're in communication with them. And then when they set the deal, they will then also mark themselves as setter owner on the deal when it's excuse me when it's generated. So then you can track which deals have closed, which deals are in whatever stage pipeline that contain that SDR owner and then you can run reports on that. Same thing with the cash collection. And then it's like all the data that exists on a deal. So it's like what happened at the deal level, what stage are they in, how much cash was collected, what was the time between deal creation, deal closed. So, you know, like your rough um time on call to close, all that kind of stuff. So, it really comes down to how you store the data and then trying to have one source of truth, which is an issue for us and we're actually solving for right now. And then having ideally one dashboarding set. So, a lot of people use um HubSpot and like the viewers on that, which are not that good. Uh I don't really like. And then we're using kind of some custom solutions and one custom database. I know a lot of people who use BigQuery and Looker. Uh Looker is pretty slow for me. Um I've heard a lot of people using datab box. data box plugged into whatever database solution, plugging into HubSpot, plugging into a sheet, whatever. Um, but yeah, so you essentially just need clean data, making sure that's consistent across there on the billing side, on the fulfillment side, on the sales side, on the marketing side. Once you have your clean tables essentially of relational data, then you're just reporting off that on one generalized tool so that everyone can use there. And then you can do user specific, you can do team specific, and then you have user, you have databases of users. So you have like STRs all exist in one team, report only from this team across this range, all that kind of stuff. So hopefully that was helpful. Hopefully that was not confusing. Um, how do you use AI to optimize personalization CSM? I assume you mean CRM or content system. I think that means like website hosting too and copywriting. So for us uh the main place we use AI right now which is not enough we use AI AI a lot internal for like summaries for data collection for uh analytics um for like compliance pieces um for coaching for feedback internal but when it comes to like personalization and uh client facing we really only use it on our app notebook sequence. So like what I was talking about you have someone who opts in then they apply then they book a call when they apply they give us their phone number for the first time. So, we don't do it on the front. Between the application and the booking, they will there'll be drop off and fall off. And Jeremy Haynes is going to make fun of me if he listens to this cuz his is like 80 to 100% completion rate. Uh ours is like 50 to 70, let's just say roughly. Um so, we'll have people drop off. So, 100 people will apply in a day. Let's just use easy math. 50 will book. You have those 50 spread that applied but did not book. We will read their application through AI. we have our entire website, all of our resources, all of our everything built into a database um flatten across and then it'll look based on their application, based on the website resources. What are the best resources for that person? It'll grab the best resource. Hey, so and so based on, you know, I won't say based on your application, but it'll be like, oh, I see you've been struggling with XYZ or you tried XYZ. Uh here is a resource on the site. Uh you know, did you get the link? And then it'll have a communication back and forth all with the target of pushing them to a book, but it'll do it through like a qualification. So, it's basically like a AI setter that works through SMS. Um, that's kind of like the core one. We do use some stuff on the back as well on client side that's like duped or like cloned AI voice uh for surveys and pieces of that, but we like say that they are. We don't we're not super fans of like pretending to be through AI, so we don't really do that. Um, but there are a million other layers that we could use this. Uh, we're doing it a lot with automations now. We're moving tons of Zaps over um over to NADEN uh and some other pieces which again is more so like automations. There's like a little inference or infer or whatever um that's happening over there. But yeah, so we could do this more but we don't do it a ton right now. And then how we use it for uh copywriting like crazy. So we'll like crazy. So we'll use it on all the VSSL copy. We'll use it on page copy. We'll do it for complete ideation and then come in and tweak it after. Uh we send two emails a day. So we'll pop those in there and then again we usually come in and like find uh fine tooth them after. Um but yeah, so we'll use them for a lot there and a lot there. Uh, what would you do if you had to make 77 million from scratch? Um, if I was to redo this, I think I've talked about this a lot, but I would probably stay in some version of info coaching. Um, I would definitely lead with paid pony or like basically on top of an organic machine. I would pick somebody that's like a powerhouse or that I see a lot of potential in as an expert and I would build it through that. But I would do it with something with a very large back-end monetization play. So something like I've used many examples of this if you go back and watch videos on the channel uh insurance, finance, stuff in that realm. I think they have massive backends that you can do, things that can plug and play with partnerships, things that can scale. And the other thing that a lot of people don't talk about because it doesn't happen in info coaching uh is exits. So this is also something that if you wanted to build for three to five years and exit and make this instead of making it in cash flow, that's a different game and probably not really my speed and something I shouldn't talk on because I have not done it. So that would be my game plan if I was literally like ran out of everything and was at zero. So uh I've started doing high ticket through a VSSL application funnel. I was also running a free community to paid community prior and continue to do so. Recently implemented the center onboarding call to low ticket. So going to keep pushing that. Yeah, run that. That crushes u but I don't want to be pushing three links from organic. Free, low ticket, high ticket. So maybe going to run free and high ticket only and have low ticket ascension from free. Like your advice. Low ticket is very valuable. So many push to ads trying to work out what's the best from organic. I wouldn't mind having a CTA for my clients but not to coaching students separately funnel. Uh yeah so keep this centralized. So pick like two. So I think on uh YouTube descriptions right now you can fit two links. So we'll have two. We'll have one that's going to the free training that pushes to the VSSL funnel and then we'll have one that goes to low ticket. So we don't have a free community and all of that p I mean we do but like we don't use it on a front end at all. Like it's included inside. So basically someone will opt into the VSSL op uh call funnel. they will then get invited to the community or like push to go do it. Um they'll join inside Facebook and they'll do it there. But we don't have like the proper setup for free to push to paid and all that kind of stuff because a lot of time you'll like exactly what you're saying here free community to paid community. We don't even have that as an offering. So for us it's like going into the low ticket and then low ticket immediately sending into the high ticket. So I would likely just do like what we do is literally push to the low ticket. You have your people that come in as buyers. they come in, you make your 20 bucks or your 100 bucks or whatever your uh low ticket setup is. Uh it's still approachable because the biggest thing with this is like what's the most approachable thing for someone who's living in organic and I don't know what your niche is or whatever, but if they're not ready directly to apply for the high ticket and are like pre-sold already, then yeah, you need consumption. So you either need to push them through something free where they get the consumption. So in our case, it's a free training that then pushes them to apply and book a call to the high ticket, or we push them through low ticket, which instead of being a lead, they become a buyer inside the buyer flow. Then like you said right here, they're doing the onboarding call which then you can ascend them to here. So I likely would keep it as these two or like I don't really know how your free community is structured. Um but if you're getting enough organic like it can likely just push right through low ticket. So you're actually making money on this. A lot of time with low ticket you're doing it to liquidate ad spend to make the economics work. Um but if you can get your free community to do the same thing you'll get more I would assume. So you know get 100 you get 100 clicks to it. what's your take rate on the free community versus a low ticket versus I don't know what you're doing with high ticket but I assume like an application through uh VSSL application funnel so I assume it's that but it's all about the economics so or economics paired with the throughput so just do the math and model it off of if you have a 100 clicks to that page and then determine which one has the highest throughput is generally how I would do it um in the most cost-effective and efficient manner what is the best way to get volume for UGC ad creatives right now I write copy hire someone do Upwork, Fiverr to record the content, then have a VA edit it or do it myself. Feel like it's a very tedious process and I do not have financial means to completely outsource creative ideation and editing for different marketing angles at your scale. What does this process look like? How are people one man shows a big ecom brands effectively? This is funny. So, um Josh Snow has something I'm forgetting the name of it. It's like power it's uh something bet brands powerhouse brands or something along those lines. And I was literally going through their resource section. and they they kicked it up the other day. Um and he was on a live, but they were talking about this and they have multiple websites they go to and I'm sure someone could comment below with some examples. There's complete AI versions of this first of all is one thing. Um if you're like sending product out and you're trying to control it a little bit better, but like first things first is there is definitely AI ways to do this that are like mass scale, uh I'm sure it costs money. We don't do this for ours, so I don't really have exact like personal experience with this. Uh we have brand faces that we have basically brought in house um that we pay X amount and then they create content for us. We have a schedule. We provide them with scripting. We provide them with XYZ. We've you know filtered and trained kind of on how we want the content. They send it back. We have an editor who edits everything and then it pushes over the marketing um to go live uh or to the um media buying team to go live. So that's kind of ours. We don't do like mass ad creatives through UGC. I know a lot of people who do an ecom and they either use AI or they just farm them out on these platforms that are specifically built for this same thing with people I don't know if you're using I don't think you're doing ecom but a lot Oh yeah man code no you're talking about other guys um yeah ecom guys a lot of time will also do this through Tik Tok shop and then be able to take those from Tik Tok shop and use them as ad creatives um so yeah this is kind of not 100% my expertise but you're thinking the right flow I think you just need to probably find a platform that'll have them kind of more direct on them or just use one of these AI platforms. Different people feel different ways about that because like is it real or not? It's obviously not real. Um, but sometimes that's okay. I mean, I don't know. You can play the game how you want. How to get volume with ad creatives. I don't know if this is the same. I feel like this is the same person. Um, so for us, it's literally just mass amounts of scripts and then it is, you know, briefs that go over to the faces to record and then they have, you know, weekly cadences of what they need to record. And then the thing is, you know, you listen to any of the big guys talk about it, like Eddie or whatever, you know, you shoot five hooks, five bodies, five CTAs, and that can get edited out to whatever 125 pieces of content. We kind of do a portion of that. And then the same thing with like once you edit it one way, it's not just your hook, your uh your body, and your CTA. You can then like creatively edit these in different ways to make those go a long way further. You can use B-roll, you can use customer testimonials to layer in, you can do it in different orders, you can do like a lot of different pieces. Um, so that's generally speaking how we get the volume and then once we hit one or we have like good ones that are rolling, we'll scale into those like pretty heavily. So we're constantly testing like rough numbers, let's say 20 ad uh creatives uh a month. Um, but we also have multiple different funnels now. So we'll have different messaging funnels. We have different um call to action types. Some are applications, some are to buy low ticket and stuff like that. So yeah, we definitely have those. Um, how many partners do you have for your info offer currently? And do you guys delegate tasks also? Yeah. Uh, so rankclaw.com not working. Yeah, it's on a www through clickfunnels and it was like a show and I set it up and like frankly I don't really care. Um, so this is what this was and then it's funny cuz I go to that link and then I tweet it and then it doesn't work and then it does work sometime like whatever. So yeah, I likely just need to move this and actually put it somewhere that is stable. I set all this up for like everything which is hilarious but like I just didn't really want to mess with it and didn't really want to move hosting and DNA and like just do all that. So sorry. Uh, how many offers do we have or I'm sorry, how many uh partners do we have? So I was technically the third partner that came in. So two co-founders and then I became co-owner like as technically I was like number four or five on the team I think. I got to find out that number um just so I can say it with confidence. But I was number four or five on the team. Two co-founders had built it. I came in as minority owner. Uh and then as we scaled up into it the roles, responsibilities and ownership has changed. Um so yeah it is us three and then there's technically like prof share um kind of some other stuff in there but yeah it's just really us core three. So, um, our current That's also why I don't talk about a lot of like net net numbers. Like I'm happy to give ranges and I think someone asked down here, but yeah, they do. Um, but I don't just don't like to give exact numbers. Like I talk, you know, already about a lot of stuff and like it's not they didn't ask for me to do this uh at all or ask for this. So like I don't really want to dox their numbers. Like they live their lives how they do. Um, I did make a video that talked about like 77 million in revenue or at that time I think it was 71 million. So I was like 71 million in cash and then how that breaks out. team. I already say that we run very heavy and that we're going for a different goal and that it might being dumb that we're doing it because ours is not a cash flow like juggernaut like some of these guys with 80% margins like good for us is like 30% plus. So we are not even at that right now with everything that we broke and changed and moving everyone to W2 and comp plan stacking and like overhead like we're not even there right now which is like  and I'm like very clear about that. Um but I'm not going to scale into things unless we're above 30. So that's kind of like where I'm at. And scale into things for me is like 5 million plus a month. So that's kind of like where we're at. So I'm char targeting by the time I'm there. Let's say it's five a month. Call it 1.5 um in profit and then scale into that and hold the line with overhead all the pieces. So blah blah blah. But again, I don't want to dox out like percents and numbers and stuff. So uh our current Facebook ads testing strategies test a bunch of angles with different hooks. Find a winner scale spend on this winner and try and create many iterations. On average, we launch four to five new angles in four to five new adsets are good. Uh with one to two KPI, cost per purchase is 20 to 30. So we put each one around $40 a day. Problem we can't find winners. Every time we launch something new, cost per click is good. But then either cost per lead or cost per call is not good. Hook rate is 30%. CTR is this. Some reason we can't find a good cost per lead and cost per like we have or one to winning ads inside our ad account. Call like we have with our one to two winning ads. Each ad set we're only spending around $50 for turning it off. So, that is not 1 to 2x KPI, right? Cost per purchase. I get what you're saying. 20 on this. Um, not sure if it's enough to call it a loser. I need more math on this to give you proper numbers. Um, because all at some rate, at some level, like none of this matters. Uh, it's really dependent on like what your actual core KPI is. So, like if you're saying here cost per purchase is 20 to 30, but then you're saying here you're talking about leads and calls, like a $50 call is like crazy low. So, I don't know what your offer is, but like to back out of the math, like if you get $1,000 cost per purchase, so think about it this way. So, if you have $250 or let's do an easier math. If you have a $100 calls, okay, and you have a 50% show up rate, you have $200 cost per live call, okay? Then let's say you have a 30% close rate. I'm gonna I'm cannot do public math right now. Let's say you have a 30% close rate. Your cost per purchase is what? $600ish dollars. It's whatever that is. It's is um so if you're getting a purchaser for $600 on something that is five grand, like you're in the money, right? So like I don't know if what you're testing in and you said you have two winners in here. The other thing is optimization depending on how you're feeding the pixel and training things. if you have like schedule set and you're getting like $40 calls but like they don't show up at all and they're not qualified um because your schedule isn't cooked correctly then like that's one thing versus if you do purchases and you don't have enough volume but like all of a sudden your cost per call is $800 but one in two close like that's also a game that is very very common that happens in call funnel so I don't really know what you're running so maybe you submit this again um but yeah you're doing the right things I think you need to be able to spend into it I think so what um Arsimo was talking about is how he'll test all of these out individual adsets like you are, he'll force suspend. He'll find one that's a winner essentially, then he'll move them into the uh scaling CBO campaign and then leave those going. Um, but yeah, I think the bigger thing is like also and I don't know your funnel, so I don't know if like time to lead is huge or time to call, time to purchase is huge. Like sometimes we'll have like on some of these ranges we'll have two to four weeks until you they actually like directly back out. So leaving them on low budgets and just like letting them spend into it sometimes work. So, I don't have enough context to like give you a proper answer on this, but um there's many things at play. There's optimization at play. There's what kind of funnel this is. Uh there's what kind of expectations you have around cost per whatever event um that could completely skew this. So, as we're scaling meta ad spend, show rates are tanking. All metrics are the same except show rates. Qualified book calls are not even responding when the closer reaches out. Some of them are literally confirming the day of the call but not showing up. Some things we tried but with no big signs of success. allowing people only book two days ahead. Yeah, 48 hour window is what we found the best with. Uh aggressive reaching out after they book. I'm thinking maybe editing the Kly redirect to a simple video that tells them why his call is important. There's lots of theories out there. Yeah, go into Jeremy Haynes talks about this like extensively. He calls it backend sales systems. There's like, you know, the 12 core things that you can do. You need everything though. So, as you scale into cold traffic, like people are more or less used to these booking funnels now. And like if it is not a good enough offer, if they don't know what they're applying for, if they know they're going to be sold and it's not something that they want to be sold on because in the before the call you promised them free information and then they get on and they see or they Google you and it pops up on Reddit that you're a scam or XYZ. So essentially it's the framing that gets them up to why are they applying and booking a call? It is immediately after what are they seeing on the thank you page as congratulations, you're booked XYZ. Here's the video on what um on what to expect for the call. than common objections and obstacles that come from the classic like all the feedback that you get from sales calls. So you take them from you know objections and you turn them into you know pre-frame obstacles. So what does it cost? What is this? What is that? Then you truly have better qualified people because they've watched these things. It's the communication flow you push them to. It is um you know having someone speed within five minutes and dial them and make sure that they're actually confirmed not just texting them and say yes if you're going to show because like easiest thing in the world like you you want to create some uh you know micro commitments. So you talk to them. Um Jeremy talks about the hammer them strat. So he fires ads at them. All these different ones, long form testimonials, authority videos, um the objection block videos, like all these things that he'll plug in and then hit them with ads in the booking window. So within that 48 hour window, um pushing them back to that page over and over through email or other standalone pages that have other content pieces. Um just a bunch of stuff. So, the biggest thing I can say is the framing prior and the framing after. Cuz think about it, if you didn't reach out to them at all, but they were like so excited or like they really wanted what the offer was, they would show up for the call. So, something is like fundamentally sounds like it's broken here. Um, but like I also don't know your expectations because if you're getting 50% show rates, like that seems to be industry standards. Um, I was looking at a thing earlier and people were getting 38% show rates and doing like two and a half million a month. So, like it can happen. So, and we've even last month was our worst show rate month ever as a global blended number and that's like kind of not true because like the ones that we actually get live, we're now canceling bookings. We're double booking and that's like a true true we're talking like all bookings versus all shows which is not really an accurate metric. Um, I mean depending on how you're looking at it is so hopefully that was helpful. Um, but go watch all Jeremy Haynes content because he talks about this. Um, I'm making 20 to 50K a month right now selling cold email as a service and a little bit of coaching. I've tried everything to grow this, but cold email as a mechanism is getting harder and harder to get results with churn so huge. Um, so our churn is huge and it seems like a feature of an industry, not a bug. I don't want to stick to something that's not producing great results, but at the same time, I don't know how to pivot to something else. Uh, this business is taking 8 to 10 hours a day of my time and making me all my income. How would you go about pivoting and make sure it's not your shiny object? Um, first thing I would ask is, sorry, nicotine. Um, 20 to 50 selling cold email as a service. So what are you doing? What is the result you're actually selling? Cuz you're you're sell this is what you're you know like you said the mechanism of it. But if you can pivot to something that you're still selling the same result and outcome but you use something different so that the churn is not there. Uh that is one good way. So like to pivot you can like full industry pivot you can full to pivot to anything. You could literally do anything. Um but like your easiest way in order to keep this is basically pivot as a mechanism. So instead of using cold email or you know there's terrible potential but like AI in some capacity for this. I don't know what the actual outcome is like cold email as a service. I assume you mean outbound. So getting people lead flow. So like they think they need cold email in order to get them clients. You provide that. But like if there was a better way to get them results or back to this exact example up here is like if your results spoke for themselves then you wouldn't even need to like this would you wouldn't be able to handle the amount of client inflow you have because your your uh results are so good. You would have unlimited referrals. You would have unlimited XYZ because your uh result is so good. Um so yeah, if it's not producing great results, you need to pivot to something that produces great results or you're kind of like sh selling and then of course you're going to have high churn. of course you're going to kind of be stuck in this. So kind of like blunt advice, but yeah, I think really focusing on something that you can be the best at or be, you know, top 10 at where you can get them a really good result. And whether that's through AI to get them clients through XYZ way, whether that's through, you know, I know people doing a bunch of crazy like unique things like AI search, I know people who are doing like only Google ads now. I know guys who are all meta that are all email now. But in terms of like taking existing businesses that are already doing over 100K and like squeezing more things out through automations and SMS, like there's a lot of different ways to do this. So yes, I would pivot. I would hold the line on this so you don't go freaking broke in between, but I would pivot the service offering and just relaunch it. Another thing, you also have all these past clients you can sell to like right off the rip. Uh, which is good because like you've built up a lot of assets in terms of like people and relationships whether even if they turned hopefully they turned well and it was like, "Oh, this doesn't work for us right at this time." And you can do win back campaigns to get them. So like you already have a pool of people you can sell to. It's just coming up with a new offering and something that's really works and results. The other thing you can do is also just offer it to all the current people or all the past people and win back that's free and it's performance based only. I always like selling like that. It's like a no-brainer, right? It's a no-brainer offer. It's like I want to test this new thing that's AI through cold email and XYZ way and uh I'm going to do it for free and I just want 5% of what the uptick is or whatever the math is for what your service would normally be. But they pay nothing out of pocket. you work 16 hours a day instead. You get them a bunch of results. You get to use them as case studies. You funnel that back into the feedback loop at the front. You sell more. You ask for referrals, XYZ. So hopefully that helps. I'm forgetting to breathe today. What types of emails do you send to your email list? Are they value based, testimonial, case study, direct sale, offer, or something? These two. I've sent three emails a week for the last year and open rates are good, but I feel like I'm running out of email ideas and want to minimize repeating ideas so people don't un unsubscribe. First things first, people get hundreds if not thousands of emails a day. Uh you are seeing them all the time repeating. They are not. People need to be reminded not or whatever more so than they need to like learn new things. I'm butchering that, but you understand what I mean. So, we send two emails a day every day forever. So, we have sent we send to 30-day opens and 90-day clicks and then people fall outside of that range. We have a large re-engage campaign that pulls them back in, pushes them back into the open and click world. Um, and yeah, so that's how we do it. And ours are mainly value based and testimonial case study based. We will do the occasional because the majority of those that are sitting on there, we just uh need to either push them to application or push to book depending on the flow or depending on the um segment that we are sending to. Um but the mo majority that we send to are going to be testimonial, case study, uh value based. We push them back to the site. So the core of this is actually we're constantly producing new content that exists for uh middle and bottom of funnel that goes onto the website. We push them to there and then when you push them to there, they then land on the site. They get caught in kind of the flow and like then can go on the site, find other videos, find other things that are interesting to them and then every page has an application uh CTA on it. So then it pushes them back in to apply and book a call. Um, so then you know we have people who have been on the list for two years then apply, book a call same day and purchase because they get an email, they click on it and they've gotten two emails a day every day. Uh, we send from the brand face email. Um, some people do it from the brand company. Um, but we found better results when doing it from the expert. So hopefully that helps. And then yeah, you are going to get unsubscribes, but like at some level you kind of like want that. You want to get you don't want to not pay for those people and you want the list to be clean and only be people that are buyers. Um because if you are trying to email them only a couple times then they already are forgetting about you. So you'd rather be top of mind uh or get the people who unsubscribe because they're not interested in your product anyway. So how much percentage of EBIT do you take out of the company on a personal level every month or quarter? Do you even do it? I find it difficult to talk about this with anyone because nobody wants to talk about finances. I got you. Uh we normally do monthly salary for three of us about 120k a year and I have no idea how much percentage we just put in our holding to take chips off the table 50% of profit split across three owners monthly or more. We used to do yearly dividend payments basically. I feel like that frequency is too low. Yeah. Okay. So this is going to completely depend like I have no context. I like the percentages. That's a little bit cleaner but like 120k a year. I have no idea. So let's use some simple math. Let's say you're doing a h 100,000 in profit, true true profit every single month. Let's say, yeah, let's just say that. So, you're doing like 1.2 million in profit across the year. What a lot of people I hear a lot of people talk about this differently in cash flow businesses, in info coaching businesses, there is no like Iman talked about this. There's no like reinvesting that's actually happening. Like there's working capital. There is stuff that goes into payroll. There's stuff that goes into ads. Like if you're truly spending on ads a dollar and getting five out like over the x amount of term, call it whatever 30 days or 90 days, like yes, you need to keep that cash in there. Yes, if you want to double down on ads, you need to keep more cash in there, but like you have your return payback period and if you don't, you're just putting money in to lose it or to churn the same money back around. So like for for the long time we did quarterly because we same way didn't understand the math or like always didn't want to be like caught holding the bag. Um, and then we actually probably leaned too far in the other direction. We were like pulling a lot of it. Um, like a lot a lot of it. And, uh, we moved our cadence to monthly. Um, so we'll do monthly. We'll look at the thing. Let's call it I just want to use simple math, but that was the example I said 100k in profit. Um, so let's say your payroll, your whatever your fixed expenses are, I don't know, 50 grand. So you leave like a 100red in the in the bank, let's just say. Um, and then you pull the rest. So pretty simple. You do it, you know, five or 10 days after the month depending if you have coaching versus uh info. Info you sell login access, you know, what's your fulfillment period, what are your future costs against that? Because the other thing is if your acquisition stops tomorrow, you stop generating new cash, how much cash you need to have in the business to continue to fulfill on everything or pay for whatever things in terms of overhead or fulfillment that you still need to because you either need to close down shop and just pay off fulfillment or you need to have that cash in there. So, you either need to generate it or put it back in. So, like I don't like the idea of ever having to put it back in. Once it comes out, it's out. Um, so as long as you're running lean and you're running, uh, you know, you know, your numbers, I don't see an issue with doing it, you know, basically leaving safer side, two to three months, risky side, two to four weeks of cash flow that you need or cash inside the banks, so inside the bank account. So yeah, uh, hopefully that answers that. Um, and then there's other structures and ways to do this like salary wise, like we don't even touch these. We only do it through um, we only do it through distributions. Um, so we'll only do that. Uh, we do have whatever obviously team and stuff that makes their payrolls. We do bi-weekly payrolls, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, hopefully that makes sense and then feel free to message me about this if you have like some weird situation or case situation because I don't want you to pull your money out and then be caught and then have to put it back and like weird taxation and all that. So, you can message me. Uh, email and retention. I have no idea what you mean. I feel like I've talked about a lot a lot about email and a bit about retention. Retention for us, they're already existing clients. It's not really like win back campaigns to get them to buy other stuff. Uh we are actually kind of starting to focus on that because we have call at 5,000 plus that were high ticket customers that then ended their term and did not renew. So those are ret uh churned high ticket. So we're doing things through email uh and call outs to bring them back through win back and retention. Can you explain the idea behind marketer expert expert operator split for info businesses and their role? Yes. So my theory on this is essentially you can start one of these up the Josh Gavin way and it's like offer publisher, right? You have an uh you have an expert. So you have someone who is a let's use a good example. You have someone who is a tax pro. Absolute tax pro. Has a local shop does their thing. They have all you know they're trying to create YouTube or you know content online. They're doing YouTube videos. They know everything about all this stuff. They just don't really have like the positioning. They don't have an offer. I don't have whatever other than, you know, go to my website and they have this shitty form and it's like book it and then oh yeah, if you're not in whatever range I can't, I don't really have a service for you because you come into my office and you meet and do whatever. So the marketer can come in who has a little bit of operator skill sure but like really is a marketer at core with some entrepreneurial skill which is different than operating skill and they will then build an offer around this person that is a 10k whatever taxation audit study all this course creation uh all this course content a group around this they'll do twice a week coaching calls where people can come in and ask any question they specifically target small business owners that do between one and 10 million in revenue in whatever niche of things they help them create their ICP they help them create their offering and then they actually help them sell it. So then they help them create ads. They help them create content. They push people to this thing. They sell a low ticket thing that ascends or they sell some high ticket thing through a VSSL call funnel. They script it. They whatever and they build this entire model and then they generally speaking can own X percentage of it. The tax one's kind of a problem. Like not a problem, but like that one's going to be a little generally speaking harder because that kind of person has like this whole business. So you only get money on the info coaching. But the beauty of that model is they make so much more money because they have recurring tax clients. They have referrals to estate attorneys. They have referrals to insurance. They have insurance or uh referrals to XYZ. So like that one's kind of wonky because it's like how do you get paid as the marketer? It's very easy to spin it up and get 50 70 80% whatever number of the actual info coaching business that you're creating with them as the expert, right? Like that's going rate. If you have experience, you can get 50% of the company all day. If you're not experienced, you get 20%, let's say. And then the person gets 80%. You build the whole thing around them. And then you do this. Once you get to a certain scale, you are no longer pumping an offer. You are building a business. And when you have a business, a lot of marketers are not fantastic in the entrepreneurial way. They're great with ideiation. That's how they were good at this. That's how they're great at creating the offers and all this like design and copy and whatever. But they cannot they don't have the skill set as well as uh as much as the skill set they have of that. They don't really have that in terms of operating. So that's when it comes in uh project management, operator, co whatever titles. But you have someone who thinks more system based and can go, "Oh, okay, cool. We're doing 200k a month with this. How do we take this to two million? What are the constraints? What is the system? What do we need more of? What is what are one-time projects? What are recurring projects? What kind of people do we need in place? How does the math work for the comp? Are we building this to sell? And if so, we need XYZW2 and this team and reduction of this risk and whatever versus global team and you know, gunslinging and being able to do that with crazy high margins. So like an operator more so person is going to do that. than the marketer and the expert. So hopefully that makes sense. Um, how do you go about hiring co uh contracting brand faces in detail? Um, so for us, I know a lot of people who have done this a lot better than us. So I don't know if I'm really the person to ask. Um, but ours was we just found them uh online who already had kind of personas around the niche we're targeting. We're not using their organic presence. We literally are using them for who they are, their uh expertise in the niche, their physical appearance because for us it is phys, you know, it matters for that. um because again we're in fitness uh and kind of hit XYZ check marks are a good person are cool you know we want to hang out with them and then we structured um you know comp models basically in alignment with that um for just deliverables so same way that you pay someone UGC and you'd pay them whatever thousands um for this then you do this um other people do you know different models but for us we needed multiple brand faces we tested them through ads so initially we ran to the same core funnels just with them as ads saw how they performed at the ad level and then also obviously the throughput level um but mainly how do they perform on ads. Then the next phase of that is launching them their own funnels. So their own VSSLs where then they then bridge over post VSSL and bridge into the main company for application booking all that and then the next next iteration is using them uh inside low ticket products uh and then selling through that and then having the ascension funnel. So using those three kind of core layers. So just as ads to start. So you just have them as ads. You run to your core funnels. Are the metrics good? Does it resonate? Is it cool there? Then introducing them on the ad level and the VSSL or whatever funnel level. Did those all back out? Did these have good stats or VSSL good? Whatever. And the next layer is creating actual products around them that exist within the catalog and suite within the company. Um, and then other people will bring them through and have them as group coaches. Uh, we'll have them inside community calls. We'll do stuff like that. But ours is kind of like a pass off. It's like a I partnered with I'm a brand ambassador for type thing. Not like I'm a coach uh in our example. So, uh, yeah, and then the comp kind of tears as those things happen. So, it's like, okay, we just need ads, that's like one thing. We need VSSLs, that's like another thing. And then we need info products, that's like another thing. So, all of them with having weekly, monthly, whatever, deliverables around ads, around VSSL splits around um, not really around products, but like kind of around products just to do buildouts. So, hopefully that makes sense. I'm trying to balance heavy outreach, my main revenue driver, with content creation, client delivery, and team management. I sometimes watch movies or entertaining videos on the side while I work, not brain rodder movies, but I'm wondering sometimes watch movies or entertaining videos on the side if it's hurting my focus. How do you structure your day for maximum pro productivity? Do you even believe in complete focus during work hours or some background entertainment okay for some tasks? What's your framework for deciding what deserves 100% attention versus you can multitask? Oh man, am I not the person to ask this question? Uh, I have two monitors. So, I have these two set up right here. This I try and only use for like referencing. So like I'll have like stats over here or if I'm like looking back and forth for this and this. But man was there a time I mean I lived in uh for three years like you know freaking isolation basically and was just at my computer like 18 hours a day like no joke. Um was not the best. And I also that's not even true cuz when I was working it was that but then I was also like off and just going like partying and like traveling and  but like when I was in pocket that's how I would do it. I would have this set up right here and then I had it was in a living room and then I had a TV in the back and I would literally be doing stuff and I would have like shows running like I've seen every single show  possible on Amazon Prime or Netflix and I don't even seen like I basically have no idea what happened but I would do it for like the audio. Then when I got a little smarter about it, I would turn on like uh long form podcasts. So I've learned a ton of stuff through there. So I'll turn those on and I usually just do it on this one. I don't do it as much anymore at all honestly. Um, but right now I bounce around like, "Oh, I'm doing this for thing for X or personal brand." It's like, "Oh, I'm doing this for main co." And then it's like, "Oh, I'm doing this for whatever." Meetings. I'm like in meetings. I try my absolute best to not do anything while on a meeting unless it's like completely doesn't need me to be on there. I'm there for like one piece and then I'll work and then I'll like pop back in. Um, but yeah, I mean, that's definitely not focused. I also have heard and looked at the stats and multitasking is not a thing. It's like your brain's focused on this or it's focused on this. So, it's like background noise is one thing, but true like multitasking is not really a thing, especially when you're not doing educational or whatever things. Um, so how do I structure my day? Right now, it's a show if I'm being blunt. Uh, it used to be really dialed and my like favorite for me is like my 5:00 a.m. to like 8 a.m.ish is like nobody with me and it's like my dream. So, I can come in here, I can have coffee, I can do my thing, I can look at random stats, I can explore this, I can inbox zero, I can, you know, set up the task list. Usually I was doing it the night before. Uh what my like main core things I die by the calendar. So if it makes my calendar, it happens. My issue right now is I'm not like putting things on calendar. This whole like YouTube video a day plus this plus this for like 80 or 90 days of 70 or 80 days of this I was like dialed and then it kind of got like shot out of a cannon where it's like oh  I got to do my video or like oh I'm doing this and I have opportunities flowing to me like like river. Like it is insanity the things that come to me. So I'm like I've basically denied everything. Um, but like it's a lot of my brain power right now because it'll be like very attractive things and big names that you know and like I just have been like trying to protect the brain but then also be like oh am I missing out? So I'm like okay cool I'm willing to help but like I don't really want to do it for comp because if I do it for comp then then that requires like me to be full in because I'm not going to do something for 100 grand and not help someone make you know 500 grand or whatever. So I'm doing this whole structure right now. Um, and I've also been doing dancing with some of like the personal stuff more. Went on the bachelor party trip, whatever, two weeks ago. Um, spend more time with girlfriends, spend more time with family, like do that kind of stuff. Uh, because I was kind of like, relatively speaking, an for a minute because I was like 98% in my work. So, but my best day is 5 to 8 a.m. kind of like in pocket. 8 a.m. basically everyone's awake and doing stuff. Uh, live by the calendar. I'll have meetings roughly from 8 to noonish. I'll go to the gym. I still go to the gym every single day no matter what. no matter what. Um, I'll do that and then I come back and then that's usually like podcasty YouTube whatever time and then sometimes I'll have meetings between two and five depending um and then I will then either do the YouTube video then I'll go to uh dinner then I have you know mobile for everything else but a majority of the time is sat here um I don't know if I'm answering your question but maximum productivity for me the best ways has been structuring the day fully not deviating from it. So if you say you're going to build XYZ website in this 2-hour block, get it  done. It is planning that out the day prior. So like end of day planning it out. Doing your like actual goal setting I find helps. And if you actually review it, like kind of sounds stupid, but like actually reviewing it. Um the gratitude thing like I try and find moments for that and be like look at where I'm at now. This is crazy. 110 days ago I was literally living in a cave. had no friends, had no whatever inside this world and now it's like literally like exploding at the seams. So like I try and find moments for that. Um but yeah, so hopefully that was helpful, but I don't really know if I'm the person. There's productivity gurus who all they do is that. Um I just like my coffee and stims and having fun and problem solving and So I've been working with a YouTube agency for several months and delivering good results, but I feel like I'm forgetting to go back to the basics and miss small optimization opportunities that can make their YouTube even better. Sometimes client point things out that I should call first. O I feel this. Do you have a framework for consistently delivering for clients? Is it a focus issue? Do I need better systems? How do you make sure you're always operating your highest level for clients and not missing small things? This is like same thing as this. It's like you need to be locked when you're locked or you need to have redundancies in place to make sure that when you're not. I made a video about this yesterday or the day before. It was about phases two days ago about phases and like I've had moments where like I have dropped the ball because I've like not been focused and it is like for me the shittiest feeling in the world. So same thing with me saying like I'm not going to take you know people offering me 100 grand, 500 grand, whatever these things like if I don't get them 5x 10x that then like I would rather die or like not sleep until I figure it out and help them. So, for this you either need uh I think it was AMD who came in here and talked about this, but he kind of did the Mr. Beast thing where he had somebody shadow him completely and then literally just be next to him in every video, I'm sorry, every uh every Zoom, every meeting, every work day, all his stuff for x amount of time until he had essentially like a right hand that could come through and do this. So, he did it through systems people. Um but you in the interim until you kind of have that, yeah, it's 100% a focus thing. like you're clearly like spread too thin or not catching details. So creating checklists of oh did I do this then having a VA go through and go through the checklist or you having to go through and do the checklist like it's all about scaling through systems people and that piece of it. Um so you can continue to do this highest level of work because you want to have the highest level of work no doubt. Um and that's how you lose clients and churn and stuff like that which then you have to acquire new customers. We all know the cost and time and whatever comes along with that between time and money. Um so you want to keep clients. So you want to make sure you are operating at your highest level and you show up. And then also people are people too. So like people know that happens and people  up like if you have a good relationship with them and you're not a robot when you talk to them. Um so yeah I mean there's obviously some leniency in here but hopefully that was helpful. Focus real fu money mindset and how their mind algorithms and thinking how their mind algorithms and thinking processes. I think about this a lot. Uh I don't have this um yet. So I have made good money for sure. Uh, and I know people who have made way more money and there's this comparison game and there's all these things, but I don't necessarily have this yet. Um, I do have the belief, my friends and I talk about this a lot actually. I have a I have one friend that let's call him Bill. I have a friend Bill who makes  you money and uh local person like just a good friend that I have had throughout XYZ time um and just has you know the mightest touch has made things work has just like the most confidence in like all the ways around all of this stuff um everyone has their let's just be clear about that so whether it's me whether it's that person whether it's a million other people they all have their own personal things going on um but like around this portion it's like can buy anything you know obviously ly not anything but like anything uh has the confidence for me. It comes back to the self-confidence in yourself which is the biggest thing which is done by saying you're going to do something either to yourself or publicly and then doing it. So if you know that you're going to wake up at 5:00 a.m. every day and you are waking up at 6:30 and you're waking up at 8 like it's a little loss to yourself and those compounds so  heavy. If you are like, "Oh, I'm not going to drink for the month." And you drink two like six days in because your friends are having some thing. You lost a battle with yourself and like your confidence tanks like slowly and then quickly. And if you can't trust yourself, you can't do that anywhere and then people won't trust you. And like it's this really big compounding effect. And like I've had major issues with this in the past um and I'm still working out of it. But like the real fu money mindset is like you have so much like it doesn't even matter, right? Like you have so much confidence in yourself to generate it, to spin something up that you know that like if XYZ went to zero, like you could make it back because the skill set you have in your brain because the skill set you've acquired over XYZ time or years, you have XYZ assets that produce this that like you're safeguarded and shielded, you know. Um there's a lot of people in the online space or a couple people I can think of directly in the online space who like actually have this that I've met personally. Um but yeah, it just I think really comes from just compounding over time. And again, I'm not I don't I should not be the person answering this in terms of like me as a person. I can just show you what I have seen and like friend Bill for example like all of a sudden it's like oh this real estate deal or oh this thing that spits off 100 grand a month or oh this other thing or like oh yeah it's compounding at 30% a year and like just constantly doing stuff in that realm and sure can have all these other things going on in life but like that part of it has unlock so like has so much confidence in self that like if it all went to zero could just spin it up tomorrow could spin it up tomorrow and also has a confidence that it's not going to go to zero because they are so diversified and they're so like all these ways. So think processes are big. Think processes are another big one is that like it doesn't always have to be hard. Like I'm trying to think I think it was Bob Proctor talks about he's like it should it can be easy. Like it can be so easy and like you see some of these guys who make like 500 grand a month and it's like you know respect to them clearly they're doing something right but like are not necessarily you know sharpest tool in the shed type vibes. Um but like it doesn't matter because it doesn't have to be hard. Like we're playing this game on hard mode like in a lot of stuff we're doing and sometimes we're like what are we doing or like why or like affiliates and lead genen like those guys crush like they have some they're crazy like technical and in the detail whatever and then you meet one that has like way out here and like is in that portion like doesn't have similar traits as that as like a lot of the other guys do but still crushes it and it's like their frame on it. It's like oh it's not that difficult. It's like, oh, I already have some media buyers or like all these guys are like crazy in the weeds of ad accounts for 18 hours a day and this guy's like, "Oh, I have two media buyers." And like, "What do you mean?" And like, "I just do biz deals." And it's like there's just different frames to look at things. And like you said, I'm thinking processes. I'm probably not the person to ask this, but like yeah, you can just see it's it more comes down to that part. The thinking processes, the um belief, the self-confidence you have in yourself, and something I'm actively like every single day working on like 100%. So, I'm trying to do it through stacking wins. I'm trying to do it through stacking like saying I'm going to do something and doing it. Saying I'm going to do a video a day and doing it and there are costs to that and  that I've messed up because I have stayed true to myself to do that instead um of other things. So if I operate multiple faceless Instagram theme pages with millions of followers and have success on Tik Tok plus YouTube, can I help coaches consultants grow their IG and get paid a high ticket price since they would get more eyes on their offer? Hopefully bring sales. Um, I know some guys um relatively that are like local that crush with this and I need to reconnect with those guys because they like crush. So, I know people who have done really big numbers with these. I know people who have sold these um not personally actually. I don't personally know the people who have sold with these, but they're like, you know, friends of friends um that have sold massive pages. So, I don't know. I mean, I don't know that you should distract yourself by trying to sell info coaching to people for a high ticket price. I mean, like maybe some like massive price that's just like fun for you on the side to like do XYZ. Um, but I think more so I would just lean into this. Like if you know how to do this, this is different than this. This is like content generation and like scripting and like cadence and editing and distribution and matching it to the offer and then the offer is not right for what the audience is and then going back and then like scaling the offer and then trying to do that. Like if you stay in your bucket and just like oh I'm going to help them grow on Instagram. Like okay. I've seen people who go kind of this model where it's like they're framed like this, but they're a coaching consultant and like I'm sure it works, but then they need like massive setter teams and stuff like that inside there. So, or you just grow these and like you know, I I saw guys that were posting on X the other day that are doing millions a year just from having faceless accounts. Um, specifically YouTube. Um, but then same thing with like shout outs and like having small teams that they were running for Instagram pages. And again, guys have sold these for tens of millions of dollars. So, I don't know. My personal opinion, I don't have a ton of experience with this, but like would just be to grow these and continue in your lane, scale them, get multiple more of them, grow upward in certain ones. Um, and then yeah, sure, if you want to help some certain people do it, but like no, it's a different beast. Um, because that's different than phaseless. Last one. I'm a 20-year-old running a YouTube marketing agency for AI and SAS companies. YouTube marketing. Okay. Currently at around 3 to 5,000 a month in revenue. In three weeks, I'll be in Dubai for a week and want to use it as a network opportunity to connect with people doing bigger things. the way I can fathom what's really possible I put my head down and work as someone at my stage. How would you approach networking a city like Dubai? What types of event should I attend? What's the best way to add value to higher level entrepreneurs when I'm still building myself? I've been solo traveling Southeast Asia but I feel like Dubai trip might open some big doors. Um, again probably not the person to answer this. Um, I went to Dubai for like a conference and I went completely alone and I met no one and I barely left my hotel room and I'm like introvert and like this is not my speed. So I probably not the person asked this. Uh other people all they do is do this. They go to every event. They know everyone. They're connected through the nth degree. They meet someone who opens the door to 10 more people and then through those 10 people each person 10. Now they got a hundred and like they do that. That's not really my speed. Um I also don't even know how I'd approach going to like a random city and trying to do it other than using a social network or presence I already have. So like right now like I'm going to Miami in a week or two or whatever. I can tweet now, which I could not do a 100 days ago, FYI. Um, but I can tweet now and be like, "Who's in Miami or like let's do a dinner in Miami this date?" DM me and then like try and put together a dinner and then so and so will bring so and so. We went to London um for Eman's event and then met some people there. They had some friends, went to a dinner there, they had some other friends, went and played paddle, went and got breakfast, then went to some big dinner. they brought more friends and like next thing you know we've got like five 10 guys that are super cool and we had like a great time and like everyone's crushing it in their own lane in real estate versus uh info coaching versus uh gym like just all these other entrepreneurs that like I would have never met uh business partner is way better at this and he'll go and like meet people at the sauna at the gym network about this then get dinner with these guys they bring their four friends he brings one of his friends then they go out and they meet you know up with another 10 people that they meet out and like they do that like that's not really my So only thing I have is my pretty close connections like business-wise like very close connections that business partners that turn friends or like business connections that turn friends. Uh or I have like core friends and then now I have all the stuff that exists on mainly X and some on Instagram because people chat like message me a lot on Instagram but I don't really use it for like the actual platform other than messaging um currently and then yeah people who like watch YouTube videos and stuff. So that's all I have. Um, and I've made some good connections with the people I've talked to through the YouTube videos, which is great because I basically made 50 60 videos a day. So, that was all about me. Uh, how would I do it? I have no idea. Uh, I would do it through social in some capacity. I don't know if there's already events. Like, for example, I went to the affiliate world or something like that in Dubai. So, like I went for an actual conference and then you can meet people in those because they're built for networking. There's literally like networking rooms. Same way that if you go to, you know, lead genen or whatever that is, the affiliate southwest and you go to Vegas, like everyone goes to the chandelier bar. You go there, you order some drinks, you hang out, you run to the person next to you, you're nice and friendly and have XYZ experience, you get to meet so- and so, they introduce you to 12 more people and like it just begins. So, it's really about like what room are you in and obviously Dubai has a lot of those. I do not personally I'm not like privy to knowing them. Um, so I don't really have like oh go to this restaurant and hang out here and that's where everyone cool goes. Like that's also kind of a weird vibe if I'm being honest. you kind of want to like be in a place that's built for networking like a conference or you want to meet people socially or like through social media, meet up with them and then go from there with the web of connection. So hopefully that was helpful. 56 minutes daily update. I don't know. It's a freaking holiday weekend. So we're only at what 45 grand on the day, 75 yesterday, which is bad because we've been doing 100 plus a day steady. I am hoping for a record month this month. We're going for four to five. I'm pressing for five. So I got to bet. I gotta win. So, daily updates go here for doc. Hopefully, this works. You need the www or it doesn't work because of my shitty ClickFunnel setup. Tech, ops, marketing, sales, mindset. All the videos are here and logged on Monday 115 in a row of doing these. And then the other one is the Rolodex, this this. See, I told you the website works, guys. Um, this I have connects with all these people. Uh, and again, they may pay me, they may not. I haven't been paid by anyone just to be 100% clear, but they might if I just do a bunch of stuff. Um, I've got marketing vendors, sales agency vendors, different deals and stuff with HubSpot, clicks, whatever. I don't really care about this actually. It's not really that important to me. Um, but yeah, so you guys can go there if you want and I'm down to connect to you as long as you Instagram message with context. I appreciate you guys. Drop some comments. I like these videos. These are the, you know, I don't know how to answer certain ones that are like these, like I don't really get it. Um, but when there's context and they're not a complete mile long, like the people who submit one that's like the whole page, uh, I think they're helpful and I hopefully help I hope you can find some golden nuggets in them that are valuable for you guys. All right, I appreciate you and I will talk to you tomorrow. I think I got a good one tomorrow. I think I got some uh some funny guys who have a very large business I think I'm do tomorrow. So talk to you guys

# Made $2,962,140 Last Month… Here’s How | EP111
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy2Q7SQBrsQ

We made $2,962,140 last month in our info coaching business, which frankly is not good. And I'm going to break down what went right and what went wrong in marketing, sales, fulfillment, tech, finance, and ops. We're going to walk through the different marketing funnels, which ones are working, which ones are not working, and what we're doing to change them. And then we're going to go through the team efficiencies we found, how we're growing the team, and the overall org chart. I promise if you are scaling anything in info coaching, you will find a golden nugget in here that will be valuable to you. All right, last year we did 30 million in cash collected in this business. We've now crossed over 78 million. I think it's actually over 79 now uh in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is just for me to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale this business to over 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. Took this screenshot just before this. Um, so this was through yesterday. Today's July 1st. This is the entire month of June. 2.96 mil uh in cash collected in our Stripe account. All right. Now, I'm going to start with marketing on this. If you've seen other videos on the channel, you've seen me kind of talk through these. We're going to talk about what went right, what went wrong. Um, so starting with marketing in these pieces, the biggest piece of what's happening with marketing for us is or kind of overall with the entire department. So over here, we can walk through the department first. Um, so we have a CMO that is newer to us. So call it I believe it's three months now. Um, so he now leads this entire marketing department. In here we have a creative creative director that up until kind of more recent has more so focused on distribution than the actual front-end portion. Uh, ideation creation, a video editor. Uh, this this is actually brand new to us. This is like a full-time senior video editor that crushes with VSSLs and all that. We've always outsource that in the past. So, we now have one in-house so we can do constant uh, iterations and split tests. We have an editor that does all of the content uh, and a lot of the ads as well, or actually all of the ads as well at this point. Um, and I have other videos where we talked about the growth of this change and like kind of where we're at right now, but a graphic designer that came in in the last uh quarter. I'm going to talk a lot about quarters because the end of Q2. So, graphic designer that came in in the quarter, brand face lead is our top brand face co-founder. Um, so she is still in a majority of both the front and back end in terms of the products like info products on the back and then a lot of the front-end uh marketing as well. um a lot of the organic and then now we have brand faces that I will get to talking about but these exist in the ads and VSSLs. So we are diversifying the front end and as well kind of as the middle uh of the company so we can have multiple brand faces for diversification for um you know uh reduce founder risk as well as just match and match with the target demo a little bit better. Media buyers we have metedicated it's actually like one division or one person um but really there's kind of like two within there. So one actually does media buying, one's kind of the higher level guy. Um, and then we have a Google media buyer that's direct. And then we have a content copywriter that is an OG that has been with the company since we had like 15 20 people. Um, and then a senior copywriter that is more focused on uh ideiation and kind of more parts of the paid copy. So more stuff that exists within email uh landing page you know copy like that that exists within um kind of like organic piece of it more so content truly. Uh and then senior copywriter lives in the paid side. So this is the marketing team. Now, within marketing, we ran 71 million through this funnel. Oops. Uh through this funnel right here. This is an opt-in VSSL funnel. So, running majority meta-spend. Um some Google definitely all obviously like retarget brand, all that. Um but then a little bit of cold now is through Google and YouTube, but a majority is through meta. Ran it as an opt-in. Um so, uh name and email coming through here. Watch VSSL. Uh cookie button or whatever you call it, delayed button until the CTA. All the automations and stuff behind this. If I filled this with automations, this page would go forever. Um, but going through the VSSL, pushing them over to an application, fill out an application, go through a router, they either land on a qualified booking page, fire the pixel, uh, book on with the top closers, all that, or they land in the DQ, which is about 50 or 60% are DQ in accordance to what we have for the quality routing right now, and then land here. And these will go with newer closers, uh, or kind of like the the middle tier closers. success page primed thank you page setter will call them to confirm I'll talk about changes we're making around this and then go over to a closer to close them to where their purchase okay so this core funnel right here is what has been responsible for 71 plus million before we even launched other funnels all right so when we decided so like overall focus-wise and like department uh strategy we wanted to diversify we needed to diversify because we pressed this one too hard okay and when this happened last year and it broke it was because we had all of our eggs in one basket and we're focused all on this and didn't have other funnels back uh in the backup or this VVS as our uh CMO calls it the value vortex system. So now we have multiple VSSL opt-in funnels. These different color one up here is what I'm identifying as other brand faces. So we have one brand face with multiple messaging and then we have another brand face and another one in the queue uh with their own stories with their own pieces, their own messaging pockets uh just with them in the ads and them in the VSSL and then it branches over here into the company when it turns into the application booking all that flow. Okay, so we rolled these out. We also rolled out a DTA which is the most classic way that most people run these. So that exists and then low ticket ascension. I'm not going to break all these down. I have tons of videos on the channel where I talk about these. Now, the biggest issue is just that we completely kind of like lost focus. So, we're running all of these and while they're all working, the data around it and understanding what to lean into and just kind of like common sense might be the wrong phrase, but looking into which one of these is truly standing out as getting the best cost per live call because that's essentially what you're controlling here. Like yes, it's cost per sale, but it's also like when you're trying to throttle for availability because that's generally speaking what your kind of like pinch is and your constraint when it comes to the marketing side of things is like obviously the cost, obviously all these pieces, but when you're like ramping into something, you need to know which one of these buckets do you want to lean spend in that can continue to scale up that has the best cost per live call and the best cost per sale. Okay? And we haven't really been focusing for a long time. We've just kind of been focused on cost per call and then cost per purchase and making sure that we can like thread that needle. But between optimization and different funnels, what we're starting to find is the like show rate differences. For example, like we knew it was going to be bad on this, pretty bad on this uh creative testing where we're optimizing for schedule or something earlier in the funnel instead of sale or purchase. Way worse show uh show rate. We have different messaging funnels that like are like so this one for example the messaging in this by the time that they apply it is just not in resonance with what happens on the success page what the messaging is on the back end. If you go watch my interview with Jeremy Haynes he talks about backend sales systems and how a big focus of what's happening over there is priming the person so hard that your closer is essentially just a cashier. Uh and that is just not something we've been doing at a good enough level. Um and that has differed across VSSLs. So we'll have different different ones have different show rates, have different uh expectations, have different framing, different CTAs, all of that. And so we are getting back in alignment with that and really just trying to nail we have this one as the core and we're trying to nail one of these as the main lead funnels and then also this low ticket ascension funnel. Again, I don't really want to talk through this whole thing because I don't want to waste a bunch of time. There's other videos on the channel. Um but this low ticket ascension funnel has the best economics, the best show rates, the best priming for a closer. The issue is that we can't scale into it because this cannot take it through paid in the same way uh on cold traffic. So it can only get up to x amount of scale before generally or like you know basically saying that it uh the net CPA slips once we get to a certain size. So what we are focused on in marketing now into this future and kind of where things I don't want to say broke cuz like it's working but it's not working at the level or at the cost per acquisition like target we want and cost per acquisition is a function of marketing and sales right so like if they both can take responsibility fully then you have like you know 1 plus 1 equals 5. So marketing is what can we do in framing messaging to keep the cost per live call down but the quality so high, the show rate so high um that the math is just insanely good. Um and then also the closer job is so easy and then figure and then solving for that. So really it's what can we nail with one uh one funnel that is a buyer funnel and what other than the core funnel can we nail that is a lead funnel. Okay, so our target is leaning into there sales side of things. So really just consistency and getting once you get the consistency around it like right now their biggest issue is show rates because of these multifunnels like the messaging isn't in alignment. So they're getting we had this we had the lowest show rate we've ever had uh not ever but the lowest show rate we've had in like a year and a half uh last month and there's like seasonality to it and this and that. like I'm not going to allow any of that to be the blame because it's clearly what we're doing here in messaging, what we're doing in optimization, what we're doing uh in framing before versus after that needs cleanup and then what the messaging is that occurs post uh in emails, in texts, uh in conversation with the setter, if they even get to a setter, for a setter to confirm with them. Um so yeah, so that's kind of where we're focused on the marketing point. On the sales point, it's what can we do around this messaging? uh a lot of the we we had some management changes and things that occurred that instantly boost things up, but then we had culture issues and kind of culture fit jive pieces. So I'll make other videos on that probably in the future, but we adjusted how we were uh operating and managing in that department. Um and I'll get into that part here. So for we have a new chief of sales that came in that is an absolute rockstar full ramps in a couple weeks that we are focused on. Uh we have a sales ops manager that's been like with us for a minute now and just crushes has taken on way more responsibility and then actually is leveraging who we're using internal for our tech support. So um this person is a rockstar and really wasn't getting leveraged within the uh tech team can do any SOP can do any automation can do anything like that and uh or manual automation. So like anything you don't want to directly automate. So now she is being leveraged inside the sales role to do essentially like VA uh SOP work inside the CRM inside audits inside all that which frees this person to do much more high leverage you know peopleto people side of things. So this person looks over both setters and closers chief of sales over outbound director which is essentially setter manager and has a grouping of setters and then we have all of our closers. Okay. So, we made the move um from 30 to 45 minute call slots because we had so many missed opportunities within the sales bucket. Essentially, missing 10 to 20 calls a day where one call was going over because it was longer than 30 minutes. They're working out financing, they're working through objections, whatever, which again, objections and all that piece and the framing does come back to marketing and how the messaging is either here or here. Um, so we are focused on fixing that on the marketing side so that it flows over to the sales side, but we moved the call booking range. And it's hilarious because we have the same count of bookings on day because so many of the sales reps were setting blocks on their calendar so that the calls could go from 30 to an hour. And then the ones that weren't were having a lot of missed opportunities where they had to basically say, "Oh, I'm on another call. Can you give me 10 minutes or 15 minutes or try and pass the call off?" A lot of broken things there. So once we get those stats in, we actually had our highest close rate we've had in a very long time. like year to date it's the highest close rate but because the show rate wasn't there the the blended sales per booking which is a function of uh show rate and close rate was lower this month which is not ideal um and then again we also had some management and culture kind of shifts and changes that occurred in this department um but yeah so marketing setters sales they are like all moving in the right direction with a couple tweaks I bet we can unlock 4.5 to five just like that um just from some changes there and then in doing so we likely are going to be spending the same amount so CPA will drop and marginal drop on that. At this range, we are up, you know, over overhead numbers. If you watch past videos where I'm talking, we're at like 1.5 1.6 million. We have a large team as you can see here. Um, and a lot of fulfillment because we are coaching heavy. Uh, very little info. So, we have an entire team of coaches that onetoone fulfill on our offer. So, we are very team heavy and very management of people heavy because you have so many team. Uh, and then all US-based, W2, all the things. So we are found found foundationally set to be doing 5 8 10 uh a month with just some small scales and tweaks and I bet we are going to unlock that here uh over the next 30 to 90 is our target. Um next into fulfillment onto this piece. Um and I can kind of go into these funnels deeper on other videos if you guys want or like as we change them but all to say these are all running and they all actually have like pretty good stats but now we're getting all the data around. So kind of jumping over actually to tech first. The tech department now has a marketing and is soon to be full sales tech. Uh right now it's all marketing tech and the data that unlocks and what we're doing with custom data lakeink uh and uh source of truth and everything that we're moving from HubSpot or having as HubSpot in connection with the data lake is massive like the data that we have the uh cost per live call per funnel based on last attribution across these ranges across this and this uh the completion rate throughout like the throughput versus one versus the other so we can know which one to spend into what campaign and take 2k budget from here and put it into this one that outputs this like all of that is starting to show and come through in good reporting. Uh and that has been a major unlock for us to be able to make these decisions because we didn't have the proper data which is essentially on me because I used to sit as marketing tech even though I was like sitting up here uh and running that. So this department is like crushing right now now that uh he has uh bandwidth free um from the marketing. I mean I always did the marketing tech but the sales tech piece. Um so now this is being more system tech and kind of uh fulfillment tech while still doing some of the sales tech and passing the torch because this happened within the last 30 days. But in that fulfillment side of things. So fulfillment is another big unlock for the actual like cash collected and the LTB to CAC ratio. So over here you're going to have chief of people and product which is kind of like a dual split world where where is it? So this is essentially you have retention team which is fully focused on what happens after that first year of the pro of the program finding them in activation points and resigning them for either another year. We rolled out a lower uh a lower price continuity. So, it's basically like a downell continuity offer on the back end, which will be a major lift um to the retention percentage and it's also has a much higher um uh gross like a margin percentage. Um, it's technically lower dollars, but it is able, because it's a group coaching model, the fulfillment allows you to have 10 times the amount of client load. Not 10 times, but like six times the amount of client load over here where you have one coach to many groups, uh, instead of one coach to one person and across, you know, call it 50, 100, 150 clients, whatever number. Um, I've seen people run the business model different ways. You have a CS team. You have an HR because we haveund and whatever W2 team. You have a talent experience manager that's all about onboarding and then like internal culture leading all the departments in that way or leading all the culture within the departments in that way. And then you have your coaching staff which is a massive team of onetoone coaches. So all of this sits over here and that is a massive fulfillment lever because or I'm sorry a massive monetization lever because we can offer and in increase LTV on this layer right here because these are the onboarding. So what other things can we introduce? What other offerings can we have? So we're building out a new front-end offer. We're building out uh continue um like uh in addition LTV boost that will then happen on onboarding. So there are other things that we're going to offer. I can go into that later. Um, but all of those have kind of been like in progress and sitting there and it's hard for one person to kind of work on all of these all at once. Um, so we are navigating that piece. But fulfillment has been crushing in terms of like actual client results in terms of changing the framing to be like we're servicing your one-year contract to get you the most result possible to that plus, oh, this is a lifelong approach. Oh, this is a multi-year approach. And then these guys are coming in and absolutely crushing it. So our target this month is like four and some change. And I think we can hit it uh with some of that. And then kind of leaning a little bit deeper into this tech piece. Uh we had major wins here. We had major major wins in terms of what we're doing with data and tech and the data side of it that already existed for marketing just got like gasoline poured on it. So now we have eyes on everything over here. Um the tech standpoint of what we're kind of slowing them down on this. We have different platforms we're moving to um for setters and closers for um dialing. Right now we're on Elawware and HubSpot. We have dialers that we're looking at. We have uh send blue or messaging blue uh platforms looking at for closers. So all the levers we can pull to like make their jobs more efficient, we now have the bandwidth to be able to do that in a tech uh system setup. Um because you know we kind of were like backlogged. Fulfillment side uh like I said is already kind of there. And then this finance finance and op side is huge. So structurally right now I'm essentially how we're structuring this is all of these kind of just like full run their own departments and then what'll happen is I'll have a cadence with all of them. We have a cross sync meeting where we'll do like an operationalwide meeting. And really what I'm trying to foster is they all kind of report to the collective of themselves in here. So this team comes in makes decisions all together. I sit in there and then Luke up here and oops whatever names who cares. Um Luke up here. Um we don't we hate titles. So integrator, COO, CEO, visionary, whatever. It doesn't matter. like we sit in on this meeting, we're making group decisions and then the idea being that they come and and implement those within their departments and we put them in the project boards. The project boards get broken down into, they get assigned, they get due dates, they get timelines, all that. And it's kind of becoming a bottleneck where we'll make all these good decisions and like people ask me like oh like where where you know I always ask I'm like oh what's your bottleneck? Where are you stuck? I can very clearly identify what is happening and but to get it to be executed like through departments and then have the department lead uh or seuite be able to execute on them within their department both at the people level and the project level has become like a big kind of spot we're almost like stuck at um and where we're not getting the team efficiencies out of the clearly massive headcount we have. So the next role in this in this finance and ops world is I'm getting tons of data reporting now that I have that either I've built or the team has built for how we can optimize and get team efficiency and see basically like return on team return on person global as well as at the department level all the costs that are associated by users and licenses and seats um all that and then the new piece that I'm about to roll out is I'm going to get a project manager that right before this meeting I just uh hired that is going to essentially sit right here under me. So, no name. We're not using names in here. No doxing. So, we're going to have a project manager that essentially sits under me that I don't even know where you want to put this, but let's just throw it like right here because that's kind of more so where it is. And we'll sit under me and we'll sit in on all these meetings and notetaking is probably the wrong word, but like basically come in. We're going to have all the conversations, make these decisions instead of playing phone tag where I go here, we have this conversation, uh we all have this conversation about what needs happen in marketing. Then this is person is responsible for putting this into project boards, get setting timelines, uh assigning everyone out, knowing what needs to happen before the next person happens before the next and then have to like follow up the people for deadlines and get all that done. Like we have so many key like you know Seal Team Six vibe people, but like it's almost like they're just like everyone's excited in a room but can't figure out the structure and order and what in which it needs to happen. So, this person, no silver bullets, no silver bullets, uh, but is going to come in and be able to support in helping like lead through the structure of all these projects, and then I'll have a cadence with this person going through essentially like whip reports and whip um, setups on where we're at with different projects. I will continue to have the cadence with all of these individual uh, leaders and what projects are going on in their department with this person sitting side by side me. So, I'm very excited for this because I think this is kind of like the unlock of efficiency. and I literally said like no more hires after this until we hit, you know, five million plus a month just because I want the revenue per employee back to XYZ dollars. Um, and that's kind of where we're at. So, yeah, I'm uh I'm stoked on this. I have some new numbers on here. I mean, everything is at some level up and to the right. Um, but it's like still squishy fluffy up and to the right. And this number needs to be four or 5 million for this math to start kind of shoring out to where I want it to in terms of like profit uh in terms of cash flow in ter in terms of reserves that I'm sitting at based on the first essentially four to five months of the year that were terrible. So we're kind of building ourselves out of a hole here and I'm not going to just like pretend like we're Oh my god, it's going to drive me crazy. Was that like that the whole time? Um so yeah, I mean that's that's my focus right now is doing those and leaning into those. So, not sure if this was as helpful as can be, but yeah, this is a setup. This is where we're optimizing for. Um, I'm real excited for kind of who who's new on the team in some of these core positions. Uh, we have like very good synchronicity now across this and we're going to see how that runs. This is going to be a major unlock for me. I didn't do a ton of, you know, I feel like I kind of shared what went right and what went wrong in these, but all of them have more efficiencies. All of them have more output for what is in the team. We have such strong people. We have such strong culture. We have all of that like right there teed up and it's just like we're just missing that quick unlock. You look at marketing and it's like okay cool. It says cost per live call and we just need to figure out which one of these buckets to lean into and optimize around and it's right there. You look at the same thing on the buyer side of it on the buyer funnel. It's like right there. Sales it's like okay cool. It's consistency around these metrics and once they're there it's more reps and then the volume is right there to follow because marketing can fill. It's fulfillment knowing that right now we're a leaky bucket. We're going to change out our client fulfillment software literally coming into this next month. um which is going to be able to get more efficiencies in how many clients per coach we can have. So that'll get cost down as in relative because the baseline will go up. We're going to do the same thing um with what our leaky bucket in terms of what we can continue to sell them both in ascension and retention. So retention piece after the year and ascension piece in what other offerings we have or additional pieces tech so much leverage in what we're going to get from the data systems and structure that we're changing where everything is going to be centralized in one source of truth which is amazing for enterprise value and future everything right because we'll have everything in one place none of this scattered six sheets and whatever and then the finance and ops feeds off of that but then also just structurally how we're doing things with a project management lead that sits there next to me. So hopefully this was helpful. Um, I kind of just yapped there for a second, but I got to fly out of here and I did this one way too late today. So, I appreciate you guys. I don't know what day it is. 110 or 112 orund I don't know something. But you guys rock. Links down here. I'm doing a survey info-coaching. Uh, this is just survey where I'm just trying to figure out what people are doing in the space. Offers, pricing, uh, cash collected numbers. It has, uh, contact info on the end if you want to. You don't have to. Um, and then doc, this is going to show all the videos, uh, and all of the ones we've made every single day for 110 or something days. Broken down by marketing, sales, ops, tech, all that. And then Rolodex. People constantly ask me on what needs to happen or who they need or who I have recommendation for in terms of sales, marketing, tech, who I use for personal coach, what softwares I use. These are ones I've trust. These are ones I vet. I refuse to send the names of these people because I'm not just going to get them blown up in their DMs. So, if you feel like you qualify, have some minimum thresholds that it can make sense, but you need to send me context cuz like the sales vendor for example, like I'm completely under the assumption that people should not or the belief, I'm sorry, that people should not have internal sales teams if they're running an info coaching cash flow business. I think it is something you should just outsource and worry about the other pieces like marketing and how hard you can scale it uh at the right costs and then fulfillment and LLTV and then just let the sales happen uh outside uh for a fixed fee. So, I have this, but like this guy does only works with people, for example, that are over 100K a month, maybe a little bit less, but very rarely. Then have the right structure and offer and all that kind of stuff. So, like I'm not just going to give you the name. So, you just DM me on IG, let me know, give me some context, where your offer is at, what scale you've done, how long you've been around, all that kind of stuff. And if it makes sense, I'll make an intro. Same thing with marketing. I have media buyers, I have agencies that we've worked with that I that we are now in-house, we don't work with, um, guys who build offers for beginners, beginner guys. This guy's a G. um as well as for massive big business like he deals with people do multiples a month multiple million a month um but also doesn't really matter you I'm you know you can find people on X or you can ask or you can do whatever but people were asking so that's that I appreciate you guys hopefully this was helpful for you it was helpful for me to write it out and think it out and hit me on Instagram or X bye This

# We Roasted These Funnels… Brutal but Effective (w/ Josh Gavin) | EP110
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sFJAB10SBE

What's up, guys? We are back. Day 110 in a row and we've got Josh Low Ticket Gavin according to his name on here. Josh Low Ticket Gavin. Legal name. Legal name. That's true. Uh, so we are going to do funnel reviews today. We posted on X uh to get some feedback or to get some form submissions. So Josh is essentially going to MC lead it and go through Sharon screen and then we're just going to bounce back and forth and go through them. So Josh, kick it off. Or actually, who are you people for the new news? Oh, I'm a I'm a 23-y old kid living in Minnesota. I build low ticket offers. I built um we're approaching 550 low ticket offers I've architected or worked on myself. And yeah, I just love low ticket. I don't I believe in high ticket. Low ticket is a means to attract high ticket, so don't confuse me with those people who say you can be profitful just low ticket. Um and yeah, we're going to jump into this and give some people some advice. Lots of low ticket in here. So, it's my favorite. It's my favorite. Let's do this. Who ready? So, first one on the table, we have it looks like an agency bisop and I asked them for as much data as possible and not everyone gave a ton of data. So, if you ever submit your funnel in a future episode, make sure to give us as much as possible. But what I know so far, Ryan, is they said, I believe, so I believe the front-end sales uh are $25 to $30. CPA, I'm going to in a second. Okay. In a second. So, we got CPA around 30 to 25 to $30. Order bumps are at a 5% take rate. That's super low. I think he means his upsells, too. So, I think the biggest thing we need to help him right with is going to be his upsells. So, let me pull these up here. I'll share my screen. So, we got an upsell issue. Usually, the problem I see upsell is they're just it doesn't make usually aren't making it clear on why this makes sense on top of what they already purchased. But Ryan, can you see my screen? All right. Yeah. This is a $25 CPA for a $3 front end, right? Yeah, it looks like. Yeah. Let's see how much the ebook is. Go to step two. That page is hurting my soul a little bit. Dude, this is bad. Uh, but hey, it's again. And when we say anything, I was going to say when we say anything on this, it's not Oh, that's interesting. Pre-check and nine after it was a three. Um, before Yeah, before we say anything, this is this is all constructive. Like obviously people are trying to get feedback. We're not like [ __ ] on anybody at all. Like anybody who's trying and doing this is, you know, 9,000 steps in the right direction. So um but all right. So what data do you have? A $25 CPA. Yep. And you have AOV. Uh no, he did not use AOV. And uh Otto's could use Titaning. And that's all he said. So got it. We're just going to rip it. But he said we know there's a 5% take credit on order bumps. And so I'm assuming he means these and he might be meaning his upsells too. So either way we know that the upsells and order bumps are not hitting. Um first thing I'll say here I only talk we'll talk about the sales page in a second but just on here like Ryan look at this seven figure soup to nuts recipe. What do you think that is without reading this? Like the seven figure soup. I have no idea. I I have no idea this for agency. The agency box book is what people are doing. And they have a seven figureure soup to nuts. So it's basically how to take your agency to seven figures if I think about it for two minutes straight. But like off the rip, it's not copy is not on. That builds an agency that runs without you is different. You can that could be a whole different like something that builds or runs on its own is a machine which is much different than a seven figure type of offering. So, if you're trying to get to seven figures, that's like a scaling how to go from, you know, if these guys are what who's the who's the ICP? Is it someone who already has an agency? Uh, it looks like somebody for agency owners and freelancers. Yeah. So, existing phoneless meetingless agency that creates halftime lifetime. Less laptop, more beach approach. God, it sounds like my worst nightmare, but some people love that [ __ ] Um, you ever had a laptop on a beach, by the way? Dude, it's the worst. I can't do I can't I can't see my screen. Mac has that new like uh whatever non- glossy laptop screen and I refuse to get it on anything because I'm like no no no sunlight. I'm either in the cave. It's hot. It's annoying. I don't I want to I want to be relaxed about it. Be totally working. People are going to watch this and be like, "What the they talking about?" All right. All right. So, from from the get sales page needs some love. Your spacing's all over the place. This This looks like GHL build, which is I cannot stand Ghell's uh default font. It just irks me. But we see here, we don't know what it like this kind of sells the outcome. Like this the phone list. Like I love like the outcome you're selling could be really good. I know this will hit. It's obviously selling. Agencies hate doing fulfillment. They hate uh they hate selling meetings. Yeah. They hate phone calls. They hate having a calendar full of meetings to do demos and do they hate the whole business model. They want to get out of it. Everyone would hate the agency. I bought everything. Yeah, dude. I think so. If you look at Jeff, we did this offer for Jeff Miller called agency behind the scenes. Uh oh, find the old page. Yeah. So, we did his we did this offer. Let's see if it worked. Let's see. Um sometimes my Wi-Fi just like blocks certain funnel sites. So, we'll see. Okay. So, let's look at a better example of a an offer that did over I think we got him to 100,000 a month on MR for his school group. Okay, so I built this funnel super ugly, really basic, but it's still ripping. So, we look at what's a good example. Uh, this is like pretty much summing up everything you're trying to say, just a better headline. So, we're implying that fulfillment is simple, right? Fulfill in 30 minutes. We're saying it's high profit and then we are saying that it's volume. So your thing is trying to say a lot of different things just not clear. And so uh we also I think you seems pretty close like happy clients seems like you kind of modeled this already. Well having happy AF clients that's something Jeff just says and so I pulled that that pay you longer than the month because you actually get them results. I like that. So this one ripped and uh again and then here we're going to what is it actually like your page I don't know like obviously the VSL can probably say stuff also like the overlay you picked seems very interesting like I don't know how it really connects or pulls me in. Yeah, YouTube video is not a vibe either. Oh gosh, a bass boost in my ears. So he said more beach less laptops. Um you should sell drop servicing at that point if that's true. But anyways, you need to fix that. You need more clarity. What is this? Who is this for? We talked about this in the last episode, but at the top of the page, right away, who is it for? What outcome is going to get them? What's the narrative of it? You're not hitting it there. Um, and then I love how many testimonials are. It does add a lot of social proof, and this is why you're probably converting like very high solution, state, warm people. But if you were trying to scale this, you're de like I know this funnel is going to hit a ceiling because it's not converting to people who aren't automatic buyers. Like, you're converting to people that Yeah, that whole thing like if you scroll up a little bit more. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Um, no, do it. No, like just like everyone's on mobile those. No one can even read those and like you're choosing and then you're doing different like like I'm such a sucker for like consistency around stuff like this and like you're the wording you're choosing to use as like the highlight you're doing in like this lower case on some you're doing like this uppercase. And like I get if you're trying to copy direct, but like people can't even read those. The margin that's both on left and right side as well as between is like crazy. Like no one's reading those. Someone's scrolling through that page as fast as possible until they get to the break where this and then they're trying to and then they're reading this because this is like more correct. You're using red on there. Another stupid example, but like you know these are the things on what's inside. Red is a no no generally if it's not in your brand stuff. And like that then is like all designed differently. I think just with a cleaner design, you're going to double. Yeah. Yeah. Like literally just I mean you're trying I see you're trying to pull a mixture of Allen's automatic clients page plus your own. I would just stick to the structure. Um this one I call it the mini AC funnel. The first one I I I was lazy. It was funny. Allan was talking about this on his call. He's like, "Yeah, people start doing mini AC cuz they're lazy to build long one." I'm like, "Yeah, it's 100% why I did it and it rips." And so I did the mini AC for for Jeff and it'll work in your market, too. doesn't work in some, but you might as well just like model the structure. If you're already trying to do it, like if you're going to try to follow a template, you might as well follow this. And this is like this is an ugly version of our pages and it's did fine. So, you can design this very simple and this one ripped, you know, 100,000 months and it's just very clear and nothing fancy. So, it's shorter than your page. You'll be able to build it. you just, you know, hire a designer to make you a a legit old way, new way thing or just get a Canva template that's in the free nothing held back group and you should should be good there. Um, your buttons are different colors like what you know it's blue now it was green before. Yeah, exactly. I think consistencies I hate I hate this little thing. I know people crush with it though so like all the power to you but like consistency I'm just talking design honestly right now but it's like consistency and that and then you're you're really good at this. So, like how would you how do you have your checkboxes? Like they have like what Blake was talking about where they have the mult multi- option which I which does is shown to like to work. I think that one's a little confusing because it's like all the same. Like for us, for example, we have one we have a two check on ours and it's like discount applied. It's like the two product discount applied. It's just two options. It's like you're either going to get the one main thing or you're going to get the other one with the discount applied. That is the order bump um separate because right now you essentially have You have what? Eight eight different AOVs you could have or I mean that's multiplication on there. So it's actually four because they could have this one and this one and this one. But like that's just kind of crazy behavior. And then same thing with what Josh said is like seven figure soup to nuts. Like no like one of these is like how to scale this how to scale it to seven figures which again is the next kind of step I believe in the current state you're just trying to make it so they can run the business model that's like light. And then the next thing right here is you're already introducing how to scale that business model from likely a couple clients to, you know, over 100k a month or 83k a month or whatever. The next one. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. It's freaking client quick makes sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. So, it's like, see, and this is for order bumps. Everyone watching this, the reason I'm able to get like a 40 to 50% take rate on all my bumps is because we sell tools or milestones. Like templates and tools are your best friend. Um, and if your front end's education, it's like a course, a workshop, a book, your the up rest of the upsells, like especially if it's bisop or B2B, give them tools to speed up the outcome on the front end. So things like this, obviously I wouldn't just say client wins. There's more you need to add into this, but uh it definitely is way better out of all of these. Like if I had to pick this one, swipe files do well. This one would, you know, probably are too high take rate if I had to guess. And then this one I would just delete alto together. Um, Ryan, answer your question about what I would do here. I've actually never have done uh like check things like this. I usually make it like if I'm doing an audio book, I just have a separate bump for that there and I always just have it be one product because I just don't want them to like I feel like they just overthink here and I know it works well. And if anything, I would just do the book and then the book plus audiobook option just so I don't have to make a whole another bump for it. But ideally on the order form, my goal is like the least amount of friction. And I want them to quick quick buy. Like don't second guess. Don't overthink. And this is just too much like thinking going on before they they get down here. So I would definitely fix that. You're nuking your conversion rate. And the whole point of order bumps is that it doesn't hurt your uh I'm sorry, your convert did I say that your conversion rate um yep is just getting nuked because people have to scroll through all that because they're trying to check it. They're trying to understand what the difference is. It's like not clean at all. H Okay. Um what do we got here? It's here's the thing like offers like this bro like they sometimes make a lot of money like they can rip like ugly funnels they can rip. So especially in these markets ugly funnels too is one thing but but the thing is like it depends on the market. The reason like this is getting by and getting sales because it's like one to 100 it's biz up. It's like you're not going to get away. So people watching this like if you have if you're not in those markets you're going to need something a little nicer. So, don't think I'm giving you the green light to to do this. But for him, he has an excuse. Like, he can get away with this. Um, okay. I take this out. Take these out. Mobile. These just suck. If you don't have a guy who can design something where it shows like one little thing here, one little thing here, one little thing here that don't just use the default elements to do this. It's just because mobile it looks super bad. But on desktop, it looks really nice. like it it goes across the top of the page like this. So try to hire someone in Canva that can make a smaller version of this or like screenshot it, make it small and then put it here or just like don't have it. Um welcome. You didn't affirm the purchase at all. Uh you didn't like say, "Hey, you just got everything you need. Here's like you didn't explain why they need this next." So you said, "Great. Gotcha." And you bait and switched them and said, "Special offer. here's everything you need. So, you're like, "Wait, I didn't get everything I needed on the front end, you scammer." Right? That's like these people think. They're like, "You freaking like you you just stole my money." And then that's why you get refunds and why you get people in the ads being like, "What are the upsells?" Or, "What are you trying to sell me later?" You got to you got to you got to affirm it. So, go back and watch our other episode. We talked about this before. Uh how I used anytime. Keep scrolling on there. opening with anyone any time. What does that even mean? Start layback sales conversations. So, you should have framed time. You should have frame this as a just client getting scripts. Honestly, like that's a if you're doing agency, everyone watching this, I've done so many agency offers uh like SEO agency, AI agency. Like I did a couple really good agency offers and all a sudden all the agency dudes want me to make like compete against my other funnels. So, it's very simple. You teach them a new agency model in the front end. Upsell one then is templates to get clients. Upsell two is fulfillment related templates. And that's it. And then order bumps are swipe files, examples, and case studies. Do that funnel, you'll rip it every time. A winning offer I did when I was a kid that I wish I would have kept going was called five meetings a week challenge. Very clear where the goal is get five meetings a week, close at 20% and get one client, one client a week. I'm going to show you how to do it. They come into the course, very clear outcome and the same upsell templates and then fulfillment. So, still waiting for someone to do that offer. I keep throwing it out there and no one wants to do it. Another one is inbound agency clients. That's another one that was really good. I've got a whole bunch. So, dude, just like make this upsell focused on just getting clients and make that very clear. And then also, I thought we already got this in the order bump. So, we're back to the soup. Back to the soup. Uh, yeah. So, I would just redo again. Follow a structure like literally go through at the top. Does it group those? Um, it's breaking down all the courses. No, it doesn't. Saying to you, you get more and then it's like you there's course one, there's course two, there's course three, there's course four, there's course five. And if they make it to the end on that page, it's like add a butthole. And also again, yes, ugly things can work. Like we talk about this on here all the time, but like you could have the ugliest page of all time and have your address at the bottom and nothing else functions on p on the page and people will mail you to buy stuff if it's like a good enough offer. But I don't think the offer makes sense even. I don't think it's even like like structured in a way. So it's a 101 in courses, 804 in savings. That doesn't make Yeah. It's like it's design and copy on this like in a nice So and we don't have the data because I don't know your AOV. You said it's like we just know his order bumps are 5%. Which like even if he means to check that's really low. That should be like 50. So step two customize. Step three customize. That isn't like even more beach laptop and even more beach. More beach and more less less laptop. Even more dude you get a beach. You get a beach. Double the beaches. Upsell one is how first how to get the beach lifestyle. Upsell two is how to get two two beaches for one. It's like supplements. You sell more beaches. I'm not even going to read like I don't even know, dude. What is the headline on this? How to turn that and then scroll the bottom. The world wait there. We go wait. The world famous five minute Loom videos that sell. So this is acquisition. So this is this is teaching them without Yes. Because the first thing they need to understand is how to get more clients. And I don't know if you're framing with your mechanism of e or I mean a mechanism or like USP is even more beach and less laptop the mechanism on this being loom videos that if anything you kind of want that to be more USP as well because it's just a loom video and everyone's like oh a five minute Loom video. Yeah. You're selling the template. you're selling. Here's the easy cookie cutter way to have like no whatever, no time like any of the stuff acquisition, which is the looms. Yeah. Yeah. I want to try to pull this up. But yeah, so that I would change that. Let me try to find an example here quick. So like I know people are like, "Well, give me an example. What does it look like? Josh and Ryan, you're out here like telling me it's all bad. Give me example." Let me try to find an example my swipe file here and then we'll jump into the next one because we got some more I want to get through. Um I have a hard stop but I already told you that but just FYI. So we got to get hard stops nowadays. I'm trying to protect my time. Got to get that assistant bro. I know I do. Got to get that assistant. Okay. Here's my swipe. I'm going to show you some mock page. Um I luckily fun hack. Duplicate your funnel. So, like if you share with people, they don't actually have your legit link. So, um hopefully a lot of you guys do that here, but just like an outline of a page. I would just switch it to a page like this where it says, and can you see my screen, Ryan? Is that good? Yep. I got you now. Yep. Important. So, it's up here. Do not close. 100% secure. So, it's all secure. Don't worry, it's all good. Watch this welcome message below. So, we say welcome. Please watch this video. And the spacing is whack right now because my desktop has a weird setting. I have a weird extension. That's freaking it up. Um, but watch this video. You'll learn how to get the most out of the program and then please watch this video. Your steps unlock a gated VSSL. So the CTA button appears after these 8 minutes here and then they can purchase or not. So, if anything, if you want to save yourself in design, everyone watching this, just do a gated VSSL upsell like this. And then below when it pops up, it's I I'm not going to wait 8 minutes here, but it's legit just a freaking like mockup with a button and like a guarantee badge and that's it. And it it crushes. We have a we have an upsell like this, literally the same page, selling a 997 done for you offer, and we're converting 10% on cold traffic. So, yeah. Um, just steal that page. What's the ticket on this? What's the ticket on this one? That one was just a 197 and then there's still having the consumption of that for that and then also everything that happens in emails and all that. We're not going to go into that because we just only have pages but like Yes, sir. those crank and like even that page has some love it could have right like No, seriously. Right. Like clickable uh whatever like thumbnail on there uh all that kind of stuff. Huge. And then so for you Yeah, I would do that on there. I would do some version of that and then I would also make sure that you frame the first upsell like Josh was talking about like what is the first thing that happens not a course bundle of seven different things and then the next one being more of the same framing it as like the loom you know the templates here's your templates now on how to get clients like today right is like you know so I think they probably understand I'll shut up now let's do it all right next one I think this is an uh health vertical Let's see. Okay, so X1 is here. Oh, there we go. Yep. Sales for cost. So, it's very new. It looks like they just started these ads. Okay, so all that matters for us right now is cost per results 45 bucks. And of course, we have no AOV. I think we need to change how we're adding. We're going to add in this stuff. We'll make it better. There'll be a link below for you guys have a better one. We started running ads on June 26. I plan on making the copy stronger for ads or find a sales copy and add an order bump in Otto to increase AOV. For now, we wanted to launch quickly and uh test instead of trying to perfect everything. Focus to get customers quick result from the front uh book and consultation uh to sign up for coaching. I'm already going to push back on doing a book, but I I'll say h it's whatever. All right, let's see what this is. All right, so this is the one that's $45 CPA. It's such small data. Bro, what the freak? Your page is SC. It doesn't have an S. My Wi-Fi doesn't pull up pages. It don't have a nice little I think it's a secure thing. Let me see here. SSL. Mine definitely won't. Mine won't even open some of your pages. Go here. If you want to pause, I can try to pull connect to different Wi-Fi. We can try to pull it up. Not pausing the next one. Let's see. Let's see if anyone else has a legit. Okay. Okay. Here we go. So, we got another one here. All right. So, so we got pixel set up. So, it's book a call funnel. Cost per lead is cost per lead. Book a call button click is $30 and it has no bookings. All right, let's look at it. You want this average play like 15 10% conversion link click to VSL play. All right, let's check this out. Click Funnels 2.0 page. Do you want mobile view? Yeah, 95% of most people's traffic. Yeah, I'm already I'll let you. You're a big VS. You're a Vs. I mean, you literally you're offer you're on you guys use VSSL. DTA what I always talk about is a DTA funnel. Crush these is how they run. So, um it's going to be headline VSSL. watch this thing and then schedule your call, book a call, apply, whatever. Okay, so if you scroll through that page, what happens when you learn elite mentorship career progression? So it's a closing biz up on how to become a remote closer. Yeah. And then book a call is embedded on page as well. And then what happens if you like can you click on that or go? I think it's probably going to do the same thing. Go to Why is it right clicking? there. Okay. It goes down. Oh, just it's just CJ. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Um All right. So, you click on that. What are the application questions? Let's go book a call. Okay. He's got available time today, which is good. Speed. Why is it not working? Here we go. Let me try to I might have to change it to desktop. That's fine. Oops. We're both like I mean some at some level it's fine. No one's going on. So very very limited. Wait. Okay. Calendarly has been bugging a little bit. All right. Uh how would you describe? I'm currently working high ticket sales. Monthly earnings. Where are you at now? Where do you want to be? And then this is just classic. I have little savings. I have some savings. Can you pay me? These questions are so like clear. It's like I'm going to sell you something. I want to make sure you have this much money to be here. Yeah, dude. I know. It's like whatever. It still works, I think. I don't know. I don't run up at all. I I've actually like direct. You usually ask like their age. You ask how much they have saved? That's fine. Do they have an existing business? When did they get into business? Are they working a job? You ask like indirect. And then you come up with like and you maybe ask if you show like if it does make sense would you be able to uh invest. That's usually how we dance around it in bisop instead of directly asking because there's like there's a lot of shame involved if you're like have to click this one or like this one because people compare and they know it's not like a ton. So you gota you got to feel it out. So what are your thoughts? VSL man call phone starting up on the top. Yeah. Video reveals how sales professionals are transitioning to remote sales and earning 10 to 30K. How sales professionals are transitioning to remote sales. So, you're targeting people who are in sales in their career, but you want to teach them how to go remote without needing to cold call or quit your job immediately. Okay. I mean, that's not terrible. I mean, I think it needs to be I don't know how you're targeting or what your what your ads are bringing them to. Can you look at that data really quick? Because I think he said it was like a $2. I mean, not like it's like I think he was the one that had 3% CTR. Yeah, he had a 2% CTR click, too. Total link clicks. You've only had 93 people go to page. A good number for this is five or 10%. I know we were on I was Jeremy and he was talking 20 30% click to app, which ising crazy, but like if you're not getting like five or 10, then something is definitely broken. Yes. And you're running one ad. Not saying that's a problem, but what what are your thoughts in the ad? And sales earning four to six per month. You know, there's another level that's got to get flagged to by the new financial update like calling out specific things that's definitely going to be put in a special category soon. I also don't think that if you're in sales earning four to seven is really makes sense. Why? Like what if someone's making eight or three or 50? Also, it's like that makes like a lot of people. Yeah, completely. Lots of people target. Yeah. Uh without starting over, make the transition from the remote sales model where I can earn more. Yeah. Lean into that part. Earn more, work less, and live on my own terms. So, because really what the whole thing of remote is is like it's the ease of being able to do the job. It's the people who go and drive around and have to go to physical locations and do all this stuff like spend their entire day driving just to make have a conversation and sell or do doortodoor or whatever. Like so you're kind of also being a little broad but like not saying that's a problem but like if you're in sales and then you're tightening in the targeting to 4 to 7,000 per month people sales is massive. So, like taking someone from I don't know what your experience is, but like your experience being able to sell that. You went from door to door to remote, sell door to door to remote. If you went uh medical sales to remote, do medical sales to remote. Like be able to do that. Corporate sales. Yeah. So, he's like, he's talking about commutes and corporate and whatever. So, like layer that in somewhere. You need to like I mean most people are just going to use this and thousands commission. I kept trying to read that from here. You're good. Is that better for your eyes? I'm just like I've got like three windows open and like that's where it's at. All right. It's not I mean whatever ad you are kind of doing more more call outs but then so go back to squeeze page. Yeah. Also change that name up there but that's a little thing. Yeah. And then how to get into high ticket which now you just introduced high ticket. they don't know what that is or care because you're you're talking about true like you know what I mean like high ticket sales we know but like they're in corporate and you're teaching them remote sales and now you're talking about high ticket sales. Yeah. Also all know like meansish the same thing but they don't know that the difference between someone making 5,000 a month and 20,000 per month. So now you're talking all about income differences. Okay. So he worked with Charlie. Here's the thing. One thing I have an issue with the messaging from the offer side is and this is a big issue like a lot of people who do closing like I knew guys doing a closing setting bizop they were doing a million a month with a low tia funnel uh just like on that and what happened is they maxed out the TAM and like people are so aware of the mechanism of remote sales where there wasn't much novelty to it if you go on YouTube look at remote sales there's like a hundred influencers talking about it so you need to understand you're not in the romantic stage anymore you're in the realism and accountability stage. And so you're competing on uh results now. You're competing on you have to go that's why I see some people go to done for you uh where they they flip the upsell path done for you on the front because people are like already bought education. It didn't work. And so for you, you either need to have some sort of novelty like what makes your remote sales different because the number of people who don't know about remote sales or haven't consumed content on it um is it's way smaller. it's a really small TAM and so they're going to be comparing you to Cole Gordon uh uh the sales agency all these are dudes who are pushing massive spend and so either like the biggest thing is you don't have a ton of testimonial or status like them is to just do something different so I've been telling remote and sales people this forever but I think people should be transitioning people out of like instead of being remote sales uh in general it should be remote sales for like a new industry so my buddy just got into tech sales for like government and he's doing great I'm like dude Instead of telling people to do remote sales for info where it's very saturated, just be like, "Hey, in know remote sales, you probably try info or want really good job stock high ticket offers, you can make more money doing the same amount of work in a new market, right?" So, same thing of red ocean, blue ocean. So, if you really want to spice this up from freaking messaging wise, if you want to pierce through even though you don't have as much status as Cole Gordon, then just have a new novelty and be like, "Here's how to transition." I just going to say it's exactly what I was going to say is like them saying six their brand name being six figure remote and saying remote sales like there's competition in that market. You are basically you're duping what he created as his like I don't want to say it was really necessarily unique to him but like he owns the remote remote sale remote whatever thing. So even just having something different as like what your mechanism style or what your USP is not remote high ticket model. So like literally as simple as like remote high income, remote high, you know what I mean? Like because like they don't know what high ticket is. They're not familiar with high ticket funnels. They're not familiar with these things because they're coming from corporate world. So being able to call out corporate and then like exactly what Josh just said, moving industries entirely to this new online world. Yeah. Like existing people. Yeah. Because it's like what are the I mean exactly. You're you're literally giving the benefits in here. I just don't think they're getting to the point where they can hear this. Yeah. If you're talking about pre-qualified leads, no cold anything. You're talking about complete remote, not having to drive around and do that grind. You're talking about higher commissions is kind of one thing, but like it's more so the throughput. I don't know if higher commissions is the thing that's more important or like your higher income because higher commissions doesn't necessarily have to be I mean it is true for this but exactly the do the math portion is what's really the more think you're you're talking in a way where only a person who's already been in like knows this model would understand. So people don't understand they're checked out. So the people understand us they already know this model which means they know your competition which means you probably consume those people's via cells which so then you just made it even harder. So it be one thing if you're talking people that no idea about this stuff but your language is attracting a person who does like they don't understand but what are we selling you know is this info what are the inbound inbound calls for like the reason Cole Gordon stuff worked well and Dan Lock dude even Dan Lock he was before Cole like Dan Lock freaking milked the market but thing they had a super structure they said they were talking about how info is so big and online education's the next wave it's a billion dollar market and how you can make money from it is people need sales reps. So get into it. So for you, you're lacking super structure for why what is what's high ticket? What are we selling? Like I need to believe that people want the product. Like right now the best thing I would do like or best if I a best sales remote bisop is teaching people how to sell for AI software companies like going because AI is big. It's like AI is so much money is going into it. Everyone's AI and you know AI companies are hiring sales reps to sell their corporate or enterprise packages. has higher margins. It's an easy product to sell because everyone wants it. And I would teach them how to get into that. And so then AI becomes my super structure. And then all a sudden I can like knock on info and be like ah you know it's getting a little saturated or you know only a few winners like are big offer owners who can even hire you. But in AI like every day a new AI company's opening and so you can just flip it and just make it a way better offer. So yeah, I think it's a message and then double down. Yeah, I was going to say I agree. And then doubling down on that for the step two of this real quick and then we can move to the next one. But the schedule your call like schedule your call. Like you're telling them the literal thing to do which is like not Did that just reload at the top of the page? Yeah. Yeah. Step two, schedule your call. It needs to be like and then you're framing out the next thing is what you're going to learn on your free growth call. Like it needs to be like on an example that we use is like book your XYZ call to learn how to do XYZ and like you're aggressive here just throwing your notes up. Um everyone look at my notes. But no like framing the call is like what it actually is. So like you're calling it a free growth call, but then up there you're just saying like schedule your call, book call, choose a time to speak to me onetoone. Is it valuable that they want to speak to you onetoone or is it valuable that they want to get the result? What is the mechanism you're calling the result? Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, all right. We'll go to the next one. I was going to show you an example, but we kind of made the point here. I think it's a messaging issue for sure. You're going to run into a big market. You can make that market works. It works. I think it's like your goals. Like I if I'm going into that market, I'm expecting to build like a maximum $100,000 a month business with what's still available. But I'd be have to talk to people who don't know it exists. I'd have to create new customers instead of going after people who know about Cole and everyone else. That's just Yeah. Once you really unless you have more status because think like you have a few pages and then you compare it to Cole's page. Like dude, whole and his experience on there was how he did it, right? How he went from whatever he said he was stuck at four to 6K and then he took it to 23 or 36 or whatever number he said. Like yeah, that's not, you know, it's cool. People want to like work side by side someone who's done it more so sometimes than like big companies with all these huge stats, but like you're going up against those guys. So you need to like you need to own your corner until you have that and like resonate in that way for it to make sense for someone to want to work with you and someone who has 1,000 times the results. Yep. Okay. Next one. We have two options, Ryan. We have someone who just started ads and they spent $5. Or we can review someone who has actually told us their AOV and their CPA and other things too. Should we wait to review the person with F$5? You guys have resubmit probably. I don't know how much. Yeah, do your AOV and CPA. Okay, so this next one here, um, we're down to Yeah, we'll do at the end if you have time. Appreciate you submitting it. Whoever that was, we will. If anything, just resubmit for another episode. Um, do you move your wedding ring to your thumb when you work? It's It's a fidget. Like I fidget with it. My wife hates it. She's always like, "Stop." Like, "Don't move it." And I'm like, "You're gonna lose it. You're gonna lose it. You're gonna lose it." I'm like, "I I need a fidget ring, dude. I need like a spin or something. I need a secondary." Yeah. You need your wedding band and your engagement. What do they do? I don't I don't know. Yeah. Get the rubber one or whatever. All right. Okay. Offers toolkit is converting cold traffic at 4.6. Oo, it's pretty gassed. No, that's pretty good. That's pretty good for average cart 72, CPA 115. And what are they stuck with? More customers. We increase ad spend, but sales don't. Okay, so it breaks when they scale. Let's see how many ads are running. 20 new a week. Straight up, dude. There's so much AI right now. It's like not hard to have 20 leads. Austin Ford, I've heard that name. Yeah, he's uh he was at the event we were at. You probably met him. They good at challenges. Shout Austin atomic offers the secret. Wait, wait. Most experts thinks more content, but that's exactly what high ticket offers are failing. Less is actually more. I think I don't know. I don't believe simplify your offer. Streamline your delivery. Wait, so what's he selling in that first one? Most experts think more content equals more value. But that's not exa that's not that's exactly why those aren't working less is actually I don't think that argument hits like I don't think people think that's what makes like too many videos random bonuses and years of value sounds great but you're drifting out I would here's how I would reframe it like you're what you're trying to say is people think that they need to add more to their like they think it's a offer stack issue uh and they need to add more but I think more people think it's a funnel issue like in the market people already like there was they auto and offer issues. So that's why Alex from came in and like introduced, "Hey, here's how to fix your offer." But a lot of people in the high ticket space thinking it's a funnel issue. And so I don't know. I think for you like I would knock like it's not a funnel issue and then introduce like um like cuz people believe it is. So you have to tell them why that's not true and kind of have a counterargument. It's like stop obsessing over your funnel. The real issue is like what you're selling in that funnel because you're talking about offers. So you either talk about traffic, funnels, or offers. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's what I was going to say cuz like in that top one or that middle one, too many videos, random bonuses, and years of value. So I assume when you're talking about years of value in the first one, you're talking about more content, more value. You're talking about the traffic sources. And then you're also talking about the kind of like funnels, but yeah, exactly. Offers more than anything. Like I think I would bite on the fact that oh, you don't need, you know, to have six offers. You just need one offer and your offer is wrong. Like the reason that you're scaling is because your offer is broken. your and like lean into that and just run the gambit of like the reason it's not working uh is because of that. Even this I mean the meta of this is that's why this isn't like at that scale right is like the offer is or like it's not clear it's not clear enough. Um yeah, I like it dude. I mean like look at the I like the little testimonial snippets in there. Like our our client Jordan who turned a $500 workshop that he had as an offer into a $10,000 program. Like that's the type of sh like I like that. How do you reframe and re restructure your offer? Like I wouldn't talk about how like I would talk about the biggest like reason why people aren't converting on the phone is because you're you're telling them too much stuff. Like have you ever gone in like what if you went to a car dealership and they started telling about every single little feature you didn't care about? It's like you're probably there for one or three reasons like you want better gas mileage or he wants it looks good or he wants something safer reliable. Like a good sales rep knows when to shut up but you you can't shut up. your offer stack is so long like this this and this and then also then you have to fulfill for years and you're give like you're doing you're doing more work than you have to make your life easier they don't know what to buy they don't know what they what they're buying it's like every single person we've looked at their funnel stack so far is like has been that issue like this is the solve to that is like people don't your offer I'm excited to see what the upsell track is on this can you go to page I love that you please have an going back oh that up his stats. No, no, no. I said I love that you did that. Oh, here we go. So, this is what a pretty page looks like everyone from prior. Um, yeah, he's got Clickfunnels. He's got Clickfunnels mixed with the AC. He's got the fonts. Yeah, this is beautiful. So beautiful. First and last name. Kind of weird. The check the box over there on the right is kind of funky, but I'm sorry. This is design thing. Looks Is it? Yeah, I just I don't know if it's looks like Go Hollow font, but I think it's Click Falls. I can't tell. I don't know. Oh, look at that. It's like this is I think it's like I think I bet it's go high level. This I can sense it. I can feel it. Okay. Sorry, I'm scrolling through the beauty though. What the Yeah. Proven framework helping create five take and practically sell themselves without adding more complexity. Yeah. So, lean into I mean this is not as to be very blunt here. This is not as much my game. That's why I kind of like doing these because I like seeing them like I you know we run more in the callunnel game. Um but page is beautiful. the headline. I still am like depending on who's here because it's like yeah it's like are you taking somebody on how to create an offer? Are you telling some are you helping someone reframe their current stack or take something that currently exists as an offer and make it so it's that this is kind of like overarching all of those a little bit which maybe is the point but I would like I think when it says without adding more complexity drowning in content like one of my biggest issues with bullets. Yeah. So for everyone listening want to improve your conversions like easy way to boost it is get super clear on what you mean when people say like like the sales guy he said without starting over what does that mean starting over what like it's like pretty much the issue people have when they sell features and benefits and they're not selling outcomes. So you need to show them what things they're avoiding. So without adding more complexity, I would say without giving away lifetime coaching or support, without creating like add giving away eight bonuses or having to create eight bonuses for your offer, without um you know giving one-on-one support in your coaching, right? Like what do you got to be way more clear? So just adding that alone is going to help people uh spark their imagination for what it is they don't have to do. And so like without doing one-on-one Zoom calls every single week with your customers, without you know burning out delivery, what what's burning them out? It's probably calls. Like I said, the Zoom calls, it's probably support in the community, which people do give away way too much when they don't have to. And so if you look at um Funnel Gorgeous, they had a offer called a scalable coach, I think, and they did a really good job at this and explaining the pain points that burn out coaches and how their model avoids that. So I think you need to do more of that. Yeah, agreed. Agreed. Let's look at the Otto. Let's see. Did he have a link or order of them? Yeah, he ordered. He had three pages, right? Yeah. Check out Otto1. Yeah. What' you say? His AOV was $75. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's how you do that's how you do an OTO or I'm sorry, an order bump. That's how you do an order bump. Yes. Insider pass order. I don't know. The insider pass to top. Okay. It's just a swipe file. Insider pass. Yeah, I would just say it's a swipe file. And I think people in this market know what swipe file is and would literally want a swipe file. Yeah, if you maybe just say it. Yeah. So, yeah, it's pretty easy. This one again, great order bump. Swipe file is my favorite. One of my favorite things is called a a case study VSSL order bump. That's my unique mechanism name. Fire, right? And what you do is you sell a case study, so it's a swipe file of work you did for one of your private clients. And then at the end of it, you pitch them to book a call. So you hide the ascension within it. And so you're just selling a case study via cell as an order bump. And people love them and it helps with ascension inside your product. So uh anyways, little nugget for watching. Um 60. So he's probably making up I wonder his take rate is on his upsell. I don't know the upsell pages take rates, but this looks good. push your button change colors. I hate that stuff. Drives me crazy. Was it orange? Orange on the front page. Oh yeah. Simple congruence. You need the congrent. I love that stuff. And then there no check boxes on that. Like simple stuff like that. But like again if you're over 50 60 whatever what's your target? What's yours on checkout? 50 60%. Yeah. Yeah. You know 50 60. So, it's like don't don't worry about these little You can hire some sero guy later to obsess over over that stuff. Here's the big one. Is it a book a call so somebody can do it instantly over personalized for you? See, again, this is how you do it. Customize. Welcome to the toolkit. Reaffirm. Congratulations. You got your thing. Amazing. In-house seven figure one to many. Like there's a code have chat make the code that hides the stuff on your loop video. it. I know it. It's a thing. I have it somewhere, but hide that. Upload it to Wistia and pay or oralics and pay $211 or whatever the cost is. Here's why I'm giving you in-house system. Here's why I'm giving you an in-house seven figure one to many sales system. So, now you're teaching them how to sell. Uh-uh. I don't think I I mean, yeah. No, not yet. This isn't my game. I bet. And I get clearly it's working, but or a little bit, but what's the cost? 197 because now it's like we're going to have to educate them on believing in the one to many salesunnel which it already requires a lot of lift because you have to convince someone to be okay presenting. You have to convince someone to be okay um what I what I would have done. Here's what I would have done. Um let's see. So I would have literally version do go. Sorry you were breaking up but I didn't hear yours. No, go ahead. Okay. What I would have done is they now they have the offer. You're showing how to create the offer. I would simply show them how to present or pitch the offer anywhere. So instead of saying it has to be one funnel like you're doing here, you should help them with doing on sales calls, webinars, challenges in their group, pretty much just how to pitch it, how to present it depending on the funnel in a way that simplifies and like increases conversions. So instead of you selling them on a whole funnel build, I would have just done a instead and you're giving away a lot here. I know where you're trying to take people cuz he does done for you challenges on the back end. But I would just simply focus on the presentation and be like hey like you can have an amazing offer but if you don't present it if you don't describe it in a way that sparks the imagination and creates desire uh it won't work. So I'd be like creating an offer about how to create desire for the offer in your pitch. So it's like this mechanism on like desire like how to generate automatic desire instant desire uh in the pitch whether you're doing challenges because think you're including everyone now but this you excluded everyone who doesn't want to do a challenge or webinar which is a huge demographic of the market a lot of people don't like going and doing live events they're super stressful a lot of work huge lift there's so many objections you just added into this instead of making a product that includes everybody and then later you should introduce your done for you option where you just do it for them which everyone Everyone wants anyways. No one wants to run a challenge themselves. I mean, you know this Austin, like that's why they pay you. So, um, that's what I would change. Yeah. My thought is, yeah, for the next thing, what is the next thing they need? Yes. It's how do you how do you present it? How does what is the acquisition source or whatever of that or model for that? The other is you talked about content in these other places. How do you do traffic to it? You could sell into there what you're already doing, which is the sales system, but like how do you even get them to the phones? So that's kind of after the fact of these other two. And then what I think for this and where I my mentally would go is like, oh, you just got how to simplify your offer or how to make the best offer, whatever. And it's like, oh, it's right here, but how do I do that faster? And it's literally I'll pay $197 for a 30-minute implementation call or an hourong implementation call for whatever dollar value where you have a coach. It kind of messes with fulfillment a little. So I don't know what your team stack looks like. Um, but like that's what I would do. Like further implementation, same information, further implementation as an upsell. Uh, you have so many levers you can pull with this cuz it's like once you have the offer or the idea that they're then going to be able to solve for the offer. It's like you can do it faster, you can do it quicker, you can have it done for you completely for a thousand bucks. I'll get on with you and I'll do the entire offer for you with you. Yep. Um, should all be about offers then have separate funnels for challenges and everything later. But like this should all be about offers until the back end. Does he have another page on there or is this the last one? Let me click no thanks. I think his last one. Yeah. So no downell. You should have a downell. Might as well have a pop-up down even though I click no thanks. It should pop it down. Yeah, exactly. And then just be like, hey, no. Okay, fine. And you get the same thing on a payment plan, a threepay plan that equals or two pay plan that equals out to whatever 250 or 300. Yeah. Three pay plan of 97 97.97, you know. Yep. Cancel, you know, you can get a refund. You don't get the value. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a good that's a has a lot of that has a lot of legs. I love stuff like that because I I truly like and I think a lot of people in the market that you're targeting are under the belief of like offer offer offer. So, if you're someone who can solve that, dude, like that right now resonates for me because I'm like, "Oh, if we crack this low cold low ticket offer, I don't understand that. It's like if they crack that cold low ticket offer, that cold whatever offer, like nothing else matters." Like, of course, everything else matters, but like that's such the core thing. So, you're saying low ticket funnels are most important funnel to have. I'm saying uh go to what is your thing? Offer publisher low ticket offers. I was trying to I'm trying to shield for you and I don't even know your link. I don't even know your links. So, No, dude. I send so many people to you on the on both sides. So, your two things right now. Let's quick shill actually though. You have the beginner friendly, which is the people who ask a lot in the Q&A is I'm like, "Oh, go here to learn how to do the expert plus marketer business model." And then I do think that there's another leg on there for operator, but that's that's a separate conversation. And then the other is you build these out for people, low tickets, full offers for people that are already what doing 100 grand a month basically. Yeah. Yeah. Like the last three people talked to all doing a million a month. And so we do it, we have the option where it's, hey, we're either going to publish you and do a performance-based deal where we're going to work with you and grow your business. Um, and then we also have the option for a lot of people watching your content or freelancers, copyrighters, you're trying to grow your skills and you're like, you know what, I want more ownership and control. I want I don't want my client breathing down my neck saying, "No, make your order bump like this or change this." like if you want that um then we teach the path uh to build a business that way which I know your your partner Luke we interviewed on our channel he followed that similar model himself and look look at the award behind you. So there's you can definitely scale these businesses pretty far. I just put the 75 on and it's like slightly slightly tilted and it glues itself directly on the second you click it. Like I literally put a corn and it got stuck. It's a little bit jarred but it's fine. It's beautiful. It's all good. So anyways, be a completely new one where it's already stuck on. Please, thank you. All right, guys. Well, we'll do maybe do another episode. We'll make a better form. Make sure to leave your AOV. Make sure you give us all your stats. Like, we'll ask for it. Um, for the person who submitted one, we didn't get to it. Run spend more money on ads and then come to us so we can give you better feedback. But appreciate you all and thanks for watching. GG. Talk soon, guys. Bye.

# we're stuck at $3M/mo... here's how we're fixing it | EP109
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH1LObJGfCU

What's up, guys? In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the bottlenecks we are currently facing at $3 million a month in cash collected in our info coaching business. We're going to go through marketing, some of the funnels, and what we're stuck at in each one of these, the sales bottlenecks, fulfillment, and admin, tech, and overhead. And then we're going to identify which one is the biggest lever to pull right now of our current bottlenecks. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 78 million actually, I think, now in uh total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is just to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so right now we're at about 3 million a month. Uh we're trending actually a little bit less than that. We're trending like 2.95 right now for this month, but last month we did over 3 million in cash. And these are our funnel stacks. So I have a lot of videos talking about these, so I'm not going to beat this to death, but essentially you have a VSSL opt-in funnel that comes through here. It's a call booking funnel. So, they apply, book a call, talk to a setter sometimes, and then talk to a closer. Uh, you also have a direct to application. So, you have someone who just applies uh direct on page. They don't have to opt in or anything to do so. And then you have a low ticket ascension that does not optimize for AOV and upsells and stuff. Optimizes to get them on the phone with a setter to then push them to a closer. All right. And do qualifications. So, with marketing right now and oops, and on each one of these funnels, there we go. So for marketing, we just uh if if we were to identify just the bottlenecks that are in marketing right now, if I started with the VSSL brand face one. So with the VSSL, this thing has always worked for us as like the core, but we just kind of hammered it too hard. So we did 71 million through uh this one funnel right here. Um and now we're layering in different ones that have different brand faces, different messaging, and all that. Um and the biggest thing with these just getting the cost and alignment. So we're just testing these right now and and these have always been kind of the tried and true for us. Um, so I wouldn't really identify as like a full-on bottleneck, but it is definitely like the issue more so, and I'll get to it a little bit later, is kind of what's happening post, but it's all around the messaging. So, we're getting the right cost per application, right cost per call that they're not backing out. So, you could push that into sales and be like, "Oh, sales isn't closing." Um, but I can get to that. I'm going to get to that in the next one. Um, but really what it is is the overall framing in the VSSL is the beginning, the framing that's in the VSSL and in the messaging prior to the booking in alignment with what's after. Um, I just did a video with Jeremy Haynes and he talked a lot about this is how marketing like do your absolute best on the marketing standpoint so that really your closers are essentially just cashiers and like we're really really thinking about that because I think a lot of what is happening especially these new funnels that we're launching um it is really compelling but like when they go to apply they're not really uh as aligned with knowing that it's you know thousands of dollars for a program or XYZ so that then when they book and then postbooking we hit them with all this stuff that's talking about like cost objections and all the value exchange all that kind of stuff it like puts them off and then the cancel no shows are increasing um so the bigger issue there is what we're getting through VSSL brand face um as well as DTA on the show and close um is the actual live call the cost per live call not necessarily just cost per call because the show rate is getting all wonky with this even though we have like all the best practices in place which kind of just goes back to the whole like golden thread of the continuity and the congruency across it so for the DTA same thing um for GTA it's just kind of all it's more so about how the application framing is especially if it's just right there available to click or you have to go in the direction which a lot of people do but usually it's for direct to cart where they will have just no button pop until like the actual CTA. So they'll land on a page that's just headline VSSL and it'll sit there uh with no button until it hits the CTA like 20 minutes later. So think like uh like ClickBank offers or stuff like that. Um there's a ton of people who run these, but usually it's when they're buying something direct um instead of like booking or applying and then booking a call. So, I don't know. Uh, on this one, we're kind of like stuck on this one a little bit. It's working, but like really only for retargeting piece. So, it's like can't stand alone. And then this one is the biggest lever for me right now in the marketing bucket of like bottlenecks is this uh low ticket. So, for us right now, we're selling this, but it's like an original. It's an OG uh one that I made and it really just kind of again also acts more as a retargeting. This is truly like the only piece that's acting really really good for cold and we're spending, you know, tens and tens of thousands of dollars a day. Um, so a majority of it will go up here and this will pick up pieces of it. Um, but what we need is somewhere where this works for us better. So right now it's just not a cold friendly enough like positioning or offer. Um, so we can't scale it beyond, you know, XYZ 50, 100, 150, whatever number um, a day and we need to go to hundreds a day in order to make it so the math that checks out across these gets this to where you can close 20, 30 units a day. Uh, which would mean hundreds a day on this. um obviously then in conjunction with these but so we just need to crack that. So we have a senior copywriter that's like completely on this right now. It's like the only thing he's doing and then we're going to start testing positioning. But this in marketing land is for sure in my opinion because these have the highest show rate and the highest close rate these through here. Um I I just think that the and the economics are the best uh as long as the cost per acquisition stays in pocket which it doesn't do at scale with this one. Um so we need to crack something that right here we can keep the cost per acquisition low enough that it works. or the net cost or the yeah net cost per acquisition. So yeah, that's for that one. For sales, what we're seeing right now is back I just want to put this one on top because show rates is kind of like marketing and sales. Um but show rates is huge right now. I don't know what is going on. Um like clearly something changed. We have all these different launches that are happening. We have some changes that are happening in sales. All the automation should have stayed the same. We also have seasonality with it being June and fitness and 46 year old women and that kind of stuff with like kids stuff and summer and whatever where that does happen. But like I don't want to blame seasonality. So really leaning in on the marketing front on how we can fix these and on the tech front of what we can do with automations and shows. I think it's really going to come down to the framing. So we solve for this and get another 20 30 whatever percent back. Um because for whatever reason we're like literally 50% blended. All the ones that talk to a setter or come through these funnels or come through whatever are like 75 80%. But the issue is they're like not even claimed or they're not I'm sorry confirmed with a setter. So the setters are reaching out and trying to confirm them or trying to do it through here and they just won't even answer. So it's like they booked but then they didn't. So it's like you might as well cut your or double your cost per call because your cost per live call is literally double. So if you're getting, you know, $100 bookings is actually 200 for a live call and then your costs get all wonky and you already see that in CPA. But this is the biggest one right here. I think um management I we had some changes in management in the sales realm and that just always creates hiccups. Um, so we are working on this kind of like actively right now. More of a cultural like people side of things, less of a skill-based thing. Um, so we're solving for this right now, which then also leads to consistency. So we'll have, you know, 150k day and like a 50k day and then like 140k day and then like, you know, we're kind of back into that land a little bit. Um, it is a little bit better than it was. I don't know how how long you guys have been watching, but I'm on day likeund8 or nine in a row of doing these. And on first 20 30 days I was talking about how we would have like 30k days and like 80k days and now it's like 50 60k day and then like 150k days. So like we're in the right direction or back to the right direction but still this needs to be like hammered out so that we have consistency across a seven-day and that also is the same thing for availability. So we'll have a third to like a oneird to one half of the amount of availability on the weekends which is just not cool because then they get over booked then you're like burning cash because you're spending into it. um show rate stuff if you don't have setters on to confirm like we just have an issue with coverage so that also hurts the consistency so working on that and then once these are solved um oops and I forgot on here I can't actually type now but consistency and consistency in per in performance so making sure the offer rate and the close rate across team are in alignment that we're getting rid of people on team um you know obviously only ones that like are not performing um and can optimize for that but that comes through management and then volume once these are dialed in then it's like okay Cool. Now we can add two, five reps a month and scale into that, but can't do that. You don't want to I mean, there's just no reason to scale on like a shaky foundation. So, we are rushing um to get this fixed or to get this set up because this makes their job easier and then when their job is easier, these things come more natural and then you can push volume. So, it's kind of like still right here. I would say this is the number one lever. Um because what this solves for is the economics of this is this is a live call. So like the cost per live call. As long as we can keep that down and in pocket um with the actual obviously quality and whatever. So like get them to show high high quality, make sure all the framing and stuff is in there and then make sure the calls are in alignment. Like that's the true north right now with this. Um and then these are just like necessary things. And then we can increase the volume. If we can increase the volume, we can press 5 8 million a month I believe. Um just with the current setup and stack just more volume through it. Um on the fulfillment side, there's actually a pretty big one, but I don't have any charts for this. uh uh written out. Sorry guys, I just got back from a trip and I've been go go go go. So um tech and data on this, we never really focus on this. I never really focus on this and that is on me. Um but we do not have enough tech uh we did not have a proper tech setup for fulfillment of the product on the customerf facing side or on the internal data side of what we were storing. So we kind of had like multiple sources of truth. We had communication over here. We had um the platform they're all logging into over here. We have the billing over here. And like it worked again like you know thousands and thousands of active customers but it was time to centralize all the data and then make it so the stack is clean. So we are going through migrations of this right now. But this will allow for efficiencies in how we are able to like the the for example the client count per coach let's say it's like 50 right now. Um we are going to be able to essentially like double that or call 30 to yeah 30 to we'll just say double it. So it would be really cool. um the real targets like 30 to 50% is what I was going to say there um to increase and then keep cost the same because their job will be easier when it's all in one tool and there is software the software enables efficiency so we're focusing on that retention another big one that was an issue of stuff that happened from sales selling on you know selling in a way and using financing stuff that you know had them doing XYZ to get 24-month financing or all this for like an annual program um as well as how we were servicing the actual contracts we'll service them super super well for that first year but not focus focused on like talking about their year 2, three, five for life with us. Um, and that was a big thing. So, we shifted that up about four to six months ago and so now we have another six to eight months until that fully fleshes out for all the new people coming in who got that XYZ service who were framed in XYZ way. Um, retention is actually working pretty well right now, but um, we have a big thing in July where we do a big retention push that's like a special. So this one, but I just want more of an evergreen approach on here, more touch points, which does come from the Tekken data because we need to know the activation points. And then LTV boost, this is either through partnerships or self um of everything. I made a video on this yesterday I believe uh or two days ago that all around how can we boost more because the more you can fix this this piece right here the I don't want to say the less matters but like it isn't as integral that you're perfectly like hitting KPI um like perfect perfect KPIs on the hamster wheel of acquisition when you have continuous LTV boost and like forever customers um because you obviously make more money off the current customer that you already paid once to acquire so if we can focus on this and that is for us we rolled out a back-end product but we also So, we're going to launch two new things I don't really want to talk about yet. Um, but we are focused on doing those and I think we're going to do them in-house. So, we're just shopping around figuring out how we're going to do it. Uh, and when the timing of it makes sense cash flow-wise slash like size of volume, more so like volume. So, like once we hit XYZ volume, we feel like it'll make sense to do. Um, so we have like three different tanches of how we're trying to layer this in. basically as a front-end product increase uh post-purchase for anybody that purchase any of those backend after retention and then basically a continuity thing for the entire um customer base. So this is I this is like a leaky bucket situation where it's like every even if you're crushing this the more you sell like you're still not if you don't have this solve for you're just like there's just money left on the table. So right now this on the marketing side, this on the sales side actually that one's kind of hard because it might be this but uh we're gonna say this because it is just directly out of the box the biggest lever uh which actually comes from marketing. Uh fulfillment is this on what we can do with either partnerships or in-house and then the admin tech overhead piece is project management which leads to team efficiency. So this is massive for us right now. like we have so many talented people. Um, but I'm like in there trying to organize it or structure it and then trying to have them lead them and it's like they need like a PM inside the meetings that are like keeping up the ClickUp boards and doing all that. Like we have a lot of again really talented people at like their role. Um, but things can slip through the cracks. Things can get timelines pushed out. It can take five people to make one decision on like a simple thing. And we're starting to get kind of there. So like I need to solve for this now. So, I literally have uh interviews tomorrow to talk to people about just like how they do this and maybe hire one, but probably just like understand the structure of how people are doing this. Um because this is this is huge. Like we have a large team now and we want to focus on the team efficiencies and make sure that you know the person who comes in for $5,000 a month um assuming they're you know ROI justified role can make back you know a hundred a month or whatever math right so yeah those are the big like focuses focuses for us right now. So to recap in marketing, if we crack low ticket cold uh in the correct way, that'll solve the economics of the entire business because of the acquisition because it's kind of like the biggest percentage of new unit. Um so if we can solve for that with that piece, the show rates, so both from all of these as well. So these are basically lead funnels. This is a purchasing funnel. So you're you're talking to buyers versus leads. If you can solve for show rates, this would be a massive lever and like you know overnight 30% more in cash collected on the same volume if solved for. So that one is huge. Um consistency performances as well but I believe if we solve for this because the quality will go up because the intention will go up as well. Um that this will just kind of follow and then we can press volume but like in domino effect on the fulfillment side LTV boost we're already working on the tech and data and we're already working on this too but it's just like this is a much bigger game. This is like entrepreneur mode almost where you're starting things up and we don't want to necessarily be the ones to do it. We want um people in the team to feel empowered and have led it themselves. Um but also have like our eyes on it and kind of the the double check on making sure that these launch correctly and that they make sense. Um and then also just like deciding how aggressive we want to go on this versus like because you for a lot of these LTV boosts like you could just do partnerships where you're like oh someone with supplements will give me 40% or 60%. It's like, can we just take that and then, you know, press them over there and then make 10 grand, 50 grand, 100 grand from that versus, do you do it in house? If you do it in house, do you have 19 SKs? Do you have half a million bucks in inventory? Do you play that game? Do you play one skew game? Do you play? Right. So, we're just kind of like thinking through pieces of that. That's just one like sub examples where I said supplements, but like we have two or three of those that are like based on feedback we got from the customers um of our customer base are like massive. Uh we just need to figure out how we're going to attack them. So this is a big one because it's like leaky bucket again. If you acquire a ton of customers but you never have these in place, you're just losing the opport the just opportunity cost for money is just massive. Like if you look at our retention numbers on this last batch, like we probably I mean the quick math is 20 30 million on the table. Um of the last 78 million, we probably literally missed out on 20 or 30 because of how we didn't have things built in for LTV retention, all of that. And retention falls into the LTV boost bucket. So that's a big one. And then yeah, now where we're at, we've tried to have project managers in the past and just kind of hasn't worked for us because we weren't at the size we needed them and now it's funny because now we got up to the size and we don't have one. Um, so I don't really know that I want to throw another person into the team stack right now. But if it's somebody who can manage the people in terms of like all the projects and cross functional and at some level like I already do that. It's just I don't want to do that. Uh, and I don't want to focus on that in the future and be in all the meetings and like following up on due dates and doing all that kind of stuff. It's like, you know, I want people to be accountable to do that, but I also want someone to be there right next to them helping them structure these things out and build them into ClickUp or Asauna or whatever um you guys use, but we use ClickUp and then yeah, get the team efficiencies out and or just lean out the team if we don't find them. If we have someone come in and you realize, you know, one person is doing one thing a week, it's like no. So, yeah, those are our current ones. I like to talk about the wins and the losses. And right now we are a little bit on the struggle bus sitting stuck at this. Um not stuck at this. We did 1.5ish 1.6 then three and then this month we're pacing around three again. But if we crack any of these literally any of these we should be able to just press to five with current volume with current volume. So show rate being better will get us closer to four and some change and we would be able to push volume if that happened. Low take coal would change the economics completely. So the margin would just be insane difference um which would be huge. And then project management would be you know a slight cause on the overhead stack but if done efficiency if done efficiently this one kind of overflows into being able to manage this being able to manage this and being able to manage this. So I'm kind of looking at personally like this is my big lever number one because if I can do this then I can help marketing team be structured enough to roll this thing out and call it two weeks. I can have marketing team roll this out in the same two weeks because there's big enough team over there. And I can have fulfillment and um like ops team, product team working on this at the same time. So that's kind of where I'm at mentally with it. But hopefully this was helpful. I'm back in the office for a bit. Um and yeah, daily update. All the videos are here. www.rclog.comdoc. I think today is day 108. I don't know. 109 something uh in a row. I'm going to stop doing these daily soon. I don't know when, but one day I will and then I'll go to like two or three a week. And yeah, that's what I got. I got some other fun ones on here. Um, I do a weekly Q&A every week. If you have any questions, drop it on the request. I am doing a survey for info coaching people on what offers you have, where your cash collected is at, all that. Just because I'm trying to get survey data and see kind of like people who follow me in the audience, where they're at. I'm not selling anything. So, you can just check it out and uh you can put your contact info on the end if you want me to reach out. And then Rolodex is going to be anybody that I work with or refer out or whatever when people ask me for stuff. I just want to be able to send them a link. So sales agencies, softwares, whatever, all that kind of stuff. Don't go to it. I don't care. Um I'll make any referral for free. I don't I don't care. So that's that. And uh hit me on X or Instagram with any comments, questions, whatever. And leave some comments below this. I appreciate you guys and talk

# Why Your Funnel Isn’t Booking Calls (Live Q&A) | EP108
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYTvFp8Y7zw

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing our weekly weekend Q&A round nine. All these questions here were submitted to the request box over the last week. And today, we're going to answer every single one of them. Looks like we have a ton with context for people who are already running offers that are looking to scale. And then a couple people who are some beginners in here. So, I'm excited for this one. I think it's going to have a lot of golden nuggets. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 77 million actually in total cash collected. I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, we're going to kick this off again. Sorry for the audio. I'm on a bachelor party and it is early and I'm trying to knock this out so we can go have a boat day. All right, so starting on the first one, I'm in the dating niche for a specific niche of men. Any advice on how to get more leads via reals, copying viral videos? Um, via reals. So, no. I mean, I'm not we don't do a lot of organics. So, I'm not going to have any like specifics for you. But this is the same as if it's a specific niche of whatever. If you're trying to find architects, if you're trying to find women 40 to 60, if you're trying to find whatever you have to go where they hang out, you have to target them specific. So, in organic, you it's all about what you're saying in your messaging, right? So, it's all about the creative. It's all about what type of content you're putting out there that resonates with this specific niche of men. Um, and then, yeah, getting building an audience, and then having proper call to actions, having good enough offers that people want to. Um, so yeah, I mean copying viral videos. I'm a huge fan of modeling. So I love if I can find something that already works somewhere in XYZ niche or even in my own niche and then being able to, you know, replicate it with our own spin on it is very important too. Um, so yeah. So I mean I think that one's pretty direct, but um, Horosi has a good book leads. Like there's different there's a lot of different sources. There's organic, so you're just saying IG reels here, but there's 92 different ways you can get traffic. Like who else has customers that are specific niche of men? Can you do a partnership with them? um do some ail like an affiliate deal with them where you pay them $100 cost per acquisition or I don't know your units or whatever, but like say you have a 5k program. Can you pay them $1,000 for everybody they refer over that purchases? Like then you never have to run an ad, never make or like organic and like you want to have multiple sources of acquisition. So you do want to do your own stuff, but there's a lot of different ways other than like how do I make Instagram reels is kind of what I'm thinking. So how to work 8 to 12 hours a day locked in? I just get myself to work that long. The brain energy goes to me. Um, yeah, there's a lot of guys that talk really uh good about this. Mark Scales Brands talks on some of this. Becker has content on this. Um, a bunch of others have content on this, but in my opinion, what it's going to come down to, I mean, you could drink, this is not advice, by the way. This is not find whatever doctor advice or whatever you're supposed to say, but like dude, you could drink 12 monsters a day, sleep like two hours a day, and as long as you're working on something that you like actually enjoy or that you're like challenging you or that you like get energy from, you're fine. And like you can only do that for a season, but like there's all the classic stuff. It's like drinking off water. It's sleep. It's like, you know, no tech after x amount of time. It's take XYZ supplement. It's like eat what is good for your body. Some people thrive on vegan. Some people thrive on carnivore. Some people like all that kind of stuff. Move your like all the classics. But there's like, you know, mind, body, soul type things that are like the 8020 that you can do where it's like, you know, I have nicotine and caffeine right now. And you know, is that the best cleanest source of energy? Absolutely not. But like, am I fine? Yes. Did I sleep like three hours? Yes. Like all good. So like I enjoy this. So, I'm going to continue to do this. Um, my biggest thing with the 8 to 12 hours locked in is like what are you working on for 8 to 12 hours a day that's like needle moving because the bigger thing is like setting yourself up so you're working on high impact like lever pulls so you're doing things that are actually moving the business, actually moving your life, actually moving towards whatever goal or set or something like that. Um, I think that's the biggest thing is like doing something that you actually enjoy and doing things that have a feedback loop so that you get the energy back because you did XYZ it got XYZ result feeds the flywheel and you keep leaning that direction and then over time I mean again 8 to 12 hours a day locked in like as you start to scale up it gets more and more it gets much more difficult to find things to work on for 8 to 12 hours a day all day every day like I'm the classic I work 16 hours a day it's like I'm scattered as all heck right now and I'm like trying to get to a point where I have like only the top levers where I have leverage through team where I have leverage through tech where I have leverage compared to these other pieces. Um, or I'm in just the right vehicle that the hour, the dollar per hour comes out much higher. So, that's kind of my thought on it. Hopefully, that was helpful. But, paper call, how to get people who act to actually call. Example creative. The lander is usually the same, but how to get them to actually take action, not just bounce before after the click. Um, go and find Carlos. Carlos has I think I don't know if it's free or if it's like very affordable. Um, but he has tons of trainings on this. He has landers. He has offer things that are built into like his white label GHL that you can use that like already work, but most people, there's so many different ways to do this, but like most people do like a quizander. So, they'll ask a bunch of XYZ questions. They get to the end and it's like, "Hey, you qualify. Click here to call." Um, is like a very common one. Um, some people just do like a two-pager on ClickFunnels or whatever that's like, you know, apply for whatever stimulus thing, check, whatever. I'm thinking like ACA right now. Um, or like get, you know, $6,500, whatever they use. And then it's like click here to see uh click here to apply or click here to qualify. They click and then it's like you've qualified and then it's just literally a phone number. Like I know people who run simple two pages. So, but it is the uh um by media um on X talks about this as well on his stuff. But it's all about like the the continuity, the congruency throughout where you're at with the ad to the lander to the page that actually has a call to action. So, I don't know again if that helps, but like there's guys out there that do all they do is make content about this. So like I would go consume that. How do you phrase a sales call for coaching with the low ticket funnel? So for low ticket I think what you're referring to is we have an ascension funnel. So essentially someone's buying something that's low ticket that is an info piece that is like this big um that solves a like a problem but also just kind of introduces that this is only step one and then there's all these other things and personalization onetoone and all that. So we will take um I think that's what you're referring to. So on that on the tail end of that one second. Oh I'm going to kill these guys. There's like 12 phones in here all ring. Um, so for the ascension portion of it, so they'll buy a low ticket and then on the thank you page, it'll say here, click here to book your quick uh quick start guide or your I'm sorry, a quick start call, your onboarding call, your implementation call. And that is with a setter. And then the setter will have a conversation with them. It's like, hey, did you get your access to your things? They're 15-minute bookings. Uh, we actually use Zoom on ours. A lot of people just do it on phone number. Um, both work depending on your demo and uh kind of the the warmth of them in there. Um, so you will then uh position that call to be like, did you get access to your things? Okay, cool. And like why did you not apply for XYZ? Like why didn't you apply for whatever the big coaching program is or did you see on the site like all those testimonials? Like just FYI, like all those testimonials came from our actual top uh coaching program and then you position them over, you know, would you be interested in this? You qualify them. Do they have, you know, even the funds, the interest, the whatever? Are they the actual ICP? Like do they fit in that? And if you do good enough selling the low ticket that it's in alignment with the back end, then it usually like flows pretty well. So that's how we do ours. And those calls that come from the, you know, quick start call over to the uh closer call have the highest show rates and the highest close rate of anything else in the company. So the economics like crush. So hopefully that's what you meant. In your last video, we talked about backend offers that blast your LTV. I assume you mean up. Um how do how would you go about the process of starting a mastermind? Like what would be the first steps? Would you find someone already doing it? Get feedback from your existing clients and how and how little is too little when it comes to the day activities? How little is too little when it comes to the day's activities and how much is is going to go too in-depth? I don't really understand the back portion, but I made a video yesterday about this. So, essentially that the thing with masterminds is like it needs to be a lot of the time it's about who's in the room. So, it's like kind of garnered from like who's in there. So, it's both the community aspect and then also some education portion, some learnings that are different that are at a higher level. So like implementation kind of like it you hit kind of peak implementation level and now you have these people who are generally speaking I mean you can do it in any niche but it has to be your customers all have to be very they have to have some something that ties them together. They have to have golden thread. They have to have something that makes sense for why why they would ascend or stay in this bucket. Um so like a great example of this like Russell Brunson's. Um there used to be one that was really big uh that was in the info coaching space um that would go up and everyone was basically the category king. I literally made a video on this yesterday, but like for us, for example, it doesn't work because where are they going to send to? They're not all similar enough in the ICP. It's like what are you going to educate on or whatever. Like an event for us would work, but like a mastermind where someone pays 50 grand a year or 30 grand a year or 100 grand a year. Like I've heard crazy ones that go even higher. Um to have that you need people who are all similar so that they can like vibe together. They want to have to like pay to play. And then a lot of the time also it's like expertled. So, it's like they want the closer proximity and that's the closest proximity you can get to like the head hunt, the like the expert, the brand face, the person. So, that's like the most common way. Um, but usually again, you're going to send these people out of like a current offering. So, it's kind of like the back is literally the back end of the thing. So, you already need some front end or some, you know, high ticket someone in that realm. You need a lot of customers over there so that 10% of them ascend. And you know, again, there's different stats and all this kind of stuff, but like usually you want a bucket of people that are already in there that are like the highest level consumption because you're not going to run an ad or just drop something on organic generally speaking. You may be on organic. Um, but you are then going to, you know, have some 30k offering and you're going to have 15 people for it to even be a mastermind because you need people for it to be generally. So, hey Ryan, quick question on the call flow constraint. I'm selling a high ticket fitness for men over 40 using YouTube organic light retargeting. I'm averaging 500 to 700 unique visitors to my VSSL funnel per week and over 100,000 long torn. Nice, but I'm only booking one to five calls per week from this funnel. I know I'm getting the right demographic based on my YouTube analytics, but so I don't think the traffic's issue. Do you think this purely VSSL copy problem or could it point to deeper more fundamental issues of my funal or my content strategy? If you were in my shoes and saw this kind of cash call flow constraint, uh what would you look to first? Um so again, we don't have anything organic. I the thing with organic is like you have all of these pros. You have like this m you have this big audience. You have the consumption. You have the warmth. They're like layups by the time they get on the phone a lot of the time. Like you have all these different pieces that are really good. Um but you don't have sometimes you can have depending on your like content schedule and like the size and whatever consistency in how many people are booking a day that you would have with paid. So we do everything with paid. Um we are doing stuff with organic. We have this massive content engine that exists for mo uh uh middle and bottom of funnel. Now, just now we are starting to attempt to do some that are like outlier specific where we're just targeting all that for organic for long form on YouTube. Um, but yeah, the the consistency around that's an issue. So, 500 to 700 unique visitors to my VSSL funnel. Also, what kind of VSSL funnel are you running? Because if are you running a DTA, which works really well on organic if it's framed correctly. So, if you have essentially a headline that calls out the audience as whatever XYZ offer, you have VSSL on page and application button. Um, nothing's gated, no opt-in, no whatever. You're already getting the consumption from YouTube. Ideally, they're, you know, ideally not just like watching that one video, trying to apply and then like that's it. Like ideally, they've watched uh, you know, some of your content. Um, but if you just do that funnel, five calls for 700 is not good. Uh, five or whatever, five calls. Yeah. For 500 unique visitors is not that good. Um, right. Wait, let me do the math on this. Sorry. So 500 five on 500. Yeah, it's a 1%. That's what I thought. I'm terrible with zeros on the mental math. Um so yeah, 1% is not good. Like a lot of people get anywhere from five to 20. Like I think uh Jeremy on his said it was a 30% uh on a click to app. So like a page view to app on theirs on that type of funnel. So yeah, uh I would look at the VSSL, I would look at the headline. I mean like ideally if you're track I mean you're going to know better than if your organic is good enough and what it is framing and priming like framing and priming them for but you need the you need the continuity across right so like yes you can do this to get all the views but then when you do all your call to actions and all your places and spaces you get 500 to 700 people to click over to the page if then it's only through there I don't know the exact frame but like if you're getting like five applications and then five bookings through there like it's clearly of something that's on page so it's the offer it's the headline it's the VSSL it's in there. It's your application sucks. You have a tech problem. Like it can be literally anything. Um so I can't, you know, directly say on here. Um you can look at your VSSL stats like what are good VSSL stats. DTA funnels have way lower consumption because they're not gated. So there's no need for someone to like watch a lot of it um in order to just apply like they can just click the apply button. So a lot of common ones are headline, VSSL, application button, and like testimonial wall. Um, some do it without the testimonial wall, but yeah, it's something that happens on that page, assuming that the framing that they're coming into this for makes sense. So, if you're like, "Oh, get this free training versus like apply for my program." Like, very different intent when someone clicks on that. And you just have to make sure that that's all in alignment. So, you can DM me and we can go through this a little bit more, but just resubmitting both questions so I remain on the top of results. Thanks, G. I'm a 21 I'm a 20 year old sales setter in the info space with 13 months experience. Last month I brought in 250 cash as a setter. Previous was 150. Okay, so you're growing. Cool. Oh, nice. Upwards of 16K a month. That's pretty solid for That's very solid for a setter. Uh eventually move into closing 30K based on closer, but I'm thinking longterm update. I got promoted to a front-end closer. Short-term goal is stacking cash through sales. Long-term is building this. Would you would prefer learning under someone rather than starting my own thing? My question for someone with sales foundation who wants to transition into ops or marketing within info. What specific action should I take to my position myself in those roles? What skills should I prioritize learning? How do I demonstrate my value just beyond that? Yeah. So, I mean, literally talk to your person about that. I mean, a lot of times they're going to be like just close. Like be a sicko closer because as somebody who owns this or one of these and has sales team like I want my sales team to be closing. I want a closer to be closing. I want a setter to be setting. Um, but depending on your dynamic and your relationship within the company and all that, there are ways to learn internal. ways to just like, you know, network for no for a lack of a better word, but like with the people who are running those positions and pieces. Um, you also can continue to build up like the skill stack and the network within the space. Go in the places that the info coaching people hang out in. Go in the nothing held back groups. Go and talk to other people who are in sales uh who are other sales reps. Go and talk to um, you know, I I don't know why maybe you would be interested in doing sales management and like trying to scale that tier because as you have access to like more people essentially, you can get you can learn through proximity already directly. Um, but then the only other way is either get a job in one that's like market or uh what do you say? Ops. Marketing and ops. You're already going to get closer to marketing, especially if you start to go higher in like clo uh in sales. So, if you get into like sales management, for example, like you already are bouncing back and forth with the marketing team a lot. You can consume a ton of content around the marketing piece. Like it's literally endless uh on our little corner of the internet where you can learn how to do the marketing portion. But you either either need to like learn through proximity in your role slash like be paid to do it as like a job. Uh and whether that's in your current company or get a job doing it in another company, but like have some skills or like have a relationship with someone where they'll trust you or you know bet on you. And then the other is to just start your own thing. But starting your own thing is a lot is just a lot different. Um and I don't know what what you're up to. Number two on here, the company I'm working to working at is a B2C bisop offer in the info space. We changed sales process 6 months ago. So now it's ad evergreen webinar 2K front art and 78 sales cycle. The shorten 140 days to 10ish days rorowass much higher. Don't have the exact numbers on the front end. Still not break even. Company was okay with that because we're focusing on back end. Yeah, it's perfect. Month and have it been efficiency this month. Reached a teamwide 70% ascension rate. Yep. Solid. It's amazing. Gotten to a point where it's very efficient. So focusing on the front end everything paid media. If the goal is to maximize profitability and not increase ad spend, is it worth even trying to break even on the front end as opposed to increasing backend efficiency if something becomes break even or even profitable in the front end is possible? How would you go about doing it and need more context? I'm happy to find um no it makes sense. So like that model is like tried and true and just and crushes. So um the one 2Ks and then all focusing on LTV like yeah there are other levers to pull. There are potentially other funnel like models or structures. Um, but when you're collecting one 2K cash on a direct to cart, whether that's a VSSL, whether that's webinar, whether that's um I mean those are kind of the core too, but like whether you're doing that or like I know a lot of people for example that then like roll into outbound at that point. So it's like they have outbound because the economy the the economics makes sense to do it for that seven would you say 78k offer they'll do there. I know other people like because what you can either work on like the acquisition source, the acquisition model, but like the acquisition model of what you're doing now is the webinar is that one flow. You can get the economics cheaper to where you get a same quality but lower cost per lead for the webinar. You can get higher show rates for the webinar by optimizing. You can get higher close rates by split testing the actual webinar over and over and over again to squeeze another five, 10, whatever percent out of it. you I mean you can optimize the out of a funnel but the other thing and the thing that we like messed up on I think was that we did you know 71 million through one funnel just hammered it and then when it started to break we had nothing else like warming up we had no other messaging funnels whether the same funnel types or completely different like like a low ticket for example or a direct toart or I'm sorry a uh direct application so we didn't have other funnel types let alone having more of the same funnel types like another webinar that targeted whatever messaging that was like a different pocket of people or just even different messaging to the same people because some will resonate with something that's like you know make money from your laptop and do this and the other is uh you know how to be XYZ you know family man and and work from home you know there's just different models that you can say the messaging that aligns with it um so I would focus on that is having if you guys know this funnel type so well because as soon as you start changing things like uh DTA for example like there's no setter call it's straight to closer usually it could be a two call but it's just like a different flow so if you already have everything built around that flow of like the 2K they consume this you have I don't know if you said it in here but a lot of people I mean 70% ascension rate is insane so like that's super solid so I would focus on that and then I would also move into the other kind of like pieces and buckets of that um of trying to hedge on the actual marketing piece because you one you just want the hedge just in general but then two if it gets to a point where that funnel doesn't work you need something else set up or literally you go to zero or very very low because it's all just an LTV game at that point and that's the other thing is like, you know, uh you win if you can pay the most to acquire a customer. It's also like not a big deal, uh if you're not. And then all of a sudden there's something that's after the 7.8K that makes it so the efficiency is even more so. So you can pull all these levers like also at the same time to where instead now your LTV doesn't max out at the 7.8K, you have two, three backends, you have another level of ascension that's 30% to like we were talking about earlier, uh mastermind or software plays or whatever that you can make more person per customer. So the acquisition isn't like as constrained. You don't have to be on the hamster wheel of acquisition. And the other thing that I think is very important is to actually hedge on the front end because you just never know. Sometimes like the funnel can die for whatever reason. Sometimes they can be non-compliant. Sometimes you can have like these other issues that can arise uh where it is nice to have a low ticket as well. It is nice to have like a challenge cadence that you do every quarter. It is nice to have another direct to app and people will hit multiple of these too. It's like someone goes on the webinar but they don't buy but then they see this other one they apply direct. They already have some consumption from over here. So your cost, you know, your your blended cost through uh works out really well if you do that. So I would focus on that. If you were a closer right now looking to take the next step and start your own business, would you start your own offer info teaching sales or sales agency? Something completely different. Um I don't I don't know. I don't really prescribe to this like necessarily. So u I would probably do more so sales agency like sell it as a service because I think that has more legs. I think that's also like where the industry is going. I made a video on this. I think everyone should have a sales agency if you are info coaching focusing on cash flow and like just it just becomes the biggest headache in the business because of the headcount uh usually and like the consistency over there. So, in my opinion, I think that most people should use a sales agency. Not all and especially not if you just need a couple people, but like once it gets to the point where you have a manager that you have to manage or you before you have a manager, you're managing a bunch of closers and setters and efficiency. Like you're just missing out on potential like efficiencies or like upside. Uh if you are self-managing and you're not like, you know, really on it, like really on the ball, there's like this cost game like all the time at 20%. So, it's like if you can get, you know, all your closers are 10%. and you can like play this math game where it is actually more beneficial to be internal. But side rant. Um but yeah, I would probably do I mean everyone has a sales agency. You just have to stand out as good. Uh if you have the network, the relationship and you get three, four, five of those and they're doing you know 100k a month. You have a 20% you know fee and it's costing you 10 or 12 or whatever to fulfill on it. I don't really know the exact math of that. Let's call 5%. So you're making five grand in profit per and you have five of them. You're making 25 GS a month. Like maybe that's the play. But then you have multiple clients, you have multiple bosses, you have that whole game. Um, is there info, a lot of people do this game. So there's a lot of people doing like info sales on there. Um, or who teach info about how to get into sales and there's guys who crush. So like it's a competitive market, no doubt. But like if you can find your pocket like for example like Shelby sells like I think that's her I don't remember her name but or her her offer setup but um she found the pocket of teaching women directly how to do this. Um, and she's crushing. She's absolutely crushing. So, there's like a hundred dudes doing this and there's like her and then like I think like one or two other girls that I've seen at least on social that are doing this, but she's just like dominating because she found a pocket and did it. So, like you could do the same thing, not saying like gender, but saying like some other niche that like teaches people how to do uh there's other guys who do it um like how to do Medicare sales for example or how to do um you know uh whole life sales or like these other things as well. Not just like how to be a remote closer because that's kind of like been hammered through. But that's what I think. Uh, how to position demand capture offers. Selling insurance, employee benefits, cyber security. Uh, same as any other funnel. I think I don't really know. Position demand capture offers. Yeah, I mean I think it's just the same as any other offer. So, I'm not the full-on marketing guy. More so like the structure and math and whatever. Um, I mean, I get it, but selling insurance and employee benefits. Yeah, you have a good offer and you get people that are interested in the offer to it. So that is your advertising side or your lead flow side which again can be part which gives a 92 different things but that can be partnerships like I know a guy who has like um you know LLC's and whatever formation and tax structure thing and they do no ads they do no organic and all they do is have partnerships on the back end of some of these programs that do real estate or uh people who are starting a business for the first time and need LLC or uh people who do foreign um are trying to do like the tax game international and like they need different entities and stuff like Okay. And they only just do it through um partnerships. So they just found a bunch of people. They give them whatever riff, 10% or 50% or whatever um or a CPA number. So it's a,000 bucks to acquire a customer. And instead of having to run ads and pay what could be $500 cost per acquisition or $2,000 acquisition, they just lock it in a,000. They just do it through partnerships. So like businesses like this work well for that, like insurance and employee benefits. Like who do you partner with that has a constant inflow of people who need insurance and employee benefits or cyber security or whatever. Um, also a lot of these industries work well for depending on how hot ticket it is for outbound. So, cold outreach and sniping of that, but that all comes down to have a prop having proper positioning, having a good enough offer that makes sense, all that kind of stuff. So, hope that was helpful. I don't really understand that one, but you grow a business by solving bottlenecks. My bottleneck is just increasing ad spend. I'm already doing 4 to 5x. If today I launched new ads, I have at least a few days before I see an increase in ad spend worked. What do I do in the meantime? And even after the increase worked, it still it still won't take me all day. It's just a few hours a week in the meantime to overcome potential bottleneck number two like increase conversions. We're two co-founders. We spend 10 plus 10 hours per day. How do we spend the 20 hours a day we have? Do we take more projects to increase LTV improve? All right, I think I get what you're saying. Um, so yeah. Uh, so like for us for example, like if we increase spend today, like we need to do it for because what we're always optimizing for like kind of I mean true true is like how many units and calls per sale, but uh like the more immediate is how many calls are on day because for us sales team availability is like the the bottleneck. So it's like if we have 300 open spots today like we're doing ourselves a disservice if we have anything under 280 bookings on day right or whatever number. Um so for us it's like solving for that and then you know as bottleneck number one you could say the next is like just down the chain. So it's like okay that happens now you increase your spend your maps math is mathing and now it's like what lever it's like can we get those calls for a more affordable cost. Like there is one core thing that's broken and like right now for example like ours is going to be more so about sales because it's like whether that's volume of sales calls so like hiring more team and like doing that portion of it or is it the actual close rates and the efficiency of the overall sales team like are they at a sales per booking percentage which is a function of um show rate and uh close rate but are there levers we can pull inside there to get that more efficient because we need to solve for that before we increase the team because the math isn't mathing right is like there now the next piece is like okay cool now that's working now fulfillment is going is either going to break or is already breaking because there's so much inflow. So then you're solving over here and like I get what you're saying like you the biggest thing is like if you try and go and like oh I'm going to go do this other thing or like work on stuff just to like work on stuff like you need to be able to identify what I talked about earlier is like what the higher level things are. So like yes, if you can solve for things like increase LTV, that is going to say that is going to help you tfold in the future when you're no longer on a hamster wheel of having to acquire customers either in the bad times or the good times because you have a 10 to one on the back that you know it converts at 20% and then you fine-tune it and it converts at 35% now and you can focus on that. So like it's it's playing all these games, mapping all of this out and being like what is the current constraint and bottleneck solving for it and then yes understanding that okay so I I I just don't think that your current constraint necessarily is like spending more on ads and if it is like spend way more on ads then like lean into that like until something else either breaks or that continues to be it and you're constantly solving it constantly solving it. Um but I think that answers that. And then with partners, the big thing is like having it's fun to be like in the trenches together and like building stuff side by side, but it's also good to have people of like complimentary skill sets. So like one person's really good over here and one's over here so you guys can both like do that versus two people working on the same thing. Um it's always fun to like brainstorm and like come up with stuff. But if you want like if you're looking at you both as like how do I spend my hours or like where's my efficiency? That is in the conversations that is in the actions you guys are both actually individually taking. Um, and making sure that there is, you know, differentiation like or or when you guys do work together, it's, you know, a 5x, not a 2x because if it's a 2x, like, you know, it's not it's not that fancy. So, I think that answers your question. Um, this whole like then you're focusing on 10 different things. Yeah, I mean, you need to track all the metrics across, but like focus on solving one until it's solved, unless something's on fire and breaking and then that's your bottleneck. So, like list them all out, but like you know, is my cost per acquisition $100 and I want it at 70? It's like and it doesn't, you know, that's the biggest lever. Solve for that. You're solving for that. You're solving for that. Something lights on fire over here. You go fix it because that is truly now like the fire needs to be put out. And then you solve for that. And then you come back to this until you get this one right. And then all of a sudden now you have your $7 CPA, but your LTD is $200. And you're like, "Okay, cool. How do I get that to $2,000?" And it's like, is there partnership availabilities? Are there offers that we can create? Now all of a sudden I have to do the whole offer creation or how we can fulfill on it. And it's like these different projects go in these es and flows. And then as you get team too it's like prioritizing the projects which is the next question on here but like prioritizing the projects in what order so that you are doing things for the business that I mean generally speaking usually around cash flow but like or future cash flow targets. Um so you want to focus on the things that are actually going to move the needle. So project management um on this we've actually have not done a fantastic job of this. So we've had different project managers that are in house that we've tried and it's just been like they slow us down or like they just like want to create a hundred item checklist for something that's so simple and like a clickup board. Um, we've moved. We were at Air Table, which honestly was my favorite. And then we went to I don't know what's next, but then we ended up on ClickUp. We had so much stuff in ClickUp. I'm like, "All right, cool. I can just rock with this." So, when I started to lean in and take over more ops, I basically built out using like an EOS structure, an ids list that is your classic like um what's in the parking lot or open, what is in to-do, once it moves from to-do, we assign it to someone and it gets a due date and then it moves into in progress and done. And then inside there, they'll use the subtask to do that. Um I am already finding with like the team size and all that stuff like I don't want to be the person who is like building the boards or doing that kind of stuff and they are not necessarily good enough at it. Like we have very creative for example over on marketing like they're not great at doing the systems portion and like the due dates and the breaking them down SOPs. So I actually have an interview with someone on Monday for project management which is like a light level mid-level ops. Um we don't need like a full-on operator. Um, but we do need someone who can kind of come in and like make sure the lists are up to date, follow up with the right people, get something that, oh, it needs to be due by this because this then allows this next person to work on the next piece. Uh, oh, we need graphics for this thing. Okay, but or we need this presentation deck. And it's like this person builds it, but they need the assets. Or a great example is like uh when we do a funnel build, it's like someone can build the page, someone can put the copy on, but it's like you need the copyrighter to do the copy. You need someone a graphic designer or whatever to do like the the assets on page. You need to make sure the offer is done in the product land. You need to make sure that these different pieces and different ones require like you can't finish the page until the assets are done. Copy can maybe be the first thing in, but it's like still not live. Then you need marketing tech to come in and make sure that everything is good and that all the tech is enabled and that it pushes into the CRM. So like it comes in these like flows. So right now we use ClickUp and it actually works well. like we're still pumping stuff out, but like I want someone in there who's like managing this and who has like reporting on this and it's like where are people at? Where where's teams efficiencies? Um you know so and so was responsible for this project and it's falling on its face three times and it's like okay that person either needs to be off the team or not in charge of projects because they need to stay in there just be a copywriter or whatever. So that's our example. Uh what does messaging and funnel look like for disqualified leads? Do you send them to a low ticket offer? Yes, kind of. Um do you have a page that says something like we'll reach out but you never actually follow up? Kind of. So for us, and not this is not necessarily like the right way to do it, but like we just threw this together because we were getting too many bookings. So we need to So we split them into DQ and qualified. For us, there's one financial qualifier on there that's like basically very apparent like they're they're basically never going to close. So we push them to a DQ booking uh until we're almost at capacity, until we have like 20% left on capacity. And then we only allow in the quality bookings. And the DQ bookings e no longer can book, but they'll go to a page that's like, hey, we still need some more information based on your application. So and so is going to reach out, which is an AI bot that does text them. and then it pushes them. It's like or you know click here you also qualify for this whatever XYZ low ticket and they'll go there and that'll pick up a couple sales. Um and then we believe that if someone messages and goes back and forth and has all this context like based on the stats that person has more intent and more interest and whatever and even if they haven't didn't hit XYZ financial qualifier. Ours is kind of soft too because it's like how much have you invested in yourself in the past not like how much cash do you have? So like they could still afford it and like we've run lead on it and there are people in that pocket who can afford it. So if they have the intent high enough like they can still find their way to book and that's how we've done in the past. So um can you give an update on sending with iMessage versus Android? Are you still using iMessage? Have you seen an increase in response rate? Is it working? Do you have a specific platform you recommend? Um yeah. So I like blue send. It's kind of expensive. Tell Sam Queen. Hit him up and tell him I sent you because I want more lines and I think he might give me a riff but thus far they give me zero dollars so FYI. Um but send's been good. I think they're kind of like the pioneer of a lot of these. There are other ones like link. There are other I don't remember the other names, but link is another one that plugs into GHL. So for us, we right now are basically talking about moving every single closer over there so all the closers can have blue lines. Um because I think that'll be a big lift in show rate and um like conversation rate with them, which is like the thing I'm optimizing for. So if we can hit that, then we're good. Um but right now we only use it still for that same thing I made in the video, which is for uh so basically no one logs in the platform, no one uses it, it's just API calls. So, we just use it for the AI bot that has uh uh communication with people who are app no bookings, but that volume has vastly decreased since we've increased the setter team because they dial them and they turn her off, the her the AI bot off. Um, so we've focused on that for us thus far. Um, so yeah, but I do think we're going to move them over and I also think we're going to move the setters over to like a mass dialing thing. So, we'll have setters that are in this mass dialer thing, which I think doesn't have SMS, which is like a whole another show. And then we have the main dialing. Right now, we use Alaware and that's for everyone. We have every everybody CS closers and setters on there. And then we're going to put probably the closers just on blue because I think that's the higher highest lever point and the volume wouldn't work for setters. So we can't do it because it's only 50 contacts per day per line that you can use on blue on any of these platforms right now. Appreciate all the content. Nothing else like it at the moment. Please don't add edits. I won't. I have a client who has a bizapp offer teaching how to flip cars on the side. Full-time jobs, make an extra 1050. I have a 25% rev share, $1,500 offer. Uh they have a free community and 5K members trying to focus on building out a paid channel. What would be your approach? Um current setup is add this book a call and the current yeah $25 calls is great. So I wouldn't change anything. I mean assuming the quality is there but I don't know you DM me on this or ask another question on here because yeah I mean it sounds like a great opportunity for you and it sounds good but I don't know what's bottle what is the bottleneck of this and where things are breaking. Um because $25 calls are great unless they're like terrible quality or they never show or whatever and you're doing like all this massive volume and you have to have 15 closers and you're still only like squeezing out like this much like so yeah I would uh I I need more information on this but if you're getting qualified calls for $25 that'sing amazing and that crushes especially if you get you know stats are the true true is like 70% show rates and like 30 30 plus% live call close rates are like dialed um and then you know ours are lower than that on both those FYI but um that cost per call is crazy low for a you know $1,500 $100 offer. $1,500 offer. You can sell that direct. So, there's another game where you are just trying to sell this direct or you have this in pay plans or you have even lower ticket than this and then there's an ascension game. Um because 1,500 is kind of like that weird price point where it's like it's a lower purchase. So, like you need a webinar maybe for like a direct toart or like a long form VSSL or you need to increase this price and do it over the phone still because 1,500 is cheap. We sold it info for $1,500 for a long time over the phone. not for a long time, but years ago when the cost made sense and we were getting like, you know, sub $100 calls and selling a $1,1500 product that had like a very high cash collection rate on payment plans. Um, and that crushed for us, but it was just info. So, there was like no fulfillment, which looks like yours course and group coaching. It's very very uh affordable at volume like per unit to do. So, yeah, send me more info on this, but you I just need to know like this could work, but again, that is pretty low. I think you could actually sell it for higher and make more of a spread. Uh, how do you deal with feeling uninspired? I sat down at my desk every day with no idea what to work on, no idea what to work towards. I'm already making money that I know what to do with to be honest. More money than I know what to do with and I hit a lot of my goals. Yeah, dude. You just got to find something that's like exciting to you. Like, I've talked about this a couple times on this call on this call on this uh video, but it's like what do you enjoy doing? Like maybe you are one of the people who's like, "Cool, I make 100 grand a month and like I'm chilling and like that's so like all good." Like I don't know. I don't even look at money really like that anymore. like it's more so like the game of it and the progression that piece and like what actually excites you. So if you're not in inspired on that piece like at some point it's like who cares like get it to the point where you don't have to you know work on it eight hours a day if you're uninspired by it. So like you know fix it in that way but I think that's kind of the core piece like work on something you actually care about. Um and then also just like it doesn't even have to necessarily be work like people have plenty of like work life balance to do this. I'm just not one of them. Uh email deliverability issues. is we get about thousand leads per day uh from paid traffic and consistently have email deliverability issues. Too high spam rate scores for the past three years. We have so many email subscribers but I can't contact them. We don't spend spam. We only send one email per week at most. Yes, people just don't want to hear from you. So typical email open rates are 20 30% plus click rates 1 to 3% uh for the automated sequences that are all contextual. And then same thing the broadcasts are even higher and those are twice a day every day. So list size active 100k plus. Let's just say we have 1 point something in total CRM on there. Uh how do you know your average spam rate on Google? Yeah, I have like Z like like basically zero. So we have very low um I can pull it up and like if you want to DM me, I can give you the exact number. Um but it's extremely low. So we've done a very good job of this. Everything is contextual. People opt in only for XYZ. We only send them XYZ. um because these people don't want to hear from you if you're getting spam uh rates uh or like they're opting in for whatever through a brand and you're sending it from something else that doesn't make sense. Like there's some something is going on here. You have something broken um because you should get there. Now, it is true that like leads stop opening and clicking and they fall off the list. So, you only send to the hot pocket. So, it's you know 90day click, 30-day open for example is like a very common one. Um and some stuff like that. Um but yeah, just send me that. as somebody who probably leaves uh cold receives a lot of cold outreach. What is an offer, lead magnet or even copy itself that stands out to you? What would they need to say or offer? Not immediately market as spam, be open to engaging. Yeah, just something that's a good offer. So, it's literally this. It's like what is a crazy good offer and that is completely contextual and dependent on the person and the time. So, like I get a lot that are like I've answered a couple that were around like how people were going to do AI automations because I talked about that specific like that was something I'm looking for. People reached out and said they'll do all my automations or whatever. So, like I've I've entertained some conversations over there. Um, but again, it's just like what's important now or like what what fits in there now. Um, I got to zip through these. Everyone is literally leaving right now, so I have to go. Um, I ran an agency for years and shut it down to co coaching. I actually might come back to these cuz these guys are all like popping out here. But as someone who probably receives a lot of co Oh, I'm sorry. I've ran an agency for years and recently shut it down to switch to coaching. I'm going to keep my avatar the same and want to scale to scale with meta ads. I'm going to still have some done for you elements which would include a full funnel and VSSL script and the rest will be online courses. I'm going to start running ads off the bat and then focus on YouTube long form for that position from your POV. Anything I should consider here? Anything you do different? No, I mean that totally makes sense to me. Like coaches do like that is a good pocket. Um AK price point like yeah, you just got to test like I mean I I agree with the idea. Um this is how a lot of people work in it. So yeah, you just got to get it going. See your stats in the beginning. Make sure you track everything and then you understand like where everything's at because you're doing this on a phone call like I think right scale with meta via cell phone. Yeah. 8K offer. You're likely doing it over the phone. So you'll gather a lot of feedback on how you can change marketing and scale into it. So I'm a sales rep at this company offer space. Okay. This is the same one I already answered. Same one I already answered. Oh, we're doing all these. Yeah, let's go. We got time. Uh how do you set goals to stay motivated business? Not get caught up in the revenue hamster wheel. I'm making 120K 120 to 150K per month and have surpassed my original goal. I felt stuck for the past year on what I should be reaching now. Yeah, it's just like what do you want to do? So, there's a lot of questions about this which is very interesting. But yeah, like mine has always just come now down to the goal of progression on this. So, it's like skill set and stacking and uh how do you turn that to 200 and not just for the sake of turning it to 200, but like maybe you as a person need to change XYZ in order to do that or you need to develop the skill set of being able to have a team infrastructure and only work two hours a week because you have a team that fully runs it. Like there's just different levels to this and always like how much time do you spend in it? uh what is your skills to stack in whatever how do you develop AI so you only have two employees instead of a 10 like there's always different levers and games to play and then it's like a much broader question of like what do you actually want maybe that's fine and now you just want to go travel and do your thing like do that like who cares so it's really up to you and what it comes down to the goal of it but yeah don't just sit in front of your desk for 10 hours a day because you feel like you have to and it especially especially if the math just stays the same because if the math stays the same either your skill set's not there to grow it the desire is not there to grow it or you're just like you're just wasting time like you might as well be doing what you actually you want to do, which could be literally anything. Um, but yeah, I mean, I would I would just continue to lean into that target. So, next one, turning YouTube videos into podcast and which one has the best audio traffic volume? I have no idea. We use Oh, I'm going to blank on this so hard. Uh, I don't remember what we use actually, but we use one and we just hit a million viewers on our main core or listens or whatever on our main podcast, but it has no distribution other than the main platforms. So, all we use is the classic Spotify, podcast, uh, YouTube, whatever, and we just post them through there. So yeah, I don't know. I also haven't turned mine into podcast which I want to do and I have someone messaging me right now and it's like you know thousand bucks or something to convert them all and I just like or I just need to sit down and do it. So um yeah, but I don't necessarily have direct answer for this. I do know that these crush though and that more people like I get a lot of that are like oh can we I want to listen to your stuff at the gym but you know I don't have YouTube premium or I want this. Can I just turn to audio? And I haven't done that. So if you're starting from zero today what would you do? Break it down to task goals. I am not breaking this down for you in quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily basis. Um, I I've made a lot of videos uh about this or other Q&As's. I would do the exact same expert business model. Um, I would find somebody who's already crushing it. Maybe you already with an audience or an audience. Um, reach out to Josh Gavin. Tell him I sent you. Um, and he has one that's called offerpublisher.com, I think is the one. That one is for beginners. It teaches you how to basically run this business model. Um, and that's how I would start in this zone. I also do like lead genen and stuff, but it has a cost accured with it. And I don't think that that beginner should start with it because you're going to spend 10 grand or whatever $2,000 or $500 on testing ads and it's not going to work and you're going to be out money more so than out time and service that you could provide through service. How do you deal with fear? I'm a beginner in agency and I want to ask first question on sales calls interacting. You just bite it. You just you just bite it. So if you have the confidence in it with like that you can actually fulfill on it if you're a beginner in agency. If you don't have it, you need to either fake it till you make it or literally just be so real with people and just be like, "Yeah, I literally have no uh direct experience with this and I'm getting started with it and how about we just do a performance fee and I'm going to run all this stuff and just spend all my time doing it and then I just want an X percentage or when we hit 10% I want, you know, five grand or whatever and then it's easy because you're not selling anything. They don't have to pay you anything. You don't have to fake anything and then you can just have that conversation." So that's how I've always done it is just like performance base everything because I didn't have the confidence to do it even if I did have the skill. So, that's an easy one. Best business start with no experience. Same thing. I would go to offerpublisher.com or whatever. Tell Josh or honestly just DM Josh because it's kind of specific. He has other offerings. So, um self-doubt, procrastination, not knowing what to start. Same thing. Um self-doubt, procrastination, those are things that can be solved. They can be solved through micro actions that you can continuously do. For example, I'm going to go to the gym every single day. You need to like be able to trust in yourself. So, I'm going to wake up at 5 every day. And you don't wake up at 5 every day. Like, you can't even trust yourself. um everything starts there and then then funnels into your skill set and whether you believe that you can fulfill on your actual skill set um and do that then you do that a couple times and you're like oh wait I'm good at this too and oh wait I know that I can get people uh leads or I can get people clients or I can do whatever. So that's a core one daily update find all the other videos here on the dock. Um I have some other links and stuff but I got to zip because we're going on a boat and I think literally they're about to pull out of the driveway. So you guys rock. I appreciate you. Hopefully this was valuable for you and you got some insights and I'll talk to you

# Everyone Copies the Frontend… But THIS Is Where the Money Is | EP107
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpZxM2Wc24k

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about info coaching businesses that have massive back-end monetization models. We're going to walk through a couple examples of how we usually get customers and what they usually buy in info coaching, but then some weird back-end monetization models that I've seen in the financial space using masterminds, sports, and then how we are doing it with our version. And sorry if you hear some crazy stuff in the audio, in the background. I'm at a bachelor party, but we still need to do our daily video. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 75 million in total cash collected and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, building cool So, let's get into it. Uh to start on info coaching, so these are the main core ones. I I split it up with the red and blue here on organic versus paid, but essentially for an organic, this is very very classic for info coaching. You're going to have organic traffic source, your normal whatever 100k followers on XYZ. you're going to push them a lot of the time to a direct to cart info product. So, it's going to be something that has little to no fulfillment uh costs or needs. It's going to be a pre-recorded course, community, all of that. And it's going to be under $2,000. So, people can purchase it direct on direct to cart. And then what a lot of people will do for their backend for the monetization will do high ticket. So, they'll sell some sort of u basically usually just implementation that's further on this. So, instead of doing something that is done, you know, as is just like out of the course where you just do it yourself, the implementation goes up higher and that's done through high ticket. So, it's done with you, it's done for you in some capacity. Okay, so this is where most people like stop the gambit. Um, I am going to talk a little bit on here on the mastermind one um as an example. A lot of people then also will just go straight to high ticket. It needs a sales team um generally speaking because it's an over over 2K. Um you can technically kind of mix these and like have direct to cart that is high ticket but it's a little scarcer. And then we're just going to say same thing with paid which is a little more difficult um but very very consistent and scalable. So we're just going to get straight into this on here on info coaching direct that has these. So the ones that I've seen directly are ones in the financial space. So people always ask me what all the time like what would I start, what would I start? And again, sorry about the audio. We have people running around all around me right now. But um so financial wise, let's use these as an example. So insurance is the one I talk about all the time because I saw it. I actually ran a VSSL funnel that was similar, you know, to this. So essentially it was running um paid ads. We actually did some cold outreach at the same time, which is kind of crazy. It's the only time I've ever done cold outreach. Um but it was a specific niche and we were helping them solve for taxes and retirement. So, basically, how to pay no taxes in retirement, which was uh using whole life insurance. So, we modeled this whole thing around, built this whole VSSL uh funnel, opt-in funnel. So, name, email, phone number, opt, they go, they watch a VSSL, they apply, book a call. Um the big issue with these a lot of the time is the consumption and the warmth. But once you crack it and once you can get them in to either buy something low ticket, because if you're trying to go direct and just like have them put $3 million in a whole life policy and they've seen, you know, a 12minute video of you and then applied to talk to you, like it's just not going to work. So, I just had a video with Jeremy uh Haynes and he talks about this a lot is the consumption, the consumption, the consumption, getting ahead of, you know, all the objections before they become um or obstacles or whatever before they become uh uh objections in the sales call. Um but yeah, so they need the trust and the awareness with you. So, insurance a very very good example of this of who has done this. Um I don't want to say exact names. I think I've said them before on accident, but essentially they ran a uh paid directtoart funnel. So, they were running uh paid advertising to a funnel that was how to become financially free in 10 years or less, I'm pretty sure was the framing of it. They watched this big VSSL or it was actually a webinar and then pushed them direct to cart to either a$1 or $2,000 product. Once they got into there, there was a higher rung, but what they did is they leveraged monetization method one, which where they then talked about this vault. Use the vault, use the vault, and it was actually whole life insurance. Okay? So, then everyone's getting whole life insurance, which these guys are then them or partners or whatever are licensed to sell whole life insurance. So they make these huge commissions on this and then you know in insurance it can be whatever 10 years of commissions or something. Um they stack on top of each other. Then from there they were then telling them how to because the whole thing was around how to essentially become financially free by having passive income that overtakes your uh expenses, right? So basically doing it through rentals. So they taught people how to use this vault to do this real estate portion. So everyone got this then they taught them how to do real estate and then in the real estate thing they also had like I think it was a fund on that end or like fix and flips and all this. So they're making monetization there and then one of them I think was a fund. So I think there was three on the back of this. But it was massive. Like you can do so much size with these especially just this portion like uh for example the um the insurance portion. Another one of someone I've seen do this. I'm just going to stay in this financial one um is the taxation one. So there are guys that were at um Onyx Singal's mastermind that do a taxation program. Theirs is very funny because they'll run paid and it's uh theirs is paid direct to high ticket and in their high ticket uh it's basically like yeah no financing no whatever if you have to use financing to pay for this like you are not somebody who qualifies for this and just not going to work. Um so they sell direct there and then they have monetization 1 2 3 4 that are essentially these different like partnerships that they have. So once you get people that are in the rung, the big thing here that I'm trying to get to is that it's the person like who else has your same customer. So if you have who else has your same customer and you're not building like enterprise value on this like these partnerships that you can make are massive. So somebody who comes in and then has your exact 60 to 65 whatever or let's say 40 40 to 60 year old um high net worth individual. They also need an estate attorney. They also need you know XYZ. they also get trusts or whatever, you know, I mean, like they do all these different pieces. They need a CPA, they need a whatever. Like, so you can then refer these out for large sums of money depending on like who the who the actual client demo is. All to say back in the beginning who your target of info coaching is is like the biggest biggest thing here. So, if you can do it for wealthy individuals, if you can do it for individuals that grow into XYZ spot and then have large businesses, uh if you can do it in basically any capacity to where they then have the opportunity or already are like wealthy individuals, um and we're going to get to that down here with the sports example of like somebody who has the um capacity or the um the ability to get to the point of making large large sums of money. So, yeah, any XYZ large business thing. Another really good example of this is there's a guy who does insurance specifically for like snow for example. So it's like all the snow guys know each other. All the landscape guys, whatever these like massive shows, but if there's the guy that becomes that, he can do these like mid tickets or high tickets that are, you know, come in here, learn how I grow XYZ, but then also monetization methods because everyone needs insurance, everybody needs, you know, payroll, whatever, you know, all these different examples where they then use partnerships to like null them out. So that's an example in the financial one. I would definitely do it in this insurance space. If I was to do it again, like I literally the people I met were like, "Oh, you can do this with annuities and hundreds of calls. You can do this and this." So that's one. Mastermind is the classic one, but I want to explain how it can like the math behind it and how it can absolutely crush. So if you have what a lot of these guys will do is like paid, direct to cart, high ticket. Um like the an example I can use is like whole Gordon's like his crushes. Um but so they uh will have this normal info coaching ladder and he actually has this uh interesting two two place two-sided marketplace, right? So like they'll have paid direct to cart. They'll teach someone how to be a sales rep. They'll then have well there's kind of like multiple offers. His may be a bad example because his is like really intricate and like cool and very cool how it's set up. Um but so if it's let's use who's a good example like Russell Brunson for example. He has uh a ton of these that are like these massive ladders up that go from here until you're in this high ticket program and then they have essentially like an inner circle layer one. They have an inner circle layer two three four all the way up that can tear up. And when you're doing this, you're like what a lot of the time it's sold as is like you're climbing this top tier and wrong. You're making more money along the entire way and you're learning new skills that become there. So the framing was always like category king. So everyone at this phase learns how to do xyz. They all stay consistent with you know basically let's say it's teaching you how to get clients. Okay, everyone gets from getting how to get clients here. This next layer of it of the coaching and the massive backend. You've already paid to acquire them as a customer. You've already paid your sales rep. ever the natural next step for them is to then learn how to productize a service or for example then the next layer is how to be like the category king for your thing. So, it's like all these people are all kind of, you know, overlapping niches um or are, you know, there's a few of them and then one or two will rise to the top and be the guy for, you know, acquisition of leads in the landscaping space or the guy for life insurance, uh, high ticket or, you know, I mean, like all these different models and then they go into here and how the math works on those is nuts on the mastermind level on the back end because you'll have a hundred people in at whatever 70 grand. It's like $7 million and let's say you have a 50% margin on it because there's some crazy cost to fulfill. You basically give them the offerings up on your way here or piece and part them for whatever the specific person needs. But the monetization on it is so large. I mean like if it's 50% it's $3.5 million added in profit that again you're just not going to get in the same it's going to take a lot more work uh after. So this is like what it's where you can get this all comes down to like LTV to CAC ratios and like how big you can get the LTV. But if you can build a model like this and always start over here just like you have to hammer this and make sure this is great to then you know reap this and get more uh juice out of it over here. But yeah, it's a really really big one. So masterminds are a big one. Um an example like that doesn't work for us. So like these for example don't work for us because our customer base is kind of more broad to where it's like what is the next layer of mastermind? What is the next and I'll get into what our version is um but what is that for there? I know other people who do like specific income qualifications for um XYZ service and then it kind of does boat itself to have mastermind or higher tier because it's like oh then you're going to hang out with other people who are crushing it that are all very very similar to me. Like that's the thing is if you have this like broad like if you're an agency and you have nine different niches um it doesn't make sense to like you know put them all in the same room. If you're uh you know teaching how to do sales reps for uh for final expense insurance and you build this up it does make sense to have all the top guys like they all want to hang out. They want to learn from each other. Oh, you're crushing it. You're crushing it. Same way that conferences work. Same way that all that kind of stuff is like you want to hang out around people that are doing the same. So, the little things you find the one three 5% at that scale are like hundred tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars uh if not millions of dollars when they add up. So, that's one. This is a really unique one um that I actually heard about relatively recent. So, let's use an example of um soccer. So, let's use like soccer or football or whatever you want to call it. Um but say you have uh training for goalies. Okay? Okay, so you're teaching people how to be like the best goalie ever. So you can have paid ads or let's say you have this big organic following and you want to launch this. You have some sort of uh direct to cart that's some 2K product that teaches them how to do XYZ or how to I don't I don't even know probably bad example but like how to stop 80% of goals that come at you or how to um deny every single, you know, penalty kick or whatever it is. So you teach them how to do this and what you're really teaching them in in this to do is you have different tiers. So you have like the high school kids, you have the college, you have the like pro or whatever and they all have different results, but you're helping them get to the next tranches or like become allstars or become whatever. So you can sell direct to cart things to them and then pretty easily then upsell into a high ticket or you can even go direct to high ticket. So something that's five grand a year, 20 grand a year or whatever to help them do it and then you're matching that to what the ICP is. So whether that's high school, college or whatever, then you can match it to that. Okay. And where this gets crazy is you have like so you have those different tiers that you can service and generally speaking like pretty solid business model and I know exa I know people who do this. I don't want to like dox exactly what their setup is but like are crushing with this model in sports for like a specific position. So like again let's use soccer soccer goalie as the one. But the next trunch of this is this agency style model. And I've heard of people doing this before. So like someone just said this to me the other day and I was like oh yeah it makes a lot of sense cuz like I've literally seen it play out. I've seen it happen in entertainment world. I've seen it happen um one other time in the sports world, but essentially once you have this book, it's like who else who else wants my customer? Who else has my customer? Who else wants your customer is like the professional leagues. Who else wants your customer is like the main large entertainment p like district and like think about how the agencies and the agents work inside the entertainment industry or the sports industry. They get these percentages of like the tens of million dollar contracts and you know maybe those are the larger ones. I'm not fantastic with sports. I don't know why I use an example. Like using that framework, you then go from here from making, you know, a,000 bucks per to your LTV being in the high thousands, tens of thousands to the blended average when you have 10% of them that then go into the pros and you get, you know, x percentage of 2 million or 5 million or 20 million or whatever on these contracts and all the other inflow that then you get because everyone knows about you here. So it comes back and it exists as organic referral slash whatever like this beast just like feeds itself. So, that is a huge one. The agency portion of it um that I've heard of that can like really crush all of this. I'm gonna go into our version now and then we'll cut it because I got to go because everyone's being loud and rowdy. Um but the other one um is basically just the idea of having something that has a massive monetization portion where somebody can either make a bunch of money and you can get a percentage where there are a lot of uh similar people that you can charge basically have in the same room where there are financial products or something that is very large high ticket. So again, same thing like getting a percentage of a larger deal. I've heard people do this in real estate that have crushed it because they get portions of funds. I've heard people do this in buy sell businesses that have done it and gotten on there. Um Roland Fraser talks about about like consulting for equity. Like essentially you can offer service that you already have for equity, which is like, you know, kind of same thing as consulting. At a certain point, if you have the right person who is buying your product, same idea that if you sell low ticket and you sell 10,000 of them, but it's like not in congruency with your high ticket, then it won't ascend. It's the very it's the same It's like if you have to sell to somebody that can either become or already is somebody who has this influence, this wealth, this whatever and then can take them it can go to the next trunch. Okay. So like what our version of this in women's fitness. So for us thus far we've always just done this. So we have done or this one I'm sorry. So we've run paid ads to high ticket. So we have this large um large onetoone coaching program um that's annual. We then actually just sell the same thing on the back end. So we'll just do like recurring. So it's a renewal for this. What we just rolled out was monetization one is what I'm calling it for like another back end. So it's a low ticket. It's um I'm sorry it's not low ticket it's a downell continuity. So it's around half the price and they can stay with uh group coaching instead of one to one. So fulfillment for us is extremely easy. And then a lot of people still want that because it's like oh I don't need the one to one touch point. I don't want to pay that cost for year two or three or whatever. Um I already got what I needed for the personalization excuse me but they need the other portion. So or they need they want to stay in there. or they want access to the app community, whatever. So that's like monetization one. The next one we're layering in is supplements. So people already do this. All of them already take supplements. It's like why aren't we getting our piece? So for normally what I would say is just doing this with partnerships. So a lot of people will do this with partnerships, but for us we're trying to build like equity value and make it so this thing is like in-house, not just oh we have a contract with so and so where we get 40%. So monetization 2 then becomes that it becomes um in-house version of like supplements or like hormones or peptides or GLPs or stuff like that. Like we don't prescribe to certain pieces of that. So that's just an example um because it's not part of our methodology. But what do they already buy or who else has our ideal customer profile, right, that we can use in it and leverage in this. And then that next piece I did put on here is data and partnerships because there's so much in our pocket of what we're doing that other people want this customer. So a very very stupid and simple example is like Medicare for example like um people use that uh as monetization methods where it's oh we have all this data and there's always rules around like you know what you can sell for data or what you can make intros on or what you're not actually like what you can or can't do. Um I'm not going to touch on that because that's not our game. Uh and right now we just play this game uh this right here. So into the next phases we're going to see what we can do in regards to that and data and all those pieces. So hopefully this was helpful. Um today's kind of shot out of a Canon one. I can do a Q&A tomorrow. So, if you guys want to submit a Q&A, that is going to be this right here. Q&A, uh, submit to the request box, uh, I'll make an expost about this as well. If you go to the doc right here, you'll see all of the past videos. You can break down by tech, ops, marketing, sales, all the things. Info coaching, this one right here is a survey that I'm doing to try and get gather just a bunch of data and see what people in the info coaching space, what they're doing for offers, what they're doing for pricing, how big their teams are, how they're kind of like leaning. There's an info like if you want to fill out your contact info on the end if you want me to contact you. Maybe I can help. I'm not char I'm not like doing anything for cash or whatever. So, just FYI, just using it to collect data. I maybe will eventually, but like not really in the cards right now and I won't sell anything. Um, and then Rolodex. This is all my people that I directly have worked with um or have known for x amount of time and have actually really good results. So, if you guys want anything like sales agencies or CRM or you know, W, you know, financing, stuff like that, I have some pretty cool deals with a lot of these guys. Um, but don't feel I mean, you can just find all these direct on your own. You don't have to do this and I just have some good ones. So, yeah, that's where we're at. Sorry for the shot of a can video today. People are yelling and screaming out here and being rowdy. And, uh, I got to go. So, I appreciate you guys. Uh, hopefully you did get some value from this. Hopefully, it helped you think a little bit. Uh, we were literally talking about this at dinner last night. It was my fault. So, my bad there to everybody who's trying to have a fun bachelor party and I'm trying to talk about monetization methods. So, classic. But, I'll talk to you guys soon. Um and yeah.

# you should NOT have a SALES team... here's why | EP106
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcU8k3HEldo

In today's video, we're going to be talking about why you should not have a sales team inside your info coaching business, which is an extremely hypocritical take because we have over 50 W2 employees inside of our sales team across managers, operations, admin, closers, and setters. I'm going to break down why I think most info coaching companies should not have it and how it sits in the org chart. The different type of offer stacks and different sources of traffic that require you to have sales team, the differences, the headcount that equals headache, organic versus paid. our journey throughout this and what I wish we would have done based on two different goal sets. All right, this is going to be extremely helpful for you and I promise this will make sense in the end. All right, last year we did $30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over I think it's actually 78 million now in total cash collected. We'll just say 77. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies opportunities and networking with cool people building cool All right, so let's get into it. Now, I'm saying you should not have a sales team. And when I'm saying you should not have a sales team, first off, you're going to need a sales team if you're selling generally speaking anything over $2,000. Roughly, roughly speaking, I know people who do DMs that send five and 10k payment links, but let's just say that like completely depends on the offer and the warmth of the leads and all that. But let's just use that as an example. When you're selling something over 2,000, you need to go to high ticket. Okay? You're selling something under 2,000, you can use direct toart. Now, most businesses, there's finance departments, there's all this other stuff, but we're going to use these three core departments. You're going to have marketing that's bring them in, which could either be your content generation team for organic, can be paid media buyers, creative, all that. You're going to have your sales, which is only when you're going to do high ticket. Okay? So, anything over that 2,00 or ascension even from the 2,00. And then you're going to have fulfillment, so who actually fulfills on the product. Now, within info coaching, there's a big difference between info and coaching. Info, generally speaking, again, is going to be login access. It's going to be the easiest fulfillment humanly possible with maybe some fulfillment that is a group manager, uh, community success manager, someone who moderates there, maybe some coaches that are inside a group coaching capacity. So imagine you have like a Tuesday, Thursday block on the calendar. People show up and there's, you know, 50 people on there or 500 people on there that ask questions and they get them answered in a group setting. Okay, that's generally how your info is going to go. I have other videos breaking down the differences between the other offerings in info coaching. Okay. But if you're doing something that is in the coaching realm, usually fulfillment is then going to be a bit heavier. Most people are going to do it in a group coaching setting or they're not going to even get to a scale where if they do onetoone beyond them or maybe like one or two coaches, it's really that fulfillment heavy. So, first thing on here is this headcount versus headache. Okay. When you scale this up, most people are going to first exist in this organic realm. Okay. So, I'm in all of the groups, all the info coaching groups. Some there's other ones without me. I understand. Like there's a lot of paid and a lot of free ones that I'm in where most people are doing this and doing a couple hundred grand a month upwards of like high hundreds a month. Uh William Brown who's on here example like he's at five or six hundred grand a month in profit and like you know it's 80 something percent margin. So he's you know basically at that in revenue or cash collected. Um and what their main funnel is is organic. So he has content that's occurring over here. So his editor, his thumbnail person is whatever uh scripting all that that exists in this marketing department which is extremely extremely light in terms of headcount. He creates this organic and then they go to high ticket. Okay? So then they have to go through a sales team and then the fulfillment is him and like two other people. So it's like two people over here and like two people over here or just like one person over here. Okay? Now where I'm saying this gets crazy and gets like all out of whack is the amount of volume that comes in is how big your sales team needs to get in terms of actual headcount. So when you get scaled up and this is our exact example right here. You're gonna have closers as your like core number one thing you're going to start hiring for because you need someone who can close the 5Ks, 10Ks, 25K packages after you don't want to do it anymore. Okay? So, you're gonna have closers. Stuff is going to start slipping through the cracks and you also want quality with the closer so they're not just getting every single lead. So, you're going to start introducing setters. Different people have different things, but let's just say one to one. Some people do two to one on setters. It can get all over the board depending on your lead quality and your flow and all that stuff. So those once you get up to a certain point of how big your closer and setter teams are, you need setter managers and closer managers. Initially, you may just have like player coaches. But again, if you don't have a manager, you are the manager. Okay? So like you are having them report to you. Even if you have 10 closers and you don't have any management, any setters, the closers are coming to you. They're reporting to you. You are the one communicating. So where I'm saying this gets crazy is this sales division. How can I do this to make this just look like it becomes this big big headcount portion when the fulfillment is so light and the marketing is so light. So you end up essentially running a sales team. Okay? And like if your goal this all comes down to your goal, okay? And we're going to get into that and like why I'm I I want to have 50 plus. I want to have 100 W2 sales reps, closers, um setters, closers, that whole department. But like why I don't think most people should do it is because most people are running info coaching businesses for the cash flow. Most people are running them as like lifestyle freedom businesses. And the second you start to do this, you are either managing them or your cost stack starts to add ad add and you're still managing then the manager and that whole department you need quality that it just becomes like this crazy headache. Um and your fulfillment can stay light depending on what kind of fulfillment you have or what um offerings if it's info versus coaching and your marketing can stay pretty lean and tight too. So like really this is what starts to grow and it just gets like becomes the biggest headache. So at scale you're going to have closer setter setter manager over all these. You're even going to have a setter manager. Then they're going to raise in player coaches um that are inside the department. So you're going to have like three tranches essentially a closer manager. You may even at scale have a chief of sales that overlooks a closer manager and a setter manager and then no player coaches. Like there's all these different ways to look at it. And then at certain scale you're also going to have someone who does sales ops that find that goes through the CRM that makes sure that the closers aren't missing things. um that make sure that the data is correct in the end of day reports that the da you know um the presentations on the daily sales huddle are all updated with the most up-to-date cash collected numbers you're going to have VAS in there that are doing things around the calendar like it becomes such a massive headache because this massive team size that's needed for the amount of lead flow okay now not to say this is like a problem not to say it's a bad thing it's just like dream build your dream business and understand this going into this before okay so you are not a Oh, marketing versus sales. These kind of all play into each other. I kind of want to like show all these, but like going through these different funnels, you generally speaking when you're doing this are more of a marketer, more of fulfillment of the actual product you are selling than the actual salesperson. There are different people. There's the Cole Gordens of the world. Love Cole. I think he freaking crushes it. He is like the exception to this and he teaches people how to be the exception to this. Like his thing crushes, but like most people are not inherently good at this sales function and able to do it or manage the team or actually close themselves or anything. Okay, so let's go through these and then I'll circle back. So, most people are going to start with an organic thing and they sell sell sell direct to cart. So, they're selling something that's under $2,000 and it's just like an info product. Okay, so they're going to sell send them to a landing page. They're going to buy something. They're going to get inside a community and all you have then is whatever your marketing team has needed to get this organic content or just you or a couple like super cheap VAS uh or editors or whatever. They're going to buy something here. You're going to have like 99% margins or whatever the math. And then some people are going to then ascend them to high ticket. Okay. Now, when you ascend them to high ticket, they either need to be have enough warmth that you can just send them a link or they need to talk to a sales rep or you or someone to be sold on the high ticket thing. That's 5K, 10K, 25K. Okay. The other option is going direct from organic using some sort of just like application funnel where they book a call and then they're sold high ticket. Okay. Now, this is extremely warm in person. A lot of the time people call these uh sales reps like cashiers because they are basically sold on what it is. They've been framed on what it is. They come in and they're ready to buy. Okay. So, it's an easy sales process. As soon as you introduce paid, this is where a lot of people are like, "Oh, I'm doing 300 grand a month or 500 grand a month. I'm going to start spending and I'm going to double it. I'm going to go to a million a month." When you introduce paid, all of this stuff can start to crack. There's things that can slip through the cracks and then there's also things that like just simply around like lead warmth, for example. So, you start to run paid to the same page that you're running organic to direct to cart and all of a sudden your conversion rate falls through the floor, right? Because warmth is not there, right? You need better sales copy. You need better there. So you start to beef up things in marketing or whatever. Okay, by the time this is kind of a bad example for this, but you're running them direct to high ticket. So you're running them through a call funnel or whatever, the same one that you're running organic through that was just converting and having 90 or whatever 80% show rates and 40% close rates. You run that same exact funnel to uh cold paid and now all of a sudden you have a 50% show rate and a 20% close rate with the same sales reps, the same funnel, the same everything, just a different lead quality or a different lead source more so traffic source. Okay? So instead of them coming from organic and warm, they're coming from paid and they're cold. So now all of a sudden you need a higher grade sales rep. You need someone who is a better sales rep. Now maybe you need more sales reps because you're trying to double, right? So you need double the amount of sales reps. So you need double the amount of people that are good sales reps. Okay? And maybe none of your original ones are. So now you're restaffing this entire team. As you start to do paid and more volume comes through and because you have no shows that are occurring and because you have people who apply but don't book at the same rate and all your conversions across the whole thing drop, you now need setters or you should have setters because you want to make sure that the quality is showing up for the closers. You want to make sure you're missing what falls through the cracks from someone who applies but doesn't book, someone who knows or cancels, someone who does all these things. So now you just tripled your team size from your initial three closers you had here. You now have six closers and they probably have to be different closers because they have to be better at it. Ideally not, but maybe. And then you also have another six setters, let's just say. So now you're up to a 10 plus team. And now who's managing them? You are. Okay? Unless you're going to have one that's going to rise up. You're going to pick your best sales rep that's the best. That's going to ruin it and everything's going to go to zero. Okay? Exaggeration, but I'm going to give you examples. So generally speaking, marketing versus sales, completely different, right? But if you use like Jeremy Haynes on his video yesterday, I was talking about mark uh backend sales system. So, he has so many things that occur post booking before they get on the phone with the sales rep that make it so it can be as much of a layup as possible. It can be as much of like a the closer is essentially just a cashier as possible. So, that involves a lot of stuff around using proper framing, using stuff that's within like the marketing realm as much as possible right here before it even gets to the sales team. Okay? So, you want to like focus on a ton of that. Who's writing the closer scripts? Who's doing the closer scripts? Because the closer script for this ideally is the same as this one, but it's likely not. But it's likely not once you get to scale. The huddles. Who's running the daily huddle every single day for 30 minutes or an hour, 5 days a week, sometimes seven days a week, depending on your volume and depending on what kind of culture you want to create? Who's doing the oneto ones every single week? Who is looking at all the end of day reports every single week? Who is looking at who is perform? Like you need to then build out a team to manage this. And again, it gets like this for what used to be your light simple business. you now have this big sales organization as the main as 80% of your team in terms of a headcount. Okay, assuming you're running a light business now motions, all these things. So, organic first paid already kind of got into but it's like the layups they're warm warm warm like they're just ready to buy is that you have room to fumble. So, you have much more like wiggle room in this than you do in this. And that's the same here too is like when you're running paid direct to cart like organic direct to cart, a lot of wiggle room. I have a great example of this on ours. I built the ugliest page you've ever seen that has uh that we were running for our low ticket and it literally it was converting at like well above KPI and as soon as we started to scale into it and paid we have so many leads inside of our system and so much of an audience that is like a large audience that's already seen our stuff that as soon as we started spending into it it was basically just showing to all those people. So it's converting, converting, converting. As soon as we kind of like spent into that audience or through that audience, it started going into cold traffic, which is where we wanted to be entirely in the beginning. Even if we were doing exclusions or whatever, it was still happening. It literally the conversion rate like, you know, turned 25% of the initial, like just tanked 75% down. And it was because this there's not as much room for how good the page has to be, how good the copy has to be, how good the offer has to be because these ones were warm. These ones were not. Even though we were paying, it was still targeting all the people that were already in our audience. It was essentially the same thing, like acting as retargeting. One call closes. These a lot of the time will act as one call closes. They're already good. Versus this can be upwards of two, three call closes, a lot of follow-up. So all of a sudden people start slipping through the cracks if you don't have a good sales team. If you're over uh if you're overfeeding them with leads and bookings, then they don't follow up in their pipeline because they're like, "Oh, the next one that'll come through just looking for the layup and burning the rest of the bookings, which now cost you money." that didn't cost you money in the same way for advertising that before it cost you in content. Okay. So, our journey on this and why I think that you should not have a sales team. So, uh and why I when I say that I still think you should sell high ticket and I still think you should have a sales team. I just don't think you should have your own sales team. I don't think you should have a W2 in-house sales team at scale personally or at scale. Yes. But so for us initially way way way back when, so I'm talking like beginning of COVID, we decided to launch this callunnel. Okay. So we had CS reps. We had two people on the team, two other people and then three of us, two co-founders, me who became a co-owner and then two CS and I think one bill one billing I think was the team. So CS reps were like, "Hey, we want to start running a callunnel." We put them on the phones, two of them. They literally were closing like 50% on day because again, we had this whole warm audience where we didn't even have this offering yet. And as soon as we had the offering, they could talk to someone, they had more wiggle room, they could then close them. Okay, we were selling a $500 thing over the phone, which is like the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, but like the economics worked because calls then were like sub $50, which is just like not the case anymore. So after that, me and the other co-founders, the two other co-founders decided to take the calls ourselves. So then we're having competitions. We're having fun. So we have these two and then we have us three. So there's five of us all taking calls at the same time, closing, building, building, building. Then turned into the expert brand face uh co-founder. She moved into the product side of things, building out the product, doing all the uh group coaching. We were selling info at the time. And uh me and Luke, which is one of the the other co-founder, uh began hiring and managing. So we were hiring from the sales community or from the uh customer community, which is like a major life hack by the way. So if you want to do this in-house, uh you can hire from your community because these are people who already are generally speaking the ICP already. So when they're talking to somebody who's a potential client, they're already a client. They spent the money on the thing. And where that kind of can break is if it's like, why are you a sales rep if you know whatever you're selling and you didn't get it? So like in ours, it works. It's fitness. It's like cool, they got the result and they want to make money. if you're trying to do any of this like bisop stuff, it's like why are you a sales rep here instead of you know being the trillionaire person who actually succeeded with the course. So navigate that lightly. But so we essentially built this up and we had 25 probably maybe 30 reps um that we had in house that were or in-house but they were 1099. It was kind of like gunslinging. We're like hey we're just going to give you leads. You could be in our systems but like more or less do what you want. But we were running the huddles we were running the onboarding. I was running tech office hours doing all this kind of stuff. And then we had one that was like this standout standout standout individual and we're like that person is a manager and technically speaking they had sales management experience before they came to us and they were a customer of ours. It was like the stars aligned. So we made them the manager so we didn't have to do the meetings and we could basically be like cool cash flow info coaching business. Life is good. And we let that run for a while. The sales rep ended up making like high three no 400s um for us that year and uh or no I'm sorry not for us like made 400 herself like in commissions uh and management fee. like crushed it and we had other sales reps that were crushing it. Like the whole thing was good to go. And at this time, this is a very important part of this. At that time, we were trying to just be an info coaching cash flow machine. And it was actually just info. We didn't even have coaching. We had group coaching inside the info product, but we were selling a one-time lifetime access um to an info product essentially. Okay. Never do this. Never have your top manager or your top rep become your manager. Everyone says to do it or says not to do it and you should not do it, but sometimes you just have to do things on your own to learn that you should not do them. Okay. Um and yeah, it exploded. There's a huge cultural issue. There was like a very different culture styles and personality and someone who's a top rep generally speaking is not a great manager. It takes different skill set. It takes different things around being able to manage these oneto ones and emotions and culture and like these different and management is just different than being a savage closer. Okay. So, we messed that up. lost like half the team in the process of it. We had to get rid of a bunch of people because they essentially were in this pocket and then we had to get rid of the manager because we just had to get rid of the manager and it was like this whole thing and then we had to rebuild. Rebuilt the team, tried to do a bunch of wonky stuff, but then we started to do the 1099 management thing. Now, at this time, nobody was doing 1099 1099 management really. That was like an agency as a service or like where they handled everything. So, there were different people doing 1099 management where it was just that. So they would come in, they would do some one-to- ones with your team and they would lead your uh sales huddles. They would do whatever and they would take a percentage essentially as like an override or a fee based on the cash collected, but they were your 1099 employ or your 1099 sales reps internal or W2 or whatever you had uh internal and they were just 1099 managing. Okay. Tried this for a minute and it just like wasn't a fit for us like the culture of how kind of sand was. So we tried it again with someone else. We're like, "Oh, it's culture/performance." and we did this and then these guys literally were like, "Yeah, you guys are too big for this and you are like you need an internal manager for like what you're trying to accomplish with this company." And at this time, we moved from info to coaching. So, we started selling one-to-one coaching, which was six times the price. Okay? So, completely different offer. So, you have sales reps that are selling something that's $1,500 or $1,000 or whatever over the phone. And now they're going to be selling something at $6,000 or or at the time, I think it was $6,500 um over the phone. That was onetoone coaching, complete misalignment. These guys were like, "You need to find someone internal." And they referred us out to this guy, which we was uh was a top pod leader. So essentially, generally speaking, you have a sales manager, you have pod leaders uh that sometimes um close as well. Um so they're like hybrids. They're like player coaches, and then you have their closers. So this pod leader was the top pod within the entire organization, and he was looking for like a step up in his role, and it wasn't really going to happen inside that organization. So he came over to us to be the sales manager. Okay. So came in there, went from 1 million a month to 3 million a month. Absolutely crushing. Cool. All of that to say then it dripped and does whatever it does and it goes up and down and marketing had issues and like I have other videos where I talk about what happened, how we went back down, and now we're back up and we're back at kind of like essentially where we were um pretty close to for all-time high months right now. So around 3 million a month. So all this now what I wish would have happened if we were just going to keep this as a cash flow business. I now there is such thing as a 1099 like sales agency. This is what I refer out. This is who anybody who asks me. I have two different people. I have one that I like really really trust like see all the results, see everything they do. Very system thinking, very this like rockstar. Okay. And like they only take on people who are doing over 100k a month already and have a 5k plus offer. Like that's the only ones they'll take on. And they will do both of these. So they run all this entire stack is them. So that's the big difference between when we were doing it, there was 1099 management only. You had your own team, you had your own whatever. they would just come in and manage it. Now you can pay like a 20% of your cash collected fee and they will come in and staff all the closers, all the setters. They'll have the management in there. They have their own ops VA. They're inside your CRM. They're updating everything. They manage all of this. All of this for 20%. Now, just for quick math on this, like depending on your stack and 1099 or W2, a lot of people say, "Okay, this is like 10%. This is usually 3 to 5%." This usually has a base plus a fee, so call it two points. This is usually this. This is usually like I don't I mean this is not relative because these are usually like base ones and like these are super low ones. But like just on this math right here, you're already at what is that 10 15 18 and a half points. Okay, I'm using as percents right here. Sorry, that's my math. So I'm saying like closer is going to make 10% of new cash. Uh setter's going to make three. Like let's like roughly say this is what it is. you're already at like 15 to 18% internal and that's with you then having to like manage it or then manage the manager and then have all these people and have them come in and out and staffing and like all of this craziness versus you can now hire one of these 1099 sales agencies that will fully manage it for 20%. Some people do 15 I've heard and some people do like 25 but like I know a guy that does 20% and literally crushes for clients like high high hundreds of thousands. cuz I know he there's clients that are million plot like crushes for them. All they do is take their rip and then all you have to do is never think about this in the same way. You still have to like obviously be attuned to it and whatever, but it's like this in your brain. Same way that if you have a marketing agency that actually crushes, it's like this in your brain. And yes, you're providing them with stuff and like seeing stats, but like it's like this and all you're worrying about is over here. Okay, massive oversimpl uh simplification of this, but like that's the idea behind what I'm trying to get across here. So, you shouldn't have a sales team. You should have a sales team. You should have a sales team for high ticket. You should do this portion. You should clean house on that. I love high ticket, but I don't think that you should have an in-house team unless you're doing what we're trying to do, which is we are trying to exit velocity info coaching, which is like I can't wait to watch this video in like three years and look back and be like, I was either so stupid, which I potentially maybe, or thank you. I can't believe we actually decided to lean into this and it worked. Because we're trying to build equity value. We're trying to build an internal train team. We're trying to be legal. We're trying to do all the things. So, we have a W2 internal team. We have internal managers. We have internal ops. We have all that kind of stuff, which we bite because when things get out of hand and comp plans overlap and whatever and you mess stuff up or whatever, this can be higher. Actually, when you have W2, it's 20% higher in fees right there. Then, so if you're paying someone 10K on 1099, it's call it 12K or PL depending. It can be 12K, it can be even higher um on what you're paying when you it's W2, true cash out of the business. So like I'm kind of trying to like play a different game. Um, but all I talk to is these info coaching and I'm like, "Guys, why are you worrying about having this ma like doing this and managing this yourself when net net the biggest swing difference you're going to have is like five points if you run this yourself and way less headaches like no headcount internal. Unless you are the sales pro and you can do it better and you can manage the cost and you can like get better efficiencies and you think that you and like you can do it like power to you because you can probably do this for 10 12 points and manage it yourself and do all that." like it will be tighter and you will make more margin. Yes. But just for the headaches of it alone, I think that this is like the total play. So, um yeah, that's kind of the gist of this entire video. So, we're doing it internal internal manager. I would have zoomed this up and not even tried these because this was painful for us. I also would have not done this. I would have gone from here to having a manager that we hired externally um that was from the space and we like did not have the understanding or wherewithal of that. And that was probably 2022, 2023 probably um on when this still was all happening. And then by 24 we had full internal sales manager. That's when we did 30 million. That's this year right here. And yeah, so like these years right here. So this is what 28 29 20 21 22 23. Yeah. So 22 23. This is when we were like fumbling around trying to figure this out. had the internal manager um I'm sorry, the the sales rep that became the leader and then tried the 1099 thing and then by like right here we got the internal sales manager and then rolling into this year. So like we had big months coming out of the end of the year and then hit it hard and then scaled into with an internal sales manager. So like I just wish we would have moved this over here. Not to say I would have had the same chart, but like learnings would have gotten me there. So we're trying to do this. We're trying to build this equity value. I think that you should not. So, end of the video, but this right here, this link, uh, you have to use the www, but I'm doing like a survey because I'm trying to understand who all follows me and like what the businesses are, what the offer stacks are. Like, you don't have to put your contact info if you don't want to. It's at the very end, but it's like what are your cash collected? Where do you sit on the Here, actually, I'll just show you it. Do you like my forest? Um, so it's like what niche are you in? It's what are the main offers? Like, what is how is it structured? It's cash collected. It's all that kind of stuff. what's your team look like? And I'm just trying to gather data and like if there's somewhere I can help, I would like to help. Um, if you go to here, www with a doc, this will show you all the videos. I'm on day like 106 or something in a row of making these videos. Uh, and I'm not stopping yet. So, I have a plan to go to like two to three week, but right now not. And then the Rolodex, I just rolled this out today. Today's June 25th, but people were asking me, they constantly are in my DMs asking this, so I decided to make this. These are essentially just people that I trust and either have worked with or like have already referred people to and they get crazy results. So like here are some of the softwares like 100%. So like you can go to these links right here and um I also have direct connects with people who like full set up all your accounts and do everything. These guys crush for external financing like they have split it and some of these other ones. Um and I can get you in direct contact and we have some different fee structures and stuff. Um processing lead cool thing for income qualification on leads. um crazy. You can feed back the pixel only like the top quality of not just based on what someone apply uh fills out an application but what their actual like income uh their access to capital all that high ad tracking best out of the box I use different things I use this and other things um I have other videos about that we still use click funnels to this day and then whatever all these things so I have marketing vendors I have guys that are like just killer media buyers that are for smaller people and then I have guys that are full agencies um both are the same you know similar cost stack on this but like crush um I have some guys that do offer I actually have one specific that does like different offers that either teaches beginners if you're a beginner or does full big builds and a lot of low ticket stuff uh offer creation for existing businesses that have something but need low ticket. I have this really cool ad spend credit card thing that kicks kicks back anywhere from like 5 to 10% on ad spend which is crazy. Some of these and the one I'm talking about today is this the sales full service agency. Um, so yeah, if you want contact info to this, I don't want to put all their info because I don't I don't I only want to refer over people that I think would actually like one that's in their ICP. So like example, the guy that I mainly like uh does over 100k a month people only. Um, and yeah, so if you fit that, then like yeah, just message me on Instagram. That's where I do most of my communication X um DMs, but it's harder to get through because I have so many. Um, Instagram's a little bit lighter. So yeah, if you do it there, then if you're a good fit, give me some context. Like I said here, DM with context and I can make an intro if it actually works or if it makes sense for you, if this model makes sense. Also, again, super hypocrite. We've run this entire thing in house this entire time. I'm just saying I think like hindsight 2020 looking back and especially if we were our goal was to just be like this cash flow biz. I would 100% do this. 100%. So hopefully that was helpful. A little bit longer. A lot of narration, but also I buzzed my head just foring sport. So that was fun today. But appreciate you guys and uh I will talk to you soon.

# Scaling to $1M/Month Isn’t Hard (If You Do This) | EP105
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_OnUvaWUd8

What's up everybody? Today we've got a good one. You guys all know Jeremy. You know him. You watch his content if you watch my content. So Jeremy, kick it off. I think we're on day 104 in a row of doing these every single day. So congratulations. A little different than your content. You got the bangers. I've just got like these little micros every day. Dude, I do twice a week, you know? I I stick to that schedule religiously, but I uh I don't go beyond that. I don't know how you do it every day, man. Yeah. No, I got to move to the two. I got to move. if I was going to go 100 days in a row and I just couldn't stop. So now I got you. But cool. So who are you? What's your I mean dude, the quick reference actually I literally I got to think of how long ago this was like whenever Megalodon like the OG course the OG Kajjabi platform like when you were adding stuff to the catalog. I bought like the first first thing like way back. Yeah. Way back when before it was even like full 80s. I had your Yeah. Yeah. DMM. I had like uh the contracts from there like I had like little stuff there. or some of my first stuff was random like website builds or some little things like that um on click and it was using your stuff. So like full circle that was that was before you did everything with warrior babe and all that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Way before way before. Yeah. I tell people all the time I think a lot of people who sell information you know constantly propagate this as a belief system. But buying info is one of the fastest ways to progress. I mean dude look at your outcomes. You know, although to be fair, you're obviously a rare outcome in terms of the scale that you've reached and acquired. Like the probability of that is very small. I would if I was watching this, I wouldn't have the expectation I'd hit your level, but what I would think to myself is if I could do a fraction of that. And I I remember the video somebody had sent it to me. They were like, "Hey, this Ryan guy just shouted you out. He said he bought one of your courses and he talked highly of it." And I wa I watched it to try to figure out like, you know, obviously what you had bought and like what you had uh what you had watched. And I was like, "Makes total sense. Almost everybody that I meet is such a rarity where they don't consume info in one way, shape or form. Like there's guys who don't like to read books. There's guys who don't like to listen to podcasts, but like everybody has their own, you know, mechanism for like how they learn. Even if it's just talking to others and paying to get in front of people. It's such a cheap I it's like I do when I was young, I played Grand Theft Auto on uh on PS2 and I had like the little cheat code book. You remember this? Left down, right up, left down, you And uh anyway, long story short, I dude I always I always tell people I'm like mentors are [ __ ] cheat codes for real life. You can pay a dude to teach you how to get a result faster comparatively to having to do it on your own. Like why would you not try to increase your odds? Yeah. By by spending what a measly couple bucks, you know, just just money, you know? Yeah. No, you know, excuse me. I mean, I have that video you're specifically talking to. It's like guru something. It's like I paid all the gurus but I'm not a guru or something like that. And I just go down the list and it is I'm like hundreds of thousands in but like you isolate some of them that have had like the biggest impact for me. And that whole video was then all to say like what you consume YouTube podcast listen audible physically read or jump the line and and you know buy a course but even some of the stuff that you can get in courses that are paid. You can find so much for free on YouTube and like how you choose to learn. But like spec like the uh I bought an ovens course the middle one and like very quickly learned like I didn't want to be a consultant. I didn't want to do that. But I met my business partner of this in that inside the community. He made a post in that group. I reached out to him individually and then I started building pages for him and like doing random ClickFunnel stuff. And then fast forward a little bit and it was a callunnel and ownership and then I became you know a third whatever a partner in this and then we went we were doing like 20 grand a month and then we were doing like 100 and then 500 and then what like and I met him in that group. So I was like is that more is that worth the five grand or whatever I paid to get in the course? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah it is. That's I was with Ty I was with Tai Lopez on his farm just the uh just sometime in this month. I don't remember what specific Instagram stories crack me up, dude. You are everywhere. Yeah, you like them. Yeah, dude. I I I love I love posting on stories, you know. It's like one of the rare places where I like actually post what's going on, you know? But yeah, I was out there uh we're we're we're teeing up a challenge funnel that we're launching and I I'm going airize business out there for like how much he's going to spend on it, but we're going pretty big. And long story short, uh, you know, to your point, like I'd never bought a Sam Evans course, but I remember way back in the day when I was first getting on game to Tai, I remember him and Sam did that huge affiliate deal like like Tai was like I honestly don't think Sam Ovens would exist if it wasn't for Tai Lopez, dog. Like straight up, I confidently say that on whatever [ __ ] public mechanism. I bet Sam would agree. You know, that that level of affiliate relationship that those two had was [ __ ] insane, dude. And then and then I thought that was big. And then Tai had gone on to have 400,000 plus students inside of that SMMA program he came out with. And again, like the scale was just that that's what I think most people really lack, you know? I feel like they really lack examples of significance and like serious [ __ ] scale, you know? like a guy like you officially putting out your business and like talking about things and sharing lessons when you've done what you've accomplished too which is which is not to make you feel little by the way a fraction of what these big dogs have accomplished in comparison like I'm sure you yourself can like you look up all the time and that that in turn like that feeling of they got to think big and feel small you know I think that's one of the best strategies in in life period in order to make the things that are like big for most people just like a [ __ ] stepping stone on the path to some serious [ __ ] money, you know? Yeah. And no, and I like your whole thing around like million-dollar months. Like I watch every single video you drop. Like I think I get such little nuggets. We drop them to team obviously in the marketing related, but like a lot of the stuff you get once it starts to kind of cross over into sales. Like I kind of hang out on this portion like I talk about the funnels and whatever, but I don't do the copy. I don't do we don't do I don't do the media buying in there, but oh this on show rates over here and then I focus all on this side. But yeah, the million-dollar month thing is like almost depending on how you look at it, like the stepping stone zone to like you say things in there that are like, "Oh, so and so got, you know, position to exit or so and so is doing 5 million a month now or so and so." And like I only know a couple guys that are doing, you have the massive guys. You have the the the Tony Robbins, you have the, you know, other people that do like large scale info coaching, but I personally only know two different people that do over 10 million a month in info coaching. And like I listen to your videos, 10 million a month is serious. Oh, that's that's a serious level, you know, like to to your point like I know I know a handful that do more than 10 10 mil a month specifically in info. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a that's a that's a level right there. I mean to be clear on the coaching side to be fair and there is a bit of an ecom component but it's like post. So if you're doing 10 mil a month like you've reached a level of scale that's that's like true significance and like you but those guys still think huge you know like a good example of that is Tai. Like I think it's so funny how much people talk [ __ ] about Tai. I love Tai. Tai's one of the best [ __ ] examples like ever in terms of mentors. And just to be fair, it's like I learned a little differently from him because we have a client relationship with them. But yeah, I mean again it's like those guys still don't just stop by any means. Like they think in even greater significance scale in comparison to the level that we all think they're at. And they don't view themselves as huge. They they they know the position they're at. Of course, like they're not naive, but like strategically again they still think so much bigger than they actually are. Even me talking about million-dollar months, I'm I'm very, you know, realistic about the fact that there's such a small quantity of people that hit those numbers. And I constantly put out, you know, expectations about that, like the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that.1% of people ever hit $10 million a year. But the same government entity, the good old United States government, they also openly talk about a small business is classified as anything under $40 million a year. So like people think in significance a million dollars a month. yet. That's [ __ ] 12 mil a year, dude. You you you still have a significant amount of revenue to go before you're even considered a mid-tier business. You know what I mean? It's like, think about that. And and they put out these benchmarks for people. It's just such a shame, you know, to see the like crippling mental position that most people put themselves in where the the the size of their goal and what they view as big more than anything is 100,000% relevant to what they end up achieving, you know, and and I mean, my time with my very first, well, it wasn't my very first buzz, actually, my second marketing job I ever had, well-known sales trainer now in the real estate space, he he taught me this concept of thinking big when I was very young when I got recruited to work with the guy. I was 19 at the time and it just conditioned into me from a young age like dude you got to go big. There's so like have you ever openly talked about how much more you get to create and in what speed you get to create it due to the level of revenue that you've produced? Like do you ever openly talk about that kind of stuff? I mean a little. Yeah. I mean I I talk about anything. So like there's nothing that's like held back necessarily. Like I don't drop the I say rough numbers for profit numbers. I say rough stuff for that because I have partners and like I don't think it's fair for they didn't sign up to be doxed on here. So, I have some of that stuff and I also get into the realistic of like, hey guys, understand that this is some giant vanity number and it breaks down into all these things until you hit this, then how you live, then your tax zones, like your whole thing. It's like, you know, we're not all taking home 70 whatever, 77 million in cash. Like, it's not that. Um, but yeah, we definitely I don't know how much I've highlighted it, but today is a perfect example of that. Like, we're getting on we're like, oh, this and this and this and we have like a seuite that then puts it through their teams and like for things to get done. It does. There is a bit of a slowing kind of sometimes with like the corporate structure a little like versus we could rip some out in a weekend back in the day. But the leverage and impact is massive like you said massive. Yeah. Like like to to your point though even just the scale of impact you get to make with the amount of revenue that you have is so extreme. Like I have I have a client this guy does a little over five mil a month. His test budgets are 100red grand. Yeah. And again like the significance of test data that you receive at 100 grand is obviously huge. It's like I know guys that are like the smallest level students that I've helped that spend like a hund they have they have struggles sometimes spend like a hundred bucks a day or like 200 bucks a day and I always tell people I'm like you just get to time travel you know that's all that's all additional money does it like it like compresses the time frame in which you get to operate and act and and more importantly like it creates that level of impact that becomes normalized at the level you're at but more importantly like becomes just again significant like in in terms of what you get to do and what you get to produce and how many people you get to help and like dude Dude, just just even on your on your main site, like you have 20,000 plus customers that you've helped. How many people do you think you've helped for free that have been subsidized by Oh my god. I mean, here's the quick math for you. 1% one and a half points uh buy of our leads. Yeah, dude. That's exactly right. Yeah. I'm not trying to hijack your thing here just by talking about 20,000 No, we can talk about anything. I'm talking about thinking big all day. I [ __ ] love 20,000 PMO coaching like actual buyers. But now like with a low ticket for example like we probably sold 5,000 of these low tickets in the last you know while testing while messing around. Like a drop sell or is it more like a low ticket to high ticket straight low ticket funnel. So we haven't been able to crack it for like scaled cold acquisition like it breaks when it gets to like like 100 75 100 units a day. It's almost we have so much so many people already in the CRM from five six years of this that it almost is like through the campaigns acting as a retargeting even though if you you can exclude and you can whatever we kind of just run it how it is but it almost like picks people up that were a year ago or six months ago that went through another funnel that exists in the ecosystem somewhere. So it almost it's not like super super cold friendly to where we can scale it heavy but it does thousands of dollars a day and it has a very cold yet? Yeah, it isn't cold. It's in cold but then like it auto it just grabs like you look at high- res for example like how many new leads versus actually how many like actual leads it's like you know 50% call it um we've done the exclusions we've kind of tested out there we've changed the entire framing of the page to make it so it's cold friendly instead of what the existing one was kind of like shorter simpler and actually converted better because it was really acting as retargeting um but did the ascension rate on it so for us it's a low ticket ascension funnel it's sales page with a name email to go to checkout they go through checkout and then the thank you page there's an order bump on there now for some AOV love. Um, but no upsells. The thank you page is like, "Congratulations, you've been upgraded XYZ. Now book your quick start call. Book your quick start call." And we get like 75% take rate on that. They get on with a setter. 15 minute zoom call with a setter. Then they go from setter to closer. It has the highest show rate, the highest close rates. And the ascension rate is, let's just say, five plus right now. Like cooks. What's the What's the AOV on what you ascend them to? It's sub 100 and it's 7 to 10K. Yeah. Sick, dude. I [ __ ] love low ticket to high ticket ascension. Do you remember the peri I don't know if you went through the same like slump. I saw it collectively across the board like not only just in clients we help but just it seemed like damn near everybody. There was that there was that duration of time from like arguably like 2014 to probably probably late stage like 2018 where you you had like the automated webinar live webinars, challenge funnels, events, low ticket to high ticket ascension. Like these things were just [ __ ] cranking. And then you had that like co era where everything seemed to change. like it seemed and I liked it a lot. It seemed to change to like call funnels and we had this strategy we called the hydro. It was like this conditional logic lead form strategy like the ones built into the platform itself feed them to really hungry setter teams and like people were just upselling like crazy through the for through the more like direct funnels. Now we we we were convinced that it was Have you ever read the book pendulum? You ever heard of that? Yeah, dude. One of my favorite books. I don't think it applies when you read it to marketing but like you take the concept you apply it to marketing. And I think that's what happened. I think for a duration of time, you know, the types of people that that preferred to buy that way through those types of funnels, that was like where the pendulum was at its greatest. And then you saw this like slow migration to these extremely direct funnels like the call funnels, the lead forms, and ju just things that you know didn't make you watch like hours of content or like make you buy something cheap before you got to buy the more costly thing. And dude, again, I think the pendulum has swung back into the counter side again. And we're seeing those funnels crush right now, dude. Like crush. We have a guy, we just got introed to him. I won't say who it is so I could say the numbers, but this guy wants to spend $5 million on a challenge funnel. Just to put into perspective like the level of risk that the absolute [ __ ] big dogs are taking on, you know, these types of funnels again. And I think a big part of what helped the pendulum swing besides just every funnel was like direct oriented. We we had uh all that short form really take off at the same time. So like people for a long time were consuming these really like direct and tiny pieces of content and they were thinking kind of like executive summaries of books. You know, you ever read executive summaries instead of the actual book? It's like I I sometimes find myself doing that and then I think to myself, I'm like, I probably missed so much [ __ ] that this author like learned and put the work into expressing in like, you know, the expanded versions of it. And anyway, long story short, I think that people started to realize that and I think that's a big part of what made the pendulum swing back to these like longer format funnels working again. But man, I love I think sales people also love these types of funnels so much because you can liquidate a lot of the ad spend on the front end. Like we're going into a lot of these challenges as an example profitable. We're not really doing paid webinars. We're still doing free webinars. We're not really liquidating anything on those, but still the profitability is insane on on like we're like minimum like five to one on webinars when we like [ __ ] up, you know. Uh the moral of the story is is like the low ticket to high ticket specifically though, not to digress too much, is one of my favorite like yet untapped strategies by a majority of people. I I don't think that people recognize that business owners specifically are trying to make [ __ ] buku bucks. I don't think they recognize the true power of a a really dialedin setter team that can and and more importantly a dialed in low ticket product because like that low ticket thing that you're talking about that has a really good ascension rate I bet you're following every best practice that there is in regards to a fast result something that people can immediately like consume and feel like they benefited from the the the downsides of low ticket is when you do it wrong. Like if you have a product that has some long drawn out consumption period and it takes a long time to to get whatever the result is that's promised in it and and even crazier it's not even a result that might align to the higher ticket thing that you want to up you know it's like there's there's there's rules of the game simply put you know what I mean I know you know but but anyway I love low ticket so much but only in the context of obviously is sending people to high ticket I'm I am a high ticket junkie I am a I am a huge advocate kit for high ticket anything whether it's a product or service. I had a buddy who started a hyperbaric chamber company. He hit a mill a month in four months of start but it's like his average order value is like 50 60 grand for a hyperbaric chamber. You know his customer base is already super [ __ ] rich. And again it's like people just discount how much better it is to optimize a business around high ticket and in my preference selling to rich people too. you know, you you do it a little differently, I would assume. I assume that you're not just as rich. I mean, like our our target demo is that. So, like just by nature, like you look at the TAM, you look at, you know, you were talking about stats earlier. You pull it up like we have the highest, you know, spendable cash of any market, you know, women 40 to 60 like as an average, right? Then of course you have your pockets within there like a business owner or this or that. There's other people that do this specifically for people who do um who make X income and all that. You just said so many good things there. like I'm trying to like but the fir the first one that you were talking about I watched your video which was like which which funnel type right now like ranked and all that. Um so tier list yeah the tier yeah yeah the tier list. Uh we have only ran VSSL opt. I love dude that's my favorite funnel. You know I got to keep it real like the only reason that most we ever have to run any other type of funnel is because of salespeople. Like that's really it. It's it's so easy to get financially qualified people to book calls, but without the right back-end selling systems enabled that help move a lead that just booked a call further along in the sales process, you're just going to get whiny sales people that say the leads most most sales teams are really really unarticulate. Like they fail to give feedback that marketing can actually use. And we we don't we don't tolerate that. So, like we generally with any sales organization we work with, whether it's in-house or one of these sales agencies that exist, we get really good feedback. And long story short, as a result of that, like I've developed a lot of these things, I call them back-end selling systems. Like these back-end systems are, to be clear, there's four of them in particular that I've developed right now. Number one, confirmation page best practices. We put these things called breakout videos onto the pages and they immediately answer a lot of the questions. And what what we find, simply put, this is really important to understand, right? people move further along in the sales process and prioritize something and and that leads to an action with the right information. When when there's a lack of information, there's a lack of prioritization and a lack of action that occurs. And so, as a result of that thinking, that's helped me with the confirmation page best practices. This other thing we call value dense email sequences, which again, it's just dense amounts of information that help move people along in the sales process. By the time they show up to that call, they have a higher probability to buy in a shorter duration of time. the hammer them campaign which takes an excessive amount of content and just blasts it at these [ __ ] people who take key actions both short and long form and then the final thing is what the sales people can manually do which I generally as as this principle spec here's the best part each one of these things independently can create massive impact on their own okay you just combine them together and and you I call it back-end selling systems these specific things combined like it's so hard to [ __ ] that up with the level of impact you can have on something like a call funnel. And that's an example of like even though the pendulum swung back to these longer format like you know challenge funnels, webinars, low ticket to high ticket, you can still absolutely crush with call funnels, but it's augmented with a lot of content consumption and information density to help people create a priority out of whatever it is that you know you want to sell them on. People show up to a sales call with a lack of information. It's no longer a sales call, it's an education call. And when it's an education call, your sales people will typically say stupid [ __ ] like, "Oh, the leads aren't qualified or the the, you know, these people are cold." And when they compare them to people, especially from organic, that's the number one polarizing bias we get between a team that does really well organically and when they introduce paid ads, they'll typically [ __ ] most about that. Like they'll give that kind of feedback. But what they're actually trying to say is in a way that they aren't like able to articulate is is like, "Hey, these people need far more information to actually be able to make a buying decision." and and people don't consider like the amount of content and over what duration of time the content gets consumed organically. So so you fail to replicate an organic sales process when you fail to get the same amount of information in a substantially shorter duration of time and the information is typically not not consumed the same. You know what I mean? Yeah. So a question on that cuz so we do this right now where our belief around the VSSL opt-in funnel is that because they have the intention and they put the micro commitment they put their name and email they have to wait until X portion of the VSSL until they apply even pops and then they get all the contextual follow-ups but they get two emails a day that push them to the main site and then from there it's like the web of content they can consume as much as possible and if you look on the average like time from lead to close like it varies vastly but exactly what you're saying like the consumption all of our organic exists as middle and bottom. We have like 0.1% that's first click organic for us. Like crazy behavior over there. But then and the reason I say that is then we go to do a DTA which is what we call it. I don't know I think direct to VSSL. Um but the headline VSSL and app button right there you talk about I just embed the app by the way. I don't even do the button. I just embed the app right there. Yeah. So like how are you solving for consumption from cold on that? I mean yeah and we're doing a great point. I see here's the thing. I feel like I don't give a [ __ ] about the front end the front end consumption of the information like you articulated that you do there. I'm all for I want to be really clear and say this the general public specifically and when you're selling to the general public, you you do have to behave a little differently with how you're going to execute these these tactics and strategies. You should absolutely give a [ __ ] about front-end consumption with the general public. But it's also based on I call it the interest spectrum. So, I generally visualize this in like a in like a a bar chart, okay? And I like to say there's about four stages of levels of interest. I think there's curious. I think there's general interest. I think there's highly interested. And then I think there's convicted. And I think above convicted is where deals get done. If you have things in your ads where it's like image ads or like very very surface level video ads that create curiosity but not a higher level of interest beyond that I do believe that you need to obviously increase the amount of consumption on the front end as a result of a failure to like frame the lead from the ad to the page properly. Your page then becomes what has to increase the interest level to get somebody supercharged to come out the other side more probable to buy. So I don't I don't like look at it like it's just one or the other. I look at it like it's an entire system that has to be optimized together. And so due to the power of what I've seen on the backend selling systems specifically, these these backend selling systems have substantially greater consumption comparatively to the front-end consumption. That's what I've seen time and time again. Every time we roll these out, I can come into a business that has like sub, let's call it in the teens or even singledigit play rates on VSSLs where they're still getting a really good cost per call and they see some of the symptoms of people showing up and treating the call like an education call and and people show up with like long sales cycles as a result of treating it like an education call. And you get that type of sales feedback I just described with with all leads are cold or not ready to buy yet. And you know, all we have to do is just implement something as simp like we had a guy the other day that we've had two inner circle members that have seen this level of result. Just as just as an example of recent ones I can think of a 32% lift and a 36% lift in show rate only from taking the breakout videos and putting them onto the confirmation page. Like that was it. That's all they did. They didn't even do the other three yet, you know. And and to be clear, I can't stress this enough. It's it's not about when they consume the information, okay? It's just about the information getting consumed. Yeah. You understand? So I I'll I'll frame it like this from like a literal example from this week. So I pay a fuckload in taxes every month as I'm sure you do too. Every on an annual basis, however you choose to pay them, I have I have a tough time nutting up and paying seven figures in one time. So I pay a monthly instead. Long story short, until I do like the estimated tax thing, you know, and then I then I get chipped with like a little bill at the end or or maybe one of these years I get lucky I get a little money back, you know? As a result of like just constantly [ __ ] talking about taxes, you'd imagine I get targeted by a fuckload of tax strategists and things like that. So anyway, I see this guy's ad and it was so good. The guy the guy explains he's like, "Look, you're not poor anymore. Like you're you're rich, you know? You don't need a a CPA and like a [ __ ] tax attorney. like you need tax strategists and like let me explain what it is. And he starts articulating the differences between, you know, your standard like what you likely used on your business on the way up and all of these like super legal ways for tax reduction strategies that I've like vaguely heard about or and and this guy elaborated it well enough in the video ad where when I went to the page, I was ready to book a call right then and there and talk to the guy and instead, you know what he did? He he [ __ ] delayed the application button. And look, dude, I'm busy and rich, okay? I went to that page. I was ready to go. You could have honestly, you could have picked up the phone and just talked to me right then and there, answered like a handful of questions. There's a really high probability I would have bought. Even if I could have scheduled a call and he would have gotten me even more information in between then and the call. Again, even higher probability I would have bought. But instead, what'd he do? Delayed the [ __ ] button. Okay. You think I You think I stayed until the button showed up? No. Yeah. Get [ __ ] I didn't. I left immediately. I was like, "Oh, no. This like is this an error?" I even gave him the benefit of the doubt. Refresh the page. It wasn't an error. The [ __ ] delayed the button. I was out. Now, ask yourself this, Ryan. Am I a qualified customer in that example? Just ready to buy. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, I don't even know that [ __ ] guy's name. I couldn't remember right now. I remember your video talking about the Dubai one where you were like or hearing about Dude, the Dubai one's a perfect example like that. Now, that was more of an example of the failure of the backend selling systems. like they didn't give me so like they did a they did a good job framing on the front end, right? And that's what most businesses do. They they don't they don't look at the entirety of the process. Like they only look at the front end where they're like, I need a good ad. I need a good VSSL and then I just need reminder emails. Like these people are going to show up on that interest spectrum I talked about, I view it as like a dynamic thing. So like after the actions taken, if no additional information is consumed, I believe the interest level falls from from whatever level they're at to a subsequent level below it. And I believe with the right information and and sometimes to be fair with the wrong information it can go down. With the right information we get to punch that bar up further. And I and I believe it's like a dynamic thing. I don't believe it's static. You know I believe it moves in real time relative to information or a lack of information that's consumed. So moral of the story is yeah with that Dubai one it's the same kind of context. It was okay. I'm again just trying to [ __ ] lower this godforsaken tax bill just over here getting milked the I'm just getting the living [ __ ] milked out of me by the government. How do I get this thing down? And long story short, company says, "Hey, we can offshore your corporation in Dubai. We can like license your IP to the corporation in Dubai. You just put all your profits into this corporation. You you zero out your profits in the United States entity and you set up this offshore entity." And and apparently the only tax you're going to pay is this new tax called a guilty tax which is introduced by the Trump administration. A great name, by the way. Long story short, it was a 9-day window before the call happened. And they got me [ __ ] all information in that full nine days. All they sent was reminder emails. Not even a salesperson reaching out, just touching base. And as you can imagine, like again, interest spectrum falls is a lack of information is is delivered to the lead. By the time that call happened, I have infinite [ __ ] as I'm sure you do too, that you could go do in comparison to a sales call for something that was 9 days ago that you don't even recollect or remember. You You have that experience. And I'm sure a bunch of people watching this have that experience with leads that booked 24 hours ago or 72 hours ago. Now just expand that out over nine [ __ ] days. It's like it's a system, right? You have to have the front end dialed in. And you could do what you described where you can do the button delay, but I think you know when I think the button delay works best when the leads are only curious and you have to increase their interest to at least a general or highly level, a highly interested level. I do not believe that the button delay works otherwise because if I have a highly effective ad and I I get supercharged people who are highly interested to the page in market ready to go, I'm going to lose a tremendous amount of very qualified people. And to be clear, Ryan, I might still have a great cost per call by doing the button delay, but I might I might have significantly greater revenue numbers if I let those people through and I took the same information. That's what most people do. You ever see the silly question in a VSSL out in the wild in somebody's application where they ask the dumbass question, did you consume the entire VSSL before you booked the call? You ever see that [ __ ] Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're testing it on one of the DTAs right now. It's the first question. Get [ __ ] with that. I hate that. I hate that. It's It's like that's representative of the fact that you have no back-end selling system. So, like if you fail to take what is talked about in the VSSL that you're attempting to get people to consume that you believe makes a significant difference to the sales process, why would you not take that same exact information and reiterate it on the back end? Why why be so pretentious in the thought that okay, they watched it in the VSSL, that means they're going to remember it before the [ __ ] call that happens in like 48 hours or 72 hours, right? It's like, why would we not reiterate the things I have like Ryan, great example of this, I'm sure you have this too. people pay you money, you you tell them exactly what they need to do in like one form of a consumable, maybe like a video or an SOP or uh whatever form of like how you got it to them and you'll have the same question you answer like a thousand times over and different consumables and you find yourself talking about it like a very high frequency and to you as the person talking about it a very high frequency, you might interpret that like any regular person would as why the [ __ ] do I have to keep talking about this, you But in reality it's like that there's a different like brain you have to use and deploy when you are dealing with at scale volumes of leads. Like why would you not take the key things that you are tired and bitching about people not knowing by the time they show up to the call and reiterate reiterate it to them in many consumables prior to the call. Why would you not? you know, that's my thesis and that proves out time and time again to have a very high impact in businesses who apply that same thesis. You you know what I mean? And that's the word I'm really trying to get out there and and in in this particular episode that we're on now, you know, there's tons of other [ __ ] that works really well that we could talk about, too. But that specific thing is is like literally right here, right now, one of the number one things I think businesses are completely [ __ ] whiffing on. Yeah. I mean, us included right now. This is our lowest uh month-to- date show rate we've ever had right now. And we you watch one of your videos right in the beginning and and also like we have true seasonality of like oh it's summer and like all these women these 46 year old women book the calls and then kids in on summer breaks and like you see the excuses or whatever the cancellations change like kind of seasonally but this is notoriously now three years in a row like a low month for us. not an excuse but like is so we're like looking at this on how do we do this and now we did 71 million with no setters no confirmations no like call dial teams we are now great offer by the way that's representative of the fact you just got a baller offer that's in demand and you got a nice I mean it's worked for us no doubt but like it was literally one funnel we rammed through it actually you probably could have made like 240 if you would have had that dialed in dude oh my god retention alone we left 40 million on the table like oh my god so but still interesting I watch one of your We sent it over to team. We implemented and it was hilarious. We did we changed up the thank you page. We added in the hammer them. We did the hammer them wrong so it wasn't excluded. Like it was like completely skewed and set up wrong. We got a new CMO that came in that wants to join your mastermind by the way. So we can talk about that offline but that'll probably happen very soon here. We could talk about it right now. Ryan, you're going to [ __ ] me so hard if you join into that. That's what I always tell people, especially people like you. You join into that kind of thing. Think about how easy it is. I We had a guy join in. He had a 36% show rate. It went to 74% in a week and a half. Made $178,000. That guy paid me 60 grand for the year. In a week and a half, I call it the you're [ __ ] me spectrum, right? When you first pay, I'm [ __ ] you. But when you all of a sudden make far more money than what you're going to pay me in a year, you [ __ ] me. I believe deeply in and immediately as fast as I can flipping that spectrum into your favor. And think about this. You know why you did the hammer them strategy wrong? Because you're because you don't have the hammer them SOP. You're just watching it off of videos. And to be fair, on the on the free videos I put on YouTube, I do try to put out tremendous levels of game to help people make money and get a better result. But at the same time, the paid stuff, I'm not one of those [ __ ] that puts out all my great stuff for free. I put out like 10, maybe at most 15% of the real [ __ ] sauce. And even think about it right now, like conceptually what we're talking about, people are sitting here and they're like, "That makes a fuckload of sense. I'm gonna go try that." And they're going to get a result. But at the end of the day, if I showed you a fuckload of examples, if I showed you the specific SOPs, if I showed you the millions of dollars a month that we spend on these strategies and what we already figured out the hard way, that's an exact example we talked about at the very beginning. What a great open loop that we just closed. We got to open a new one. We got to open a new one. Uh the what was the OG the You were saying, what did your show rate do though? What were you saying? Oh, what was the result? Show rate dipped under 50% is global. And like and what I say when I say that is every single booking completely possible to a live call. So you have dupes, you have you have reschedules, you have cancel, you have every possible thing that could possibly happen. You isolate them to buckets and it's like the ones that are confirmed by a setter 68%. You have the ones that come through low ticket 84%. You have like all these different ones and then you have the ones that are like drag the boat down which are the unconfirmed which we now started doing like open up the free spot so they can get double booked if a setter can't confirm with them. So we added in setter dial confirmations. We added in like all we changed all the text sequences. We're still sending green because here's the other thing is we're doing hundreds of calls. Hundreds a day of calls. Third world text messages. Bro, you can't even get them iPhones. You had 71 million. You can't get them iPhones. Dude, the management and the thought behind that like blows my mind. So then we find all these like platforms and we have XYZ platform. Actually I got on with them and talked about it. So like we use Sendblue. We use Sendblue for an automation thing. It doubled the response rate on blue. The cost though on those are insane. Like although to be fair like it is it is technically an ROI positive action. It's like you could just get insane. You get business lines and iPhones for every person in your organization which would arguably be more beneficial. The only downside is you don't get to track it. You know you don't get to throw the data into the CRM. So like the cost though is hundreds of dollars a different in a difference per line per month by using their tools, you know. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean I I'm with you. Then you use one of the Yeah, the blue tools. Exactly. Those are crazy. But we threw in where I'm going with this is we threw in the emails with no context other than let's just email them every two hours on the 2hour. No, you did the sticks a day. No proper no proper filtering. No proper whatever. Yeah. Hey, be careful on that. There's a regulation about that that could get you fined. Yeah. So, don't no don't worry. Don't worry. Within a week of doing it, the amount of people that were like, "Stop emailing me." We like there's a good I I usually start like three a day or four a day until we get a diminishing open rate. So, like we'll kick it all the way up to six a day. But again, it's very important to understand, right? You might have also gotten that level of feedback because the information that you specifically chose to send might not have been the information that actually was like preferential to be consumed. You know, pages were ugly. The content was just content that we threw together to do it. It wasn't like, you know, all your clothes lost wrong good information that they actually want to know. That's that's what makes it like welcomed. You know, six a day sounds [ __ ] audacious to somebody sitting here that doesn't understand the principle behind like what you're sending in the six day. The worst part included it in the SMS. We included in the SMS, too. So, we were SMSing them like three times. That's crazy. I I respect the text messages. You know, the only thing I do via text is I have the I have the sales people manually reach out and I have them listen to this, right? I believe that the setter's responsibility and the saleseople's responsibility outside of what marketing can do. Marketing is kind of like unless unless you really spend the time to take application data that you receive and create a bunch of little like spiderwebed contextual communication sequences relative to the application data you got, which is smart. And arguably when you have the initial automation sequences created for emails and texts, you should go back and adapt them to be contextual eventually because that creates a huge difference of response and like you know consumption of the data. But the sales people's job prior to the call when you don't have a lazy organization is to tailor information specific to what the lead wants. So, so literally right before this, I had gone and gotten a little apology gift from my fianceé down in the design district. Okay, I'm a very direct individual and sometimes I'm rather abrasive, you know, so I feel bad. So, I buy her gifts, you know, makes me feel better. So, anyway, I was down in the design district, okay? And I went to Laurel Piana and I'd gotten some nice nice baby blue whatever the [ __ ] they call them, the shoes and and this little like picnic basket air balloon looking bag from their new resort collection. Okay. And that specific lady like she does such a phenomenal job. Like I get blasted with like the Laurel Piana just hey we got this new collection kind of emails or like you know the general communication that goes out to literally everybody. But that lady, she knows I don't buy [ __ ] I wear this same outfit every day. I have 70 of this exact t-shirt and 70 of this exact pair of shorts. Okay, this is my daily outfit. The only thing I rotate is a watch and sometimes my shoes. Okay. And long story short, she knows I'm not buying [ __ ] So, if she ever sends me men's stuff, which again, she never does cuz she knows I never buy [ __ ] It's like I'm not going to be responsive to it. But I'm going to [ __ ] look what she does. And she sends me very specific things in the colors that she knows I'm more probable to buy and specific styles of things they sell that I've historically purchased or shown interest in that are specifically gifted to my fiance. And as a result of that, I have a dramatically higher response rate. I spend more money at that specific location in the design district compared to all the other stores because nobody at Chanel does that for her. Nobody at all the other little [ __ ] stores do that for her. The only person that takes time to do that is this single woman at Laurel Piana. And my point is is like businesses, right? If they have their salespeople actually reflect on the application data that they receive, which is the first set of real communication you get on a lead. And on top of that, you obviously have the person's info. Like go look them up. You know how much you can learn about somebody just from looking at their Instagram profile or whatever other public social media channels they have? Google the person's name. Google the person. We have we have one organization. They they treat they they teach people with a 90 plus% success rate how to cut out alcohol. Okay? They look people up on Google because they deal with executives and rich people. And they found just the other day there was this guy who came through who was a surgeon out in Houston who wanted to cut out alcohol. The salesperson had three examples they were able to pull from documented testimonials of people who were doctors and coincidentally another surgeon and that specifically imagine just getting blasted with one of those giant [ __ ] testimonial pages, right? It's like nobody gives a [ __ ] about that. The only time they generally care about testimonials is trying to look at the bad ones to see how [ __ ] they could get if they work with you. It's like in comparison, you know which ones they do care about that are the good ones? The ones that are people similar to them. That guy read those testimonials. He moved his call time up by a full 36-ish hours and bought on that call. They normally have a two call close process that takes about a 10day window for their average deal cycle to close. It's like all you got to do is just those little contextual opportunities to kind of like tailor and personalize information. That's the salesperson's job prior to a call because in almost all instances, marketing doesn't have the willingness to take all that same data and create like, you know, massive amount of individual contextual communications. It'd be it'd be rather tough. AI AI might get us there soon enough, but for right now, it's like manual labor, you know. So, we use that right now. So, we built one in house that'll take their application info, but we only use it for app no books, which I know you're going to say is stupid because I watch your stuff and you're like, you should have 100% app to booking ratio because you embed them in one. Well, no, I mean to be fair, like even when you integrate the type form and calendarly combo, you'll still get a drop off, but it's not going to be like 50% like if you separate the two pages out, you know? So, I mean, huge amount of revenue, right? % we separate them out but so like let's you know you get a 60% drop no 40% drop 60% through Jesus crazy you to tolerate that yeah we have we have the app to booking and the app to booking flow will messages from an AI and it reads their application completely and then contextualizes the respon like it's like hey blah blah I see you're been struggling with this and whatever contextual and then we took all of the website resources which is hundreds of videos podcast whatever put them in a database it can look up on and find things and then link them to be like, "Have you seen this video that we put out?" And it goes to the website, which is like a content web. So, like, that's a great example of money right there. That's exactly what I'm talking about. You know, I [ __ ] love that you did that. That's awesome. And even better for you that you have a competitive advantage by not having that be a public tool for others to be able to take advantage of. Sweet. That's such a good moat tactic right there. [ __ ] yeah. Yeah, it's a good one for those. But no, what you keep saying and what I have been like feeling more and more and I think and I've been saying it more publicly but the info coaching land the guys who don't want to sell which is 99.99% of info coaching with if they can even sell is this sales team function it is by far usually the biggest headache the biggest headcount the biggest like all the things of these info coaching businesses because usually it's leaner on fulfillment especially if it's info versus coaching the marketing team if they use agency or if they use whatever they use someone like you like very light. This sales team, it becomes like they're sales companies, especially when it's like all high ticket. True. The management, the what slips through the cracks, the like insanity. Insanity. So, like what do you think about that for and I met Josh uh Josh Troy um and I heard you guys are, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, he like he's a G. I've been talking to a couple people and like one of the only people with the sales agency that like takes this serious and actually has like he just has really high standards. I appreciate people have high standards and he's he's one of the few people I think I know professionally over my entire career that operates at like a really high level with with again just super high standards. So yeah, big shout out to Josh for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, moral of the story is um yeah, I mean, look, there was a there was a strong duration of time, like I'd say like 2020, 2022 where I couldn't even quantify to you right now how much money I lost on sales team performance just absolutely [ __ ] me. Like deal after deal. Like we would have in some instances, without exaggeration, hundreds of like people who said, "I have the money to buy this. Like I have good credit, you know, like I'm ready to go." And then the sales team would just whiff, dude. Just whiff every single time. And again, for a for a good duration of time, to be fair and like point the finger of blame at myself, what I would do is the classic like sales versus marketing stickick, right? I'd be like, "These guys [ __ ] suck." Like replace them and and make them better. Cuz cuz the polarizing difference was we obviously have deals that were doing at the exact same time in a pretty high quantity that are just crushing it with the exact same funnels. sometimes in very similar or if not the same niche, you know, with very similar offer types with like subtle changes of course and you know then you just watch one sales team crush it and make [ __ ] banger amounts of revenue and then you see one team that just can't even close a deal on hundreds of opportunities, you know, and you look at the differences and like I said, initially I would just be like, well, this is I used to call them fat cat closers versus real salespeople, right? And I would vet in our deals, which we still do today to be fair, of of trying to find teams that exclusively have real salespeople. That's another another big reason I like Josh. Generally, his sales organizations have fully staffed like real salespeople and and more importantly, real sales management. Okay. So, these people, you know, time and time again to your point, um, they're like the owner operator and they don't have sales management. And if they do have sales management, their equivalent of like a [ __ ] idiot, you know, like they could be a they could be a whatchamacallit um back in the day when we had kings and queens and they'd be the little fool, the little joker. They could be one of those guys, you know, like that that's the equivalent of their role, you know, like the king talks highly of them, but they're [ __ ] idiot, you know? And long story short, like you know, you come into some of these businesses as somebody who operates at like a significant scale and like, you know, a lot of my leverage in deals is from rev shares that we have and we don't get substantial rev shares in deals that are already cranking a couple mill a month. Generally, it's with the businesses that like couple hundred grand or sometimes more than a mill a month already. So, you know, we come into a situation that's sometimes pretty [ __ ] that we got to fix, but there's like a good offer and a good deal, so it's worth taking on. And simply put, just to reiterate, the biggest impact that we've seen time and time again, instead of blaming the sales team, it's this mindset of, okay, if I was working with a literal pack of monkeys, okay? Like just full-blown I needed cashiers at a grocery store, how easy it is to close these deals. What would the differences be in how I would operate comparatively to what I'm choosing to do now in order to create a better result? You know, the quality of questions you ask dictates the quality of the life you live. And that question unlocked a lot of the thinking I've shared today on this specific episode we're talking on right now. The biggest changes as I mentioned backend selling system tactics, the hammer them strategy, a lot of my content ad strategies solve these types of problems. Having clients film very specific videos that you know as a as a list of like high impact videos. There's some very particular ones. I'll I'll share one with you that I share on my YouTube channel all the time. So tell me this, Ryan. Would you ever openly go into your payment processor and share your dispute rate with potential customers? Would you make a video like that? I could. Yeah. But what level of trust do you think it would immediately provide if you chose to do something like that? Yeah, a lot. Remember, a customer is looking for how [ __ ] they could get by doing a deal with you just as much as they're looking at, well, how good could things go? And in most instances, like you're cherrypicked testimonials that almost all businesses, to be fair, I imagine you're likely highly FTC compliant at this point and not probable to be cherrypicking the best testimonials and not showing true averages. But a lot of businesses that obviously are not following FTC compliance, like that's a common practice that they have and that creates distrust. Comparatively, imagine you do a video and you just straight up log into your payment processor and you just straight up show it. You're just like, "Look, I have a 0.52% dispute rate over the lifetime of my entire entire amount of transactions. Here's the total amount of people that have ever transacted with us. Here's the ones that have disputed. Here's our total refund rate. And by the way, I'm just going to go through a few with you and I'm just going to show you right now. Let's click on them and let's look." So, as an example, when I make that video for mine, no offense to the country of India, every [ __ ] dispute I've ever had is a very low ticket product I tested originating from India from some [ __ ] And then I go on Google and I type in the name of that product and bam, a fuckload of pirated versions of that exact same piece of whatever the [ __ ] was bought and disputed. And I can tie the two together super easily and be like, arguably my actual dispute rate is essentially zero. Yeah. And the only reason I have ever had disputes is cuz these [ __ ] [ __ ] like to pirate my stuff. You know, I was like, long story short, ever since I started charging 5K plus, it's like coincidentally, we don't get anybody that tries to do that kind of stuff. And I go and I show things like, look, here's here's the literal handful of people we've ever refunded and here's the specific stories behind why we've refunded these individuals. And I can't stress it enough like as an example of the level of impact that that type of video would create on the back end of somebody doing something like booking a call and going through the research process or or another great one like dude, I guarantee you at your scale somebody Googles your company name with the word scam or review. I bet there's Reddit threads. I bet there's all kinds of random [ __ ] I bet there's YouTube videos about people just telling you you're a [ __ ] scammer. And the thing is is like at scale especially, the spectrum grows in terms of the quantity of people that are just always like there's people right now that no matter how much value you put out, no matter how impactful the things that we sit here and talk about are that and even though we didn't even charge for anything that we just talked about that can make people money based on what we just discussed, there's still some [ __ ] [ __ ] out there sitting there saying, "Oh, course creators are a scammer." You know, like none of them are valuable. And it's like again that's totally fine because as that industry grows the quantity of people that sit there on that end of the spectrum grow and the quantity of people that are just already sold grow but the biggest part of the market is the middle part that can be swayed by very simple pieces of information. Generally when you do research on something you don't do it deeply and intently until you're actually ready to make a purchase decision. The very first thing you're trying to do, especially when you book a call, is just look for some smoke to see if there might be signal that there's a fire somewhere. Yeah. And sometimes all that looks like, is going on Google, typing in the company name and the word scam, and seeing like one of those little descriptive things underneath a hyperlink. That is we we had one the other day. It was so funny. Company name and the word scam. And it was a Reddit thread that didn't even have anything bad about the company name. But the little text that Google decided to annotate as the description of what was said in the Reddit thread based on the query was the company name. I'm an executive at this company dot dot dot huge scam dot dot dot charge is expensive. And then like I'm like whoa, what's this? You click into it, you search literally the entire Reddit thread and you find a single comment that's like really long that had nothing to do with the actual company to be clear. It was actually a comment talking highly of the company and talking about a competitive company that was a scam that that person was an executive at. And it's like you think the person's going to go and scrub the entire Reddit thread and look for that comment. No, they're going to Google it, see that specific thing, and just be like, "Oh, somebody who's an executive that works at the company called it to scam." They're going to leave. they're just going to be like, I'm not going to show up. So, it's like again, imagine, right? The this the the second video you would make is an example of a breakout video. You help people do their research and due diligence and you lend perspective on what they're going to go and find anyway. And like you go on Google and you literally just share your screening. You're like, "All right, yeah. So, in this video, I'm going to help you do your due diligence on us." First of all, my name's Ryan Clark. Like, let me go Google myself and the word scam and let's just go through it together and see what we find and let me try to lend a perspective on anything that we may find together. Let me go look up the company Warrior Babe. Let's type in Reddit. Let's type in the word reviews. Let's type in the word scam. And let's just let's just go through it, you know? Let's just look and let me let me show you what we find because I understand what you're looking for. You're looking for how [ __ ] you could get if you do this deal with us and how bad it could technically be. And I want to show you in this video. I want to show you what we do to keep you safe and how how we, you know, I want to demonstrate it. So, let me let me do what a lot of people would never do for you and actually just help you do your research. Here we go. And you just jump into it. You know, it's like, dude, again, you can't tell me a [ __ ] single person, you know, Ryan, that's ever told you to make a video like that. I guarantee it. And when you make a video like that, I can't stress it enough. It it diff It's like a modern tactic. Simply put, it's like, yeah, the pendulum swung back to being able to take these types of like longer form content consumption oriented strategies, but they're not the same as what they were. You don't just get to like fire I have a guy, we just signed him on as a client. pretty pretty risky deal to a degree, but I got a great rev shot on the deal. He went from 1.4 mil a month down to 300K a month. Do you know what he was doing? Automated webinars, outdated callfunnel tactics. He he was doing everything from like 2015, 2016. He hadn't updated a single [ __ ] thing. Worked for him while it worked. Didn't work now. And it's like the monkey the monkey with the nut in the stump analogy. You heard that one? Where it's like there's a nut in the stump. Monkey reaches his hand in. Soon as he grabs it, he can't get it out cuz his hand's in a fist. Tiger comes along. All the monkeys got to do is let go of the [ __ ] nut. He doesn't and he ends up dying from the tiger. It's like that guy's business would have died. It's like I came into it, updated his confirmation, paid 19 best practice videos for the breakout bids right away. Turned those into value dense email sequences along with a few other ones. Got him to film a fuckload of hammer them videos. Updated his frontend content as well because we we do care about the front end, too, to be clear. We have a lot of tactics for that too. And we also had him do a live webinar instead of an auto webinar. Bro, you want to just guess the amount of additional revenue in the first 30 days we cleared that guy from 300 back to a million. Dude, we got we got him from 300K to just shy 700 within about three weeks. It's like the level of impact is extreme to be clear when you take the right actions instead of just a bunch of outdated actions that no longer work. And I can't stress it enough. How many people have people bought courses from at this point that have just gotten straight up burnt? You know, how many of them can you go look up where you just go type in and you get propaganda that like courses are the devil and like every one of them's a [ __ ] scammer? It's like I'll give you a good one. Like I live in Miami, Florida, and I actually live in a penthouse. It's like, do you know how many little dumb asses with curly hair say that they live in a penthouse in Miami that are like apartments? You know, there's a guy a couple floors down from me that said that that constantly says his is a penthouse. It's a small apartment on the side of the apartments that are small. It's like I can't stress it enough, you know? Even something as simple as that. It's like I have to I have to show that like it's an actual penthouse. You can land a helicopter on my balcony how big it is. You know, little things. There's so many [ __ ] dumb asses that run it around, say, "Oh, I live in a penthouse in Miami." It's like when I say it, I I immediately align myself to that. So if you think about that same example with, okay, if you sell a course, if you sell info, it's like you're immediately aligned to whatever the person thinks about courses and info. And when you demonstrate through this radical transparency effort of what I just demonstrated in those two video examples, you're going to differentiate yourself instant fuckingly comparatively to anybody else. You get what I mean? Yeah. No, 100%. I mean, especially what you said around the like kind of zooming way back, but the the sales marketing, the blame, and then how much marketing can affect it just through these things, like we're kind of starting to get into that whole like, well, if sales close this, and if they increase by 10%, which is like KPI on close rate. We we call it sales per booking. So, just like total count of bookings, total total total, and then total closed. And then it's like we divide that out and if you're at whatever 15% you're crushing, which is 30% close and 50% show, right? The blend. And they're like, "Well, if they did this, then CPA would be this." And it's like, "How much can you help that with all these things you're talking about? How much can you help that with proper follow-up sequences, hammer them, strat, like this, this, like these different pieces?" And then, of course, there's a function of sales that I just drives me crazy. The main impact we see, like I said, is like we're just trying to turn the sales people that, you know, could be good, might be bad, whether they're good or bad, like we just want them to have the highest probability of layup deals and turning them into a cashier. So, all all the backend stuff specifically, obviously that won't impact cost per call and things like that. That's going to impact specifically all the back-end statistics, show rate, close rates, how long your sales cycle is, how many pipss you're getting on average comparatively to payment plans. Um, and and these are the statistics that are impacted most by a lot of what I've discussed here today specifically front-end tactics. It's like, dude, there's so we have that, believe it or not, this guy double [ __ ] us on how good of a result he got right away. his show rate went up dramatically. The guy who was in the 30s and went into the 70s, well, his cost per call, I don't remember the exact initial cost per call. I think it was either in the high 100s or low 200s, he got it down into the 60s. Okay, so we have a fuckload of stuff we could talk about in the front end, too. And and again, like front end matters a lot to be clear. Like we love we love obviously optimizing the front end. That's obviously in our wheelhouse and fully within our control. But yeah, to turn your sales people into essentially just cashiers and people that can close layup deals all day, I don't think there's a greater priority that you could focus on because that's like that's generally where the most leverage is, you know, and if and if you do basic math, which most people never [ __ ] do, and you throw things into a financial model and you quantify like the difference of a 10 20% show rate, maybe maybe on the higher end you see a 30% lift in show rate for some of these things. It's like that's huge in terms of the numbers. It does. You get more cap collected per sale and people that are willing to trust you and actually buy. Again, huge [ __ ] differences. Even if you see no lift at all in show rate and close rate and just an AOV and pips, you know, let alone you take all combination of these things and do literally all of them. It's just Yeah. It's it's it's really hard to [ __ ] that up, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean right now like seriously the KPI is you said like 70% and we keep thinking 70%. And if we go from 50 to 70 like it is massive. Oh you should dude I mean it's it think about it right like one out of two people are essentially saying I've got something else better than talking to these guys. Yeah we get a lot of cancel today we had 30 cancelled by like noon cancels not no shows which is very interesting right it's like oh schedule self canceled or or set or cancelled uh self-ancled. Yeah, that's insane. That that really goes to show to be clear. Like I said, to me that's You do a ton of volume too. So like it's like it's still But yeah, it's like No, I understand. Look at your scale like 30 calls might be like [ __ ] a couple percent for the day worth of calls. I get it. But either way, like 30 calls, you know it in terms of revenue how significant that is in dollars. I bet you still care about those tens of thousands of dollars. I do. That's why like what happens in I'm curious. So like what is cuz I okay I want to do some of these questions like we said we'll pick and choose some of them but like for the CMO wants to get into your group I think obviously value is there but like what is that so people fully know like what's included in there so obviously your systems your stuff you're hanging out with other people doing it like your average person inner circle offer specifically yeah yeah we do twice a month one-on-one calls 30 minutes believe it or not most people don't even book them from how efficient everything is answered in writing we generally find that most of the people are busy and rich so they book calls when they need to, but you can book up to twice a month. You're more than welcome to, to be clear, and we have more than more than enough availability to have that happen. We do weekly group calls. We do those on Saturdays at 11:00 a.m. As an example, the most recent request was literally earlier today, a couple hours ago. On a one-on-one call, I was talking to a guy spending 35k a day. And he was asking about testing structures and like how he could test ads more efficiently than how he was. He didn't really have a good way to test at scale. And somebody else asked a question about that and I was like, "Hey, you know, we could talk about this on this upcoming Saturday call." So, it's like self- requested by members in the group and then kind to a degree put up to a vote, you know, where everybody can kind of say like, "Yeah, that's what we want to talk about." We do our quarterly masterminds. So, we do them in January, April, July, and October. The Q3 one's coming up here in the middle of July. And then we have our um Oh, we also have AI Jeremy, by the way, which is [ __ ] insane. I heard about that. 4.2 million data points trained on that thing. Everything including calls like this get uploaded one-on-one calls, client calls, consulting calls, every message I send, every voice note I send, uh, every single thing I obviously create and document, period. Every course video I've ever done, like literally all of every SOP is all uploaded into this thing. And it's and it's not it's not just unorganized data that's uploaded into it. We actually organize the brain and levels for like what it communicates about at a higher priority than others. It's simply put it's very effective for talking to it about what you know you need to know and all of the course content and everything that we provide to the people who join which is a substantial amount in terms of a course library access those are for like your exploratory learning you know for like your okay these are the things that I either kind of like an executive summary versus the full book it's like I I don't even know I need to know this let me watch this and see if it applies or hey I I want to learn this same thing but in an expanded way go watch the lesson lessons and then outside of that very active group chat. We do all our group chats on Telegram in our case. We find the organization to be superior in comparison to any other community based platform that we could be on. And um yeah, I mean to be clear like just today we had a guy doing 700k a month join. Our minimum to be a part of it's 100k a month. Obviously you're well in excess of that. There's 18 people in there currently that do a mill a month. Uh the highest one in there currently does 5.7 mil a month. And yeah, everybody I mean to be clear like it's kind of shocking but you get perspective from like all ends of the spectrum. And even the people that are at like the lower levels of revenue, they still have significant amounts of data to contribute because usually they can run differently comparatively to the big people. And the lessons from the big people apply very differently to the small people. The range of perspective is so extreme. I learned a lot from my own mastermind. I know it sounds super pretentious to say cuz I obviously run it and like I make all the money off of it in this case. I'm the one getting paid. I This is the best mastermind I've been a part of. No, dude. It's It's real. It's um Yeah. Like our tremendous ship from my own group, you know? Yeah. It's so cool. Like we um you know, we never pitch or anything in masterminds. Like obviously you're already paying to be a part of the group. Every person that speaks is from the group itself because it's full of awesome people that know a lot of [ __ ] Um you know, we give out in our group. We celebrate million-dollar months. So every time you get your next million a month or every time you hit your first million a month, we give a big ass trophy celebrating your win and we generally have you do a talk if you want to. Not everybody's available to come and do the talks, but you know what, whatever. They're still all great. And then we bring in an occasional outside of the group guest speaker, but yeah, pretty rare. And um yeah, I mean obviously we understand the game. Like it's it's pretty simple. Well, it's very different than other masterminds in that regard because most masterminds are just like, you know, an actual mastermind where like you go to a like an event and you like sit down maybe once a year or twice a year with a bunch of people you don't really know and like you kind of like surface level network with some folks and maybe you get a dinner in or two where if you're lucky to get invited to it, you get a deeper conversation with some guys. True. In this case, it's like, you know, imagine showing up, you know, upwards of four times a year, which we don't, we get about onethird of the group that shows up to each one of the masterminds in terms of total quantity versus total members. And, you know, the quantity of people and the types of people that show up to each one change. Like some people have a preference to go to just Q4, just Q1 or like you know, the summertime ones are generally a little lighter, although although this year it's not. And uh anyway, I digress. Point I'm trying to make is now comparatively you show up to a group session like this in person. Well, you already have like been very active inside of a community seeing what these people do and how they do it. You've likely already communicated and coordinated with them ahead of time. It's like you show up with much deeper connections with people that are already a part of it. And you get the benefits of meeting a bunch of people you don't already know. And then that deepens your relationships when you go back to digital again and are just learning from people. Well, you kind of put a face to the name when you meet them in person, obviously, or when you meet them digitally and then get to meet him in person. So, it's really it's really cool. I haven't um I haven't seen anybody have any willingness to like actually do things like what I do with like one-on-one stuff or like even just weekly group calls. I um I made it my mission. I truly have so much fun just helping other people get richer, you know, because then I get richer, too. And it's still, believe it or not, it's still a fraction of what I make in total. So, I think that helps a lot. This is very important as a principle that I deeply believe to be true with this because I make so much on rev shares from the client side of our business on the agency and again we make make good money with the with the inner circle to be fair but it's like again it's still a fraction of what we make as a whole because I don't actually give a [ __ ] about the individual who buys and then needs to drop out eventually. It allows me to be brutally [ __ ] honest because I'm in a position where my money comes from what I actually teach and do from revshares. And as a result of that, you get the perspective you genuinely need somebody to tell you. In comparison, imagine paying a guy where all their money comes from their mastermind in this context. Like that person's going to coddle you. Like they're going to they're going to give you advice that keeps you a part of it. you know, people make a fuckload of money, you know, and and and that's the difference. I think the person who runs it has to be financially free to the point where there's like a leader that has brutal [ __ ] honesty with you about what you got going on. That that way if they, you know, cuz I say stuff occasionally that that that can upset you a little bit, you know, hold you accountable. No, nobody likes being held accountable to a to an aggressive standard. But again, it helps you get a lot richer when you have somebody like that. regardless of your level of income, you know what I mean? Yeah. And then on the a Yeah. I mean, and completely on people who are actually doing it. You're actually doing it on the agency side. So, it's like real time. Like you said, the pendulum like you'd still be teaching 2020 tactics if you stopped in 2020 and made all your money now on info education. I can't stand people like that. Like that's such a [ __ ] scam. That's an actual scam, you know, to to to teach [ __ ] and not actually be doing it in real time. Like, [ __ ] that, dude. I Yeah. No, I I don't resonate with that. Yeah. But moral of the story is I I'm very uh I mean that's where we get all our stuff in real time, you know, is was from just doing stuff. This where we originate all these ideas ICP on that side on the client side. Yeah. Yeah. Because you said Yeah. A couple different things like monetization method profit share or I'm sorry individual characteristics. I call them my perfect client traits. Okay. 23 23. Yeah. They're very particular because as you can imagine if the probability to get to 10 mil a year according to that US Bureau of Labor Statistics is.1% to hit 10 mil a year. This is very important to understand like my front-facing content on YouTube is helping people with these lessons from hitting million-dollar months. But when we do a client deal, I have to help the person net a million dollars on actions trackable back to me for me to get a 100k a month on that deal. which means I generally need to take somebody to at least two million a month with smaller margin businesses, sometimes more than that. So, our true scale that we reach with clients is it has to be a few million a month at a minimum in almost all instances unless it's super high margin or unless we have a lot of leverage in the deal and just get a higher rev share. But yeah, simply put, it's always high ticket. It's always some kind of high ticket product or service. Ideally, it's higher margin, but we don't care if it's info. About half our deals at this point are info. The other half range across a pretty wide range of of services, just kind of high ticket services and other high ticket products. Like as an example, that hyperbaric chamber example, I provided red light panels. Uh we had a guy who was selling a $35,000 infrared sauna with red light panels integrated into it as a great example of a high ticket product. Um anyway, it's some kind of high ticket product or service. The person's cool and they understand the game. Let me be really clear when I say this. I believe advertising is gambling but with a higher probability in comparison to what most people view gambling as. Gambling is how rich people get far richer and eventually wealthy. And almost all the deals that we have, they go through this process. I I I've referred to this as summiting. Okay, let me explain the system real quick so you can understand the thesis here. I think it makes a lot of sense. You're likely there yourself as an example. The one of the very first things you generally attempt to accomplish when you first try to get richer is leveling up stuff. You know, like it's different for everybody what you might buy first. Like when what I very first bought was some clothes. I used to love the brand called Y3 and I felt like the [ __ ] man walking into Y3 and like buying a few hundred sweater or some [ __ ] like that, you know? And then eventually like your whole closet's full of [ __ ] and you're just like what's next, you know? And then sometimes it's like cars, sometimes it's houses, sometimes it's none of the materialistic stuff. Sometimes it's like okay well I remember putting my mom and my stepdad on payroll. It's like well that felt great you know but that was like a later stage summit for me as an example and once you overcome that it's like again it's like okay what do you got to do like pay off mortgages and like take care and and once all that kind of stuff gets done okay once you officially like check all the boxes and I call it summiting because I compare it to climbing a mountain where like you reach these levels where you achieve like a small summit you kind of get to stand there a moment you look at your closet in the first example and you're like yeah I mean what else am I really going to buy here you know like what should I focus on next that's going to give me the enthusiasm to to go out and get a [ __ ] load richer, you know, and then you go back to climbing the mountain again, you reach the next summit. It's like, dude, if I look at my current cars as an example, not not sound like a [ __ ] here, but like my cars are sick. I got like the [ __ ] sickest cars for like I love them, you know? I don't give a [ __ ] about what other people think of my cars. My cars are cool as [ __ ] right now. I love I universally love my cars right now. There's not a single [ __ ] thing I'd do or change about them, you know? Could I get better cars if I got even richer? For sure. But it's like in terms of summiting, that's my point is like when you reach the point where it's like you genuinely feel like you completed the step, the only thing to do after all the steps are accomplished is to start gambling. Okay? And I believe that the peak like the number one summit to reach is obviously wealth. And I think that to get there, you have to accomplish all these smaller things first that like you kind of get out of the way because then the only thing to do with your money, you you view the money differently. That's also important to understand. You have so much money and so consistently new money coming in that you can risk money in a completely different way than you ever had prior because you didn't have you didn't have additional reasons you needed money for random stuff or things or like whatever you otherwise had to spend cash on. you instead just solely are I'm going to risk money to go make a fuckload more money and just see if the guy the guy was telling you about this guy going to spend $5 million on a challenge. Okay. Why in the world is that the choice to spend $5 million on? It's like the guy's probably just bored as [ __ ] and is like could I could I gamble this f? Like what else could he possibly spend $5 million on that's going to return on a percentage basis as much as that's going to return? Like that's without exaggeration going to return hundreds of percent. It that guy could literally we had a client do $19 million this year on an event. It's like they spent sub $2 million on the event, you know, and that's a lot to spend on an event. They flipped $19 million. It's like again when you risk large sums of cash or or for some people who have smaller summits to be fair, like some people don't need my cars, you know, they just need like a car and they feel complete. You know, everybody's summits are different. But what I do find is the people that have larger summits that are like more serious stuff and accomplishments along the way, they typically gamble with greater sums by the time they get to the point of being the gambler. Okay? And when you get to the point of being the sophisticated gambler, I can't stress it enough. You have like the ultimate position to take the level of necessary risk that's required to make some serious [ __ ] cash. That is an example of a client trait. I look for that in everybody. Even if you're at a smaller level of revenue, if you've accomplished the summits and you've reached the point where I can tell you like, "All right, look, dude. Like, this month, the reason you're hiring me is because I'm going to increase the odds even further of the bet playing out. The bet still might not play out, but you're [ __ ] pushing the chips in the table right here. Not all the chips, a respectable amount of chips, but like you're pushing chips in the table right now. And I understand the game. You want to turn the chips into more chips, and you want to do it within 30 days." Okay? I genuinely consider people like me to be like modern-day money managers that are like more aggressive levels of risk. Like if you want to just take your money and like, you know, get like traditional returns, you know, go put it in a in in which you should, by the way, you should regularly invest like cash into traditional means, right? I'm not saying you shouldn't. However, when you want like the level of cash that they're trying to get and the speed in which they're trying to get it, advertising and businesses, name anything else you can get hundreds of percent of a return within a month risking cash on. Yeah. In a reasonable like pretty high probability to play out way that's safe and legal. Yeah. Very very small. Very few if any. I I genuinely can't think of any. And I I'm I'm open to being oblivious to them and having somebody tell me about some. But like in this particular case when people pay me what they pay me it is because again they are at the point where they become a sophisticated gambler. They know that this is the highest probability to turn money into even more money within the shortest duration of time in a very sustainable reasonable way that can also be scaled and leads to even more money. Like Ryan, have you not had anybody come to you and say I'll [ __ ] buy you out for like a couple hundred million relative to the amount of revenue you've done? You know, it's like, and if you have it, you're just a few connections away from some big dick coming in and just saying like, "Here's some here's some serious cash for you and your partners." Yeah. Okay. It's like we've had info guys that do 22 mill a year get bought out for a minority stake for 40 mil cash as an example, you know? It's like to be clear like what game can you possibly play where those are the outcomes? You see? So, like as an example of a characteristic, like I vet for that, you know? I look for the person who's not like on their last dollars and is like super [ __ ] [ __ ] and scared about like pushing a few chips into the table and is like, you know, gonna be a really high pressure deal where they're like, "Oh my god, like, you know, this has to work otherwise I'm fucked." It's like we're not doing deals like that, you know? It's like we're doing deals with people that, like I said, are I got more than enough chips. I'm going to take a handful of those chips, toss them your way, turn it into more money, and I'll [ __ ] front you more chips. Okay? Let's get richer. It's like that's the game. Okay? And there's again without going through all 23 of the individual characteristics that specific point as an example is at this stage of the game for where we're at, you know, it changes changes relative to where we're at where we've been at as an agency over the years is like that's the game that we're playing, you know, and there's some people that have played, you know, respectfully to them the agency game completely differently. That's just not how I've chosen to play. I've I've respected and understood my role within the game and how I'm viewed and what I'm probable to help people do. You know, I don't do this to try to exit from my agency one day. I do it for a fuckload of cash flow, you know, month over month, you know? It's like I don't just do this to, you know, have there's this one guy in the space he always says to people when they're shopping against me and him that he'll say some stupid [ __ ] like, "Oh, that guy doesn't have infrastructure." You know, it's like we got a fuckload of infrastructure, but we got infrastructure to play a completely different game. You know what I mean? It's like people come to us simply put as an example of another characteristic when they're trying to play that game. Yeah. You know, you can go to another agency that's going to help you get like a more, you know, conservative return, place you with some random [ __ ] staff they have. you want to work with somebody like a mindset like mine and like actually have like me being the one communicating with you. It's like yeah, you're gonna pay a lot of [ __ ] money, but it's gonna be well worth it when it works out and and and it doesn't work out every time. You know, it's also important to note like we have a really high hit rate to be fair, really good success rate and long retention, but at the end of the day, it's like yeah, it doesn't always work out, but that's a part of the game, too. Like I said, it's betting, you know, it's just gambling. So, yeah. Yeah. Long story short, I could go on and on, but that's a good example of articulating. Amazing. I want to hit some of these questions. We'll see which ones are good. There's just like so many. Yeah. Yeah. Uh how we I mean we don't have to go into how we structure ad accounts and media buying when taking on new clients. Oh, here's a good one. This one's kind of funny. The classic beginner question, but like I'm actually curious. If you had to start all over again with where you are now, how would you go about it in today's market? So, assuming that's no audience, that's no money, but you have all the skills. Dude, when I very first got started, and this [ __ ] still works today. This is how we still get a majority of our deals outside of referrals that we get because we just have notoriety nowadays. But we we did this concept called video pitches. So we would sit there and we would make custom videos. We would demonstrate a strategy that we wanted to help the other person with. And my strategies over the years, even when I very first got started, were still unique to me and like things that I created and conceptualized that others weren't talking about that when you hear them, you just say makes a lot of [ __ ] sense. You know, like why wouldn't I do that? and we would pitch people on these specific strategies and then we would do this concept called valuedriven follow-up where on a week-over-week basis we would continue to demonstrate our expertise, further articulate the strategies that we wanted to do, show examples of them out in the wild of being executed and just earn the person's interest to get to the point where we'd get on a call. And dude, that's how we got damn near every big deal that we've ever done and every opportunity, especially when we first got started. So, I I believe that that's a standout strategy. I say it because I love I dude it's my favorite strategy to do because nobody ever has the willingness to like do something that's not autonomous and like highly scalable. And I'm not looking for autonomous and highly scalable. I'm looking for the right deals. I' I've never had an interest in taking like hundreds of clients and like, you know, just being a professionally well- paid babysitter. Like, I I ran that when I first started and I hated it. You know, what I what I prefer is is the sniper approach. And that approach is in my case executed through that. And I and obviously this is going to sound biased because I make a fuckload of money doing it. But I would do exactly what I do now. I just pitch people on the same exact stuff that we do today that still works that still is [ __ ] killing it. And also if I knew the stuff that I knew today, assuming that I had the same knowledge, I would do exact I would exact same thing. I might just plug a different strategy into it that's more applicable to literally right now that's probable to work. I also might adapt it to some AI stuff to be fair. Like if I was like literally starting out again, um I would consider pitching people on some AI services. I wouldn't necessarily pitch people on that as like my main thing, I would just be one of those things that I could like augment what I'm already going to do anyway and just make it more efficient or more effective for somebody through some kind of like again added added augmentation to a strategy that might make things more efficient for them. Yeah. You know, but yeah, that that'd be it. I loaded up my YouTube channel for the first time to start making these. And I literally had unlisted videos that were ones that were like sniper videos that I made from learning from your like original that was like one to like this massive real estate broker that had like and got literally phone with him. Yeah. I mean, yes. Yes. All these things like individual landing builder like for just like it was all those videos. I had to delete them. I was like I couldn't can't even look at these at how bad they were. I was I still have so many on my channel. Like my like I don't even know how many videos I have on my channel that are unlisted YouTube videos that are for like our value driven follow-up process or just straight up pitches. It's got to be in the thousands. It's got to be in the thousand. Like there's so many, dude. Dude, that's hilarious. Next one on here, lead form ads, which you talked about a little bit earlier. So we've never run these, but lead form ads versus landing page book a call ads for someone that's starting with B much lower intent type of lead. You know, like the I I personally I just did that S tier video as an example on my channel and I I named that strategy. I call it the hydra. And I don't just call it lead forms because we do some specific things like with conditional logic and like the back-end follow-up system to make it more effective. But you generally have to have a really aggressive like super hungry sales team in order to have effectiveness with lead form strategies just because it generates a lower level of interest in a lead due to the fact it's so much simpler and lower intent to fill out. generally already pre-populated with their information. Even if you do the higher intent option and you give people the opportunity to type in their data, it's still typically lower intent. Yeah, you get a fraction of the people like a small fraction that are going to go and even do something like press the button to go and consume whatever information that follows. So, the best the best strategy to like have effectiveness with that is to have a sales team of people that don't give a [ __ ] at all that the leads are coming in lower interest. Typically, these types of sales teams have to be extremely good educators. So, when you have an educator role or you have an entire sales team that plays the educator role, what they're going to do is they're going to have a lot of effectiveness communicating information to people to increase interest and then have sales-based conversations with them. People aren't dumb. Like, they know that you're calling and talking to them about something due to the fact you want them to buy it. Okay? But sales organizations that like call people and then just, oh, they didn't they didn't answer. or they're unqualified, nuke them. Like, never [ __ ] run that strategy ever if you have that type of team. You have to have people that are willing to sell via text, follow up like a dozen times before they even establish initial communication. These these people have to just be like so grateful for the opportunity that they even have people to dial on. That's kind of the frame that the sales people have to be in in order to have a lot of effectiveness with that strategy. It works legendary level when it works. But to be clear, it has a very high failure rate with organizations that just have really shitty sales teams of people that might be good with like callfunnel type leads. But and and I want to be fair and saying generally that same type of sales team will have a hard time selling with callunnel leads too. Yeah. Unless you do a tremendous job with what we talked about on a majority of this here on this call here today. Yeah. If you just do like a standard call funner where you get people to book do traditional reminders, they're going to suck ass with those types of leads, too. If you have that type of team to be clear, you still have to have a lot of information. That type of team typically does best like webinars, challenge funnels, like low ticket to high ticket stuff. This this strategy if you have that type of team is so cost effective because the leads come in so cheap for like good qualified people, especially when you leverage conditional logic and only send the right people back to that pixel and you deny the wrong people from filling out in its entirety. just drop them out of the form based on conditional logic question. But yeah, in my S tier list video, I couldn't rank it higher, I think, than like a C or maybe even a D because I ranked those strategies solely based on effectiveness across a majority of deals and across a majority of accounts that try it. So again, I absolutely love that [ __ ] but I don't get to run it a lot of the time due to back to the sales team issues. Back to the sales team issues. Yeah, you're telling me. And like you can augment that strategy with a lot of what we talked about here today, but like I said, due to the fact that leads come in at a lower level of interest in the first place, you're still going to have like a lot of touch points that are required before you actually get even on a call. A lot of those are earned via text and via written communication prior to the call. Simply put, just it it takes a lot of sales team adaption to be able to have effectiveness with that strategy. That's that's all it really comes down to. Does that make sense? Yeah, 100%. Next one on here and we're we're going long so you can tell me whenever you got to stop but uh desirable CAC for a 6 to 8K product. So more so new rorowaz targets when you're doing stuff. I mean as low as possible you know like there's no right there's no [ __ ] static answer for like how low a cost of acquisition should be. It's like just get it as low as you can. Obviously you want to profit as much as possible. It just depends on what you tolerate you know to to give like a slightly different answer to that. That still technically in my opinion answers the question. Just don't be one of those dumb asses that's like, "Oh, I'm at like 40% on my profit margin and I'm not willing to scale." It's like a lot of people stay stuck because they don't have any willingness to push the spend up and make more money because they're at a limit on what they view their profit should be. Like I've had guys, this this I love telling this story just because it's so [ __ ] wild to me that like somebody could be in this frame at this level. a guy that was like a 25 24 to1 rorowaz had like no money in spend starts spending more money drops to like a 19 to1 immediately pulls back to spend and I'm like why in the [ __ ] world are you pulling back the spend and he was like oh my rorowaz dropped and I'm like you're at 19 to1 like you should you should like mortgage whatever you can mortgage debt as possible and fire hose spend at that [ __ ] thing. If it went down to 2 to one, you should still be [ __ ] ripping the spend. And it's like people have a very like eitheror mentality where instead of just scaling and fixing things to optimize stuff and make more money, instead they think it's an either or thing. It's like generally those people they like to think in things like good and bad, right and wrong. You know, they have they have a tough time doing boths. You know, rich people do both. Yeah. And long story short, you can scale and optimize at the exact same time. If to be fair, there's a specific threshold where your profitability is obviously no longer profitable. Yeah, like that that's a great argument to cut back and you know reduce everything and like fix [ __ ] and then scale back up again. But I don't know. I mean, what the [ __ ] you looking for that type of question? Like you'd be like $2,000 for a dude. Yeah, you should always start for spend a fuckload more money to make more money, you know? Yeah, that's such a bigger conversation. an LTV to CAC game is like so real on some of these bigger ones. Yeah, there's a good one. There's one on here. There's a big uh um big media buyer, really big media buyer in Google world. But he says all he talks about is structure sales absolutely crushes. I want to know more about creative. What the [ __ ] does the creative side look like in his world? Dude, I love First of all, let me just give like the proest tip ever for like because you do a lot of stuff like real time right now that works. The Have you Have you seen a VO3 ads yet? Have you tested anything like that for your brand? We haven't tested it. But yeah, I've I call dedicate one of your staff members or hire a staff member that can just sit there and like make VO3 ads all day cuz they take like [ __ ] forever to be able to make cuz you got to like screenplay them, you know? Like I would I would honestly have willingness to hire like a retired or like somebody that's just not getting paid enough in like Hollywood that like writes TV shows and movie scripts for a living. I would hire somebody like that to make ad scripts and sit there with BO3 and like iterate on like scripting and like tying it all together and making really good ads. We have we have an inner circle member, his name's Euan. He had 2.2% was his lowest outbound link clickthrough rate. His highest outbound link clickthrough rate in the same campaign across different adsets was 23%. Unique outbound link clickthrough rate. And this was a result of a V3 ad that was very well created that was like 2 and a half minutes long, you know, made 8 seconds at a time. Yeah. And um anyway, there's a lot of people that are that are taking advantage of that now inside of my world, especially the ones that are like more like faceless or like people that can just have like others or have benefited from like UGC stuff in the past. Point being, dude, creative is in in my opinion typically best with some form of a video ad. I deeply believe in videos being more powerful than images due to the interest spectrum. You just get you just get a higher level of intent from people that can come through better framed on an ad. and and therefore your landing pages can be a lot more simplistic. When when you have a very low intent like curiositydriven ad, that's going to force you to build a page completely differently. And and due to the lack of sophistication and education of most people who are business owners that are marketing, tying those two things together, they'll just [ __ ] throw an ad up and a landing page and they don't correlate those two things at all. You you have to have creative that brings a high intent individual through the process. And if that is the case, you can have a simplistic page. If you have a very low intent, low curious, like just just base level lead, then you have to have a page that does an extensive amount of of interest lift in order to have a very good lead come through the process and great conversion rates as a result. So, you can obviously tie the tie the two together and have great creative and great pages. We have do we have a call funnel right now? Listen to this crazy [ __ ] I bet you never heard a statistic like this. 29% conversion rate on click to scheduled qualified call on the page. I've never even seen anything like that. I've usually seen like single digits. 29% right now. That's how dialed in the messaging is with getting enthusiastic inarket people to that page and the page [ __ ] aligns perfectly to what they expect to hear when they click to it and they convert in an extremely high rate and good feedback from the sales team too on them. And and again, my point is like that's like an insane expectation. Don't [ __ ] come to me and say, "Oh, I should get a 29% conversion rate because you said that on a video." It's like, "No, dude. You can get singledigit conversion rates on qualified book call pages and still rip like serious rop." But yeah, my point is is like, yeah, creative I I typically buy towards videos just due to the effectiveness on the interest spectrum. However, we do a lot of images as well. Um, a lot to be fair, but yeah, such significant differences. It just depends on the brand. You know, if it's a personal brand, you should be doing videos all day. You know, you're going to do a lot of videos anyway for a lot of the strategies we run. In my world, we like content ad strategies. You know, I'm I'm one of the few advertisers that I've ever met that spends a fuckload of money on content distribution because I've seen its effectiveness in the sales process and how much it can sway buyers. Whether it's like the hammer them strategy where it retargets at specific points in the sales process or whether content is what originated the leads being in the world in the first place and then we follow up with direct response strategies. There there's so many different individual content ad strategies that we've that we've conceptualized that are unique to us over the years. And that's a big part of what we do, too. And again, all those are videos. Like none of none of those are images, you know? They're always [ __ ] videos. Yeah. But yeah. Anyway, yeah. So, when you take on these new deals, you're doing like you're coming up with content list. you're coming out or you're writing full-on scripts and then they're shooting all these like when you partner with a lot of I'm not sure if I can share my screen on this thing, but a lot of a lot of what we do is we'll make like full-blown ad ideas for these people and scripts. Sometimes we'll give them like more like general outlines of what we want them to say and in other instances we'll give them like full-blown like actual like word for word things. It's really dependent on the client, you know. Sometimes sometimes we prefer to have like teleprompterss and things like that, although more rare. Other times they just prefer simple like, you know, talk like this kind of stuff and and touch on these general points. But we'll film like upwards. We we typically do hook body call to actions in our ads. That way we can interchange them. Yeah. And yeah, we have a lot of like creative testing strategies that we deploy at different levels of scale that vary give or take like how much we're spending per day. But but yeah, most instances we'll film like kind of like kind of like Legos, you know, like interchangeable sections, but we'll have them film the entire thing at once. And then let's say we get like 15 unique ads from a client as an example. Well, in that instance, we have, you know, the 15 unique hooks, the 15 unique bodies, and then the 15 unique CTAs. And in most instances, we'll also get approved B-roll folders from the clients as well that we can interchange. And we end up having a very extensive amount of creative. And ideally, that creative hits so we don't have to get them to go film another 15 in a in a short time frame because if it does hit, you know, we we work with busy, rich people for a living. So all the advice that we give people is not something that's time and effort intensive. It's intended to be efficient and very very conscious about the individual's time that is taking action on these things. So we we try to have a wide range of hooks and a wide range of bodies and and not necessarily a wide range of CTAs. Those are generally very similar to be fair, but the uh yeah the interchangeableness of our ads plus B-roll gives us a tremendous amount of creatives that we get to run. And then yeah, from there it's it's opinion based to a degree. You know, we try to, you know, project what we think might be most probable to work and we always mix in stuff that we do not believe is probable to work because we don't want to be right. We just want to make money. Yeah. No, no, that's real. And there are you guys I mean, you're mainly on Meta, but do you guys do multi- No, we we run traffic on all on all channels to be clear. I I consistently talk about Facebook and Instagram ads due to the fact that's where a majority of the spend goes out from our clients to be fair and from a majority of the people that come to us. Uh we still spend a great chunk of change on things like Google Adwords. Um Tik Tok's a little scary to be fair. Like not everybody scales up on Tik Tok due to the fact it's like a banned conversation here in the United States every 90 days on a rolling basis. But yeah, I mean we still have a good chunk of change that we spend on Tik Tok as well. Um, we have a small fraction to be fair that spend on LinkedIn. It's like 20 times more costly comparatively to almost every other ad channel. We we generally don't do anything else on a lot of the other ad channels. If we do, it's like a test or like, you know, something super marginal, but yeah, we're we're very well versed on the other ad channels as well. Yeah. Cool. Cool. And then quick mindset stuff or not even mindset, but like vision. So, what are you doing? Where are you taking this? Like what's your what's your target? You've got this big ass mastermind. you got this big ass agency with the correct monetization model that can, you know, scale to the moon. Like, where where are you going with this? Look, I I love money so much and I understand the impact that it has on both my life and everybody else that I help get richer. My Look, I'm not in any way, shape, any way, shape, or form, I'm trying to virtue signal when I say this, okay? I genuinely love money so much. You know how people ask that question to you? I'm sure you get it all the time, Ryan. What's your hobby? you know, like what do you enjoy doing besides making money? And I personally am like my my dopamine fires off at such an aggressive rate, you know, if you did brain scans on me, I bet I'd be in in like an insane spectrum comparatively to like a drug user, you know, and I can help other people get richer. It's like it's like hardwired in me that this is my favorite thing to do. And I'm I'm deeply self-aware about that. And you know how people always get to say things and not everybody gets to resonate with it where they're like, I truly love what I do. This is like my favorite [ __ ] pastime and it makes me money and is my literal business at the same time. I am at a point where I've built a great world that continues to expand thankfully where I just get to do literally what I love. It's my favorite hobby. It's my favorite pastime. It's my favorite topic of conversation. like this exact thing, Ryan. I truly don't even view it as any other way than just we got to talk about money for a good hour and a half here today. And and it's exactly what I wanted to talk about and spend this time doing. And it's probably what I would have spent the time doing anyway with somebody else regardless. You know, the more I get to talk about it, the more I love my life and the more enthusiastic I am. And and and more importantly from like more like a mission driven perspective, I deeply believe in the power of money. I think that rich people are some of the most important people on earth. I believe in the impact that we make. I believe that we are some of the most philanthropic people that exist, even when we're not intending to be. You and I get to go to a dinner and tip a guy a thousand bucks like it's 20 bucks to us. You probably more than me to be fair. You make a lot more than me. But I I can't stress it enough. It's like you get to make so much impact and and you get to build and and actualize things at a speed in which that people without as much money don't get to do. And as a result of that, like we impact the world faster and at a greater scale comparatively to anybody else. So the more people I can get rich, the more rich I can get, which again I absolutely love. I love money. And like I said, I'm not virtue signaling. I do everything I do to get richer, but at the same time, I get that added benefit of like it's my favorite pastime, you know? It's like I don't [ __ ] golf. I don't I don't sit around and do [ __ ] all, you know? I watch an occasional basketball game cuz it's across the street with the Miami Heat here. But it's like other than that, dog, this is like the [ __ ] greatest life ever that you could have blessed me with. And I I hope to just perpetuate it, make it bigger, you know, scale my impact up and and be a person who you can have a good genuine conversation with about getting as rich as you possibly [ __ ] can. You know, that's here to help you do it, too. I don't know what I would do differently, man. This is this is what I've always envisioned and this is this this is it, you know. I love it. I uh I just think it gets bigger from here. Is it, you know? I agree. I agree. No. Well, this was good. I I mean, we went 35 over, so I I'll cut it here. But no, we definitely need a part two that's mindsetty. That's all that cuz I mean, I watch all your stuff. I've watched it forever. You know, I'm a D1 yapper, Ryan. I can talk all day about about all this stuff. Like I said, my favorite things to talk about, man. Whenever you're ready. Let's see what the people say with this first one and then you want me back on. Red carpet's out for you. I'll come out to Miami. It'll be better. But cool. All right. Well, people know where to find you, right? YouTube act. So, those are two. Yeah. Yeah. Check check out my YouTube. You know, I drop twice a week YouTube videos like what Ryan was saying at the beginning of this. They're they're all bangers, you know. I try I try to just help people get richer with those. And then uh you ever want more serious stuff, obviously, you know, to just pay me because that's ultimately where the real value is. And um yeah, I don't I I do other stuff like I have the I have so I have the Twitter people. I take all my YouTube videos and like populate it all on Twitter for me. Uh I do stuff on Instagram. You get follow me on Instagram's great. Instagram. Yeah. You're at Jeremy, right? Just add Jeremy. That's right. Yep. Just good. Yeah, man. I mean, just just tap in, you know. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Then I'll message you offline because our CMO is very serious about it and like so we'll have to figure out how or who gets to go to that or what. So, we'll definitely do that. Looking forward to helping you get richer, man. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. Well, that's day 104. This will come out tomorrow morning, actually. I usually do these on day, but I had one earlier today because I'm traveling this weekend, so I wanted to make sure I could batch them. You can stack it up. Stack it up. All right, cool. Well, I will talk to you soon. Appreciate it. Bye one.

# $77M Collected. 5 Funnels. Here’s The Setup. | EP103
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvyL8HJd6kg

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we collected $77 million with five funnels and the entire data and tracking structure behind it. Normally, you'd have to pay someone on your team or a service provider tens of thousands of dollars to figure this out and then implement it. And I'm going to give it to you completely for free. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in this info coaching business. Like I said, over 77 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale this business to over 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. It's going to be a little more advanced, a little more technical. Stick with me, okay? This is going to be super helpful for how you think about this. So, we're going to have properties. We're going to have funnel stages. We're going to have funnel IDs. And we're going to have some subpropies. And I'll get into what those mean, but let's go through the funnels. Okay. So, I say five funnels as one, two, three, four, five. Okay. Now, what these are, and I'll kind of bounce back and forth for you, and I've explained this in other videos, but trust me, you want to stick through this. So, four here, you're going to have your opt-in VSSL funnels. So, an opt-in VSSL funnel is name, phone number, email. For us, it's just name, and email. We have not had it where it pays off the phone. And they go to a VSSL page. Okay? They watch VSSL, the button pops up. Cool. They then go and apply. There's a ton of automations that occur between all of these. If someone opts in but doesn't uh apply, so if someone applies but doesn't book a call, etc. Okay? So, they're going to go from an opt-in to a VSSL, get a bunch of emails, push back over here to an application, and they're going to apply. When they apply, they are then routed through this router on based on their application questions. They get DQed or they get quality. Okay? So, they come in as quality, and then a portion of them get DQed based on financial qualifiers or things that do not fit for your ICP. Okay? You are then only going to pixel these pages. You're not going to pixel any of this stuff. All right? So, then what's going to happen is they're going to book a call. They're going to lend then then land on a success page that has all the goodies on it. And I can go through these in other videos where it breaks down what's on there, but essentially you're going to have objection blocks. You're going to have your, you know, pre-frame preframe video. You might have some homework they do. You have all that kind of stuff. And then they're booked. Now, they're technically booked over here with a closer. So, I could actually change this to a closer call over here. But what's actually happening is then a setter is calling and confirming them. This is newer to us. And the funny part about this, I say 77, 71 million of it was this right here. this one right here. So hopefully you can see my mouth on here, but it was essentially through here and we didn't even have a routing. So it actually just went through this. So it was one line through, no setter whatsoever, and straight to a closer. Okay, ton of volume, ton of money left on the table, like high t like not high, but low to mid tens of millions of dollars were left on the table because we didn't have setters, because we didn't have offer, all these other things. Okay, so that's the core one. All right, come through closer. Setter confirms the call, they get on with the closer, and then they close. Now, why I have three of these right here and why there's actually six of them, but right now we're only running three of them because the other three are in Q and uh edits and all that kind of stuff. And the reason these are two different colors is because these are different brand faces. So, right here you have brand face one and and down here I use the examples of Mary, right? So, Mary is in this VSSL and she is talking about um in these examples, what did I use? Thyroid. Okay, so it's different messaging. So on your opt-in page, your ads over here, you have different ads. So actually you should probably have three of these for you because there's three different campaigns, three different whatever you want to structure adset, what however you're going to say it, but essentially three different campaigns where you have brand face one that's talking all about um what did I say? Thyroid. Yeah, thyroid as a messaging. I'm just using examples here. This not our actual. So um they come into here messaging with brandace one and thyroid. It's on it's in the ad. It's in the opt-in page. It's in the VSSL and then they go to the application. also why we start to get into all these properties. Why is this important? I'm kind of all over the place, but trust me, because these have different automations because they need to come from a different brand face. So, you need different tracking, you need different uh triggers, you need different properties, you need all that kind of stuff that exists because there's different messaging around the different messaging and also from uh the different people, different brand faces. Okay? So, we are trying to diversify brand faces because that is important for us as we scale into the future both for market resonance as well as potential exit in the future. All right? So this will be one messaging pocket. This is another messaging pocket with the same uh brand face. So this one's around thyroid. This one's around muscles. Okay, let's just say. So you're going to have these. These need different tracking. They need different word like copyrightiting. They need different things both on the page, in the ad on the page, in the VSSL, in the email follow-up and all of that. Okay. Now, for us, we're standardizing and centralizing it around application. Now, this one up here in the purple is a first time us launching a full setup over here for brand phase 2. All right. So brand phase two could be talking about the same messaging, could be their own story, could be whatever. And that's where you have different messaging, different funnels, different automations, different email, all this stuff, okay? And different ads. So you have campaign one runs to this, campaign two runs to this, campaign three runs to this. Automation one, automation two, automation three. They all are pushing to this application, okay? They go through same flow in here. All this DQ stuff just doesn't fire the pixel, but does the exact same flow. Um because currently, like if we were booked that capacity, we would just turn this off. And that's what this is right here. So, we have an automatic, this technically a two-stage router, but you have router number one, and then router number two checks the active calendar spots, and if there is x amount, whatever call it 10% uh only remaining on the calendars, it'll just turn them off from being able to book if they're DQed, it'll always let through the booking one or the quality ones, and it'll push them to this bridge page. Okay? And then we'll get into that. Goes over here to low ticket. But DTA is extremely common. Extremely. Follow me on X. I just asked for a good script on this because we run these but not as effectively as a lot of other people do because this kind of like was our game for a long time. Um, and we haven't adapted fully. DTA page. This is going to be your headline VSSL application. Some people wait to pop the application. Whatever. Now of this you could have right now we actually have three of these. One is only winning and one is the core one. So I only have one showing here. But exact same where you could have one, two, three right here. You could have different brand face versions. So I could have three different colors here, three different DTA pages, three different campaigns. The ad is brand face. The VSSL on the page is brand face. And the messaging and the copyrightiting on page and then comes over here. Now why this is different is because it doesn't have an automation that passes them from here to here. Okay. So once in our current flow and this is our current adaptation of this. So this may change and I will update you if it changes. But in current flow once they get past the application stage it pushes over into brand face one co-founder all the language that's coming from the company or the main brand face of the company the founder of the method the whatever and then these are brand faces only in communication here pushing them from opt for essentially lead to application okay now same thing comes over here runs through the same router now low ticket a little bit different low ticket is we're actually selling something that is low ticket so it's under $100 we send them to a sales page in current state it's brand face one campaign brandace one ads brandace one is on here here and then I'm sorry so they go from a sales page they then go to a checkout page they put in name email here x amount percent complete from here to here they then check out here land on here and then instead they are doing a booking with a setter so they're booking in a call that's like a quick start call implementation call whatever they'll book that in with the setter then the setter triages them or sets them up sets them with a closer and that's the flow of this one this one has the best stats in terms of the ascension, the show rate, the set rate, the whatever. The economics are great, except right now ours is breaking right here. So, because we can't scale it to enough units, the math doesn't back out because let's say you get 3% or whatever that come through or 5% or 10% or whatever, you'd have to sell, let's, you know, use three as an example. If you got a 100 new units a day, on average, you would only get three of these backend purchases, which is just not enough volume. Like, we need tens and tens and tens of these back-end purchases. So, every time you try and scale this, it breaks. Now 7 and 1/2 minutes in how I break these down in properties. And so this is a lot of this was initially happening and we have a marketing tech that's aing badass that just came in that is helping us structure this and we kind of like bounce back and forth with some 10 million plus a month guys that do info and how they do this with multifunel. So what we're going to have here is your core properties that exist at a contact level and this is where I start to get a little more advanced so just like stick with me. Uh you're going to have your low ticket optate. You're going to have your low ticket purchase date. So when this triggers is an opt-in. when this triggers technically between here and here it's a purchase setter call date is then this one comes in here is the only one that's getting a direct setter booking okay so it's going directly on the calendar versus these they're calling the bookings uh that are with a closer so these actually aren't setter calls I should have put better arrows and stuff but we're moving quick today all right I got somewhere to be so VSSL opt-in date is going to be any of these three application date is anytime someone fires on this or this right so here here and now Now you see where I'm starting to run into an issue where where did they apply from? Okay. And which opt-in did they come through? Sales call booked date. So the day that they clicked the button of when they booked the call. All right. Sales call date which is the within 48 hours. What date and time whatever they actually booked the call for. And then backend purchase date is going to be this. Okay. Now these all exist at a contact level because a person can do any of these actions. They can do all of these actions. All right. Now, where this be became an issue is what I'm saying here is like VSSL opt-in date. Which VSSL optin did they come through? Okay. And what you could do is stack these properties up like crazy where it's like, okay, they came over here, they came over here, have nine different VSSL opt-in fields and different dates, but the action of what they're doing is still an opt-in. It just is different in terms of which funnel they came through. So, we're like, how do we make this more dynamic? Okay. The next layer, this has already existed as well, is having funnel stages. So, the other thing that's going to happen is someone is going to come into here. They're gonna opt in, but they're not going to apply. Okay? And then they're gonna exist in your email sequence. They're going to exist. They're gonna exist. And they're gonna see an ad 14 days from now, and they're going to reopt in. Now, what you want to happen when someone reopts in is them to get the email automations again that occur between opt-in, lead, and application. Now, in order to do so, you're looking to see if this is known. We use HubSpot for this, but like a workflow, and it's like, okay, is this known? And then, can this reenroll them? Yes. But there's nothing directly. There's like a lot of ways to do this. So, someone else is going to listen to this and be like, oh, you're idiot, and there's like 90 other ways to do this. This is how we do it, okay? And it works. So on this, what we'll do is when someone comes in with a VSSL opt-in date, we'll mark them in a funnel stage property that's like a drop down that'll mark them as a lead. When they apply an an application, when they book, a book, when they purchase, purchase. Now, what happens though is after x amount of days, we have these in like this queue that if they haven't moved from this stage to this stage or if they haven't moved in x amount of time, it will clear this out so it doesn't exist. Then all of your workflows are truly triggered off this instead with lead and app. So like did they are they uh lead but no app they get the lead no app. Are they app but no booking? They get the app no book. And it's based on this. This is for storage of the data of what happened. You technically store the records even when they overwrite. This is for where they're actually at and what triggers the automations. Now you can say the same thing as the issue here where okay yeah they're a lead but what type of lead? Where did they come from? This is the first iteration that we've had this as a problem because we initially had this standalone, this standalone, and this standalone. So, it wasn't really that big of a deal. We're actually technically running these two with the same brand face, but two different messaging funnels. And we didn't even know directly like the stats on it other than in Facebook knowing ROAZ, knowing like rough metrics and kind of doing division, but we didn't have like proper reporting on it, which is my fault. And also, we were like in L of doing a lot of things, but still my fault. Okay. Now, I have a marketing tech that's a badass like I said, and he is crushing it and doing this for us. Okay. So he is building this out all on his own which is amazing and saves my life. So now we have funnel types. How we're doing our naming conventions or I'm sorry funnel ids. How we're doing our naming conventions is type type two brand face then message. So as an example you'll have VSSL optin Mary thyroid. Okay. So you'll have it's a VSSL optin funnel. Mary's the brand face and then you'll the messaging is around thyroid as the example I used. Okay. So then up here so in these examples right Mary thyroid and then Mary muscles. That would be like this and this. Okay. So they're going to get a funnel ID when they come through that funnel and it's technically going to show like last attribution. So if they went through this one two weeks later they then came through this one. The most recent one that's going to show before purchase is the last one they went through. But you have storage and record of all of them because then you start to get this whole multiattribution and like omniresence and all of this. And this isn't even touching ad tracking because ad tracking can all happen in highros or custom also inside uh the CRM on server side or highos or whatever. But what we're trying to solve for here is inside our own data where did they exist within the funnels not as much tracking back to the ad. I mean yes to the ad but like again two different systems and all we're talking about is ours right now. So with that you then have VSSL optin Amanda for example but she could be talking about the same messaging. Okay so that's why we're trying to name it in these conventions. So Amanda muscles Mary had a muscles version that was crushing but now we have a different brand face that might get a different lift because it has better ads or better market resonance with the person. And also just diversification. Also, just having diversification. And I'm a huge fan. The reason we did 71 million is because we said, "Let's just hammer one of these and it was dumb and it broke." But like, we should have really just had like a second or a third warming up and we didn't have any. Now, we're kind of going a little too far in the other direction in my opinion. But, we're trying to figure out what works where we can get cost down and where the quality is up. Okay. Now, you have all these that come through and then for example, low ticket. Um, we have low ticket offers and then right it didn't really know what to put here. So, we put purchase and then the brand face and then what the low ticket is. Now up here, this is the only kind of wonky one of this because right now ours is actually currently named the product name because I didn't I didn't have the you know site into the future to realize that we were going to do it in this way. So we will have to change these as we kind of scale into this in the future. But the same flow will work and then it also will get its own funnel stage once there's two of them. Okay? Because it's not an issue right now because if someone opts in and then purchase, they don't really come back and opt in again and need the contextual flow. And there's so many automations and like now setter touch points and buckets and stuff that these all get hit and we have really good completion rates between these. So it's like you're not really squeezing or like missing too much um that exists. But that is definitely room for opportunity is on these right now. Now all that to say you could run any number you want now. So you can see on uh so what you do is you could go funnel stage and then one last thing sorry the automations then exist that you'll have like lead but no app. Okay. So like leave but no app for this and you'll also include for Mary thyroid and then in that one it'll be messaging from Mary around thyroid pushing to application. You'll then have the same thing here funnel stage also with funnel ID Mary muscles and it'll be from Mary talking about muscles in the copyrightiting pushing to the application. Same thing with Amanda pushing the right direction. Okay. Now again I will be the first to say this is like real overkill right now but what we're foundationally setting up for is like that direction. Okay. Okay. So, like right now we're still like having our, you know, essentially the current bottleneck is is in this realm more so than it is in the marketing realm. And then also if it was if we were to just say it's on marketing, it's in this realm because they if they could nail this and get to 100 units a day or hundreds of units a day, this has the absolute best conversion. This has the best I'm sorry, economics, not the best conversion. Well, I guess kind of both, but this has the best economics, but it breaks when we get over X units. So, if we crack this this flow, having buyers on the phone instead of leads, which these are all leads, that's like where we see most people get to at scale, whether that's a one or two product or that's a low ticket, it just creates a different ecosystem when the closers and the setters are talking to people who purchase something and have that much higher intent than somebody who is just a lead. Okay. Now, coming down to these, I basically just said, so there's different funnel stages, different flows, there's all that kind of stuff that are triggered by all these. Now, you will be able to see byfunnel. Now on the reporting side of things and I probably should have visualized this for you but on the reporting side of things you'll now be able to see if you apply just this for example on top what is the count of lead app sales uh sales call purchase and you get percentages as they flow down. Okay. So now you'll be able to see that for whatever reason and then you'll be able to isolate and find out why these two funnels next to each other you'll see your completion rates through and one has a 2% backout purchase the other one has a 12% backout purchase. And on the uh because on the VSSL page, one has 20% of people that are leads go to an application and the other one has six. So, it's like the VSSL sucks because the opt-in rate is the same, but the VSSL sucks, right? And like you'll be able to isolate those when seeing this. And this is like basics 101, but when you're running multiple of these, the BL the stats can like really blend and come through one then another, then another. So, this is an ability to isolate the most recent place that they were and see the stats on them and then how they backed out. You can also run stuff that's like multi-presence that like they hit this funnel, then this funnel and did all that stuff. But like you still need the data. The data is the number one thing here that you have structured and that you have stored because you can't run anything if you don't have it. All right. Now, subproperties. This is the next stage of this that I'm going to get built out um or the team's going to build out. The other pieces are we already technically store these things, but they don't get stored as themselves. So, what I mean by that is an app will come in, it'll be qualified or disqualified. There's not currently a like property and I'm calling them subpropies but that's not what they'll actually be like helper columns almost. What currently happens is an app will come through. It'll get assigned an application date. They'll they'll get moved to the funnel stage app. They will have come through whatever one of these funnels that has an application anything but this last one. We'll have all that data but is it quality or not quality? We know that because we look at then the application response field and we can see if it is or if it isn't and that already does all the routing and stuff in the background but it doesn't have its own field. So like it needs its own field or it needs its own helper column or it needs some like key that does lookups. Same thing with disqualified because I want to be able to know optin application split. I want to know how many of those applications were then quality or or DQ because that feeds back to ads that feeds back to the understanding of the funnel and how it performed. Because if all of a sudden it's getting way more applications but like the conversion rate is terrible. I break it down and I can see that one's one has 90 quality and 10 uh I'm sorry 90 DQ and 10 normal quality. That's why because how the people are coming in because of the messaging, because of the ads, because of the targeting, whatever you can like back into this. So you just need as many data points as possible to see where things break and then see where the throughput is breaking through those and on what stage or it could be the whole overall thing because of the front, right? So that same thing with booking. Booking can then translate over as qualified or disqualified. That truly comes from the app though. It's like if that person is already here. This one's kind of like I don't say null but like kind of null because the person at this level will have a qualified or disqualified helper column. So really this is one and the same, right? So all you really need is qualified and disqualified which come from the application questions as a helper column. And the big one this currently exists at the deal level. So the deal level when they move the stages they'll mark them as no-show, cancel, hot listing, long-term nurture, closed or like disqualified close loss like had no financial thing or normal closed loss mean they should have closed and they didn't. and a couple other ones in between there, but let's just use those. Showed and no showed is massive. And why I say that or I mean it's just massive. So like the industry standard like even ours right now is like the lowest it's been in a very long time. And we added a ton of stuff again and did the thing I didn't want to do but we did anyway. And it's like really breaking things and I need to know what the source of those is. So like which funnel they came through, which flow they came through at what times, whatever that it worked and something that you makes sense when you hear about it but like or you hear it. But for example, this is notoriously known for having low show rates because the consumption is so much lower because the friction is so much lower. So someone will come into here, they'll just literally watch a VSSL for a couple minutes instead of the whole 25minute VSSL. They will uh apply, fill out an application, they'll get they'll land on a booking thing, they'll be like cool, book, and then they'll just be like forget about it, whatever. they spent 3 minutes, 7 minutes, whatever to do this process instead of coming into here intentionally watching the VSSL getting to the point where either they got to the VSSL and the application popped or they consumed emails and got pushed back to do all this stuff before they could apply, before they could book, right? So, just that alone, and there's edge cases to all this, there's people who crush these on DTA and crush it with show rates and use iMessage and, you know, double dot and like do all this kind of stuff. Um, just in like a general sense though, that one shows more no-shows. So I need to know these things and then see them on a plot across of lead app qualified app disqualified booking qualified disqualified which again you'll already have and then also booking showed booking no showed and then come back up here to the backend purchased. So hopefully that was helpful. Um yeah hopefully that was helpful. But that's essentially how we're running things right now um with these structures and we'll see how it goes. We just got some like really dedicated reporting. It's hot on my brain right now about this um because I'm trying to like pinpoint and where we should lean into buckets where we have a higher cash collected per booking on which one because that's the whole game right in terms of the front what it really is cost per purchase but when you need to optimize around volume and make sure calendars are full you need to optimize in the one you can control which sometimes the earlier metric which is the booking is a little bit cleaner. So that's what we're doing now. Hopefully that was helpful. Hopefully it wasn't too confusing. Um I have some bangers this week coming up. So, we have some cool people. So, it won't just be me on here yapping. Um, and then I travel this weekend. So, I'm going to see how I'm going to be able to keep doing this. I was going to stop at 100, but I'm atund I don't know, two, three or something like that. And I don't know, I'm having fun. So, www.ryclub.comdoc. Um, you'll see all the videos that are on here. I'm pretty bad at updating this. I think I'm going to turn this into audio podcast. A lot of people ask for that. So, I don't know if this one is an example, but like at least the the group videos I do. Comment below on this if you made it to the end. 21. comment 21 if you made it to the end. Um, leave some just fun comments. I uh I enjoy it. And then yeah, hit me up on Instagram, hit me on X. And if you need anything, just be clear in your request. If you have a question, if you have whatever, give me data, do all that kind of stuff. Um, because that makes it a lot easier for me to help and respond and refer if you need a, you know, media buyer or a sales agency or whatever because I have some people for that or if I can just see something clear in the data and you can change it up. So appreciate you guys as always and I'll talk

# Here is how info/coaching businesses work (Full Breakdown) | EP99
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWKSGqxgRDc

In today's video, we're going to be talking about the seven layer info coaching dip recipe. I'm going to be walking through the differences between everything from onetoone coaching where you are servicing it and what you can charge for something like that all the way down to if you're just selling login access to a course and what you can charge for that. There's many differences across these on how much leverage you can get for your time and your money. So, we're going to talk through the differences on acquisition sources, on how you fulfill on these, and then also the different monetization models you can use for your info coaching business. All right, this one's going to be super valuable for anyone with info coaching business and is going to get some nuggets out of it. All right, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business and we've now crossed over 77 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what didn't work for us, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company, opportunities, and network with cool people doing cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. To start this off, we're going to talk about let's say let's use an example of you are in Bisop, right? So, you're selling some dream, you're selling some result where they're going to have XYZ business or make XYZ money online. Okay, the top top tier of this generally speaking is going to be selling one-on-one coaching with you. Okay, so there's different implementation methods. There's done for you, done with you, all these different things. But to keep this simple, we're going to go down the fulfillment stack and what you can charge. Okay, so what you can charge is how they value this, how likelyhood, the likelihood they think they're going to receive the result, um the amount of pain they have to go through, right? Go through Alex Warzosi book, that style of things. But on the very top tr uh tranch is generally speaking going to be onetoone working directly with you. Okay? So that cost you your time to do so. But you likely can get the highest dollar value. So for example, this is something you could charge 50 grand, you could charge 100 grand. You get these top guys like a Cardone or whoever. They charge hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's onetoone coaching where it's a consultation call. It's a consulting call. It's whatever. And that's for the top tier. Okay. The next tier down on that is going to be group. Okay. So it's still coaching. It's still you doing the fulfillment, but instead of you doing onetoone calls or onetoone Zooms, you're doing one too many. Okay? So people can come in and you're coaching multiple people at once. So you have leverage then in terms of you're still spending the same, let's say you had two 1-hour blocks for coaching calls, now instead of just being able to service two people for those one hour each, you're now servicing many people. Okay? Now with that, the value of it is a little less to the consumer or the person because they're not getting you one-on-one. And the price then is in alignment. So let's say this is 50K. This is then going to be something that's whatever 10 to 25K. Okay, depending on and all of these are very very variable. Okay, we're just going through the overall like mental model of this more so than we are the actual dollars because if you're selling something that's guaranteed to do XYZ and I don't know how you do guarantees, but if you're going to make them a million dollars, it could be it could be, you know, hundreds of thousands. It could be a lot of these different things. I know like a Cardone one for example is hundreds of thousands of dollars in these packages for onetoone calls with them. Okay. Now, the next tunch down on that and this is kind of the land that our main company lives in and this is onetoone coaching. Okay, so it's same as this, but instead of you doing the one-to-one coaching, you have team, you have coaches that do the onetoone coaching. Okay, now this same thing is valued at a bit less, but is more than group, right? Then um because they're getting the onetoone attention, they're getting that, but instead of it you as the expert, you as the person, it is your team doing it. Okay, so this now introduced costs where you now have to pay a team when before your costs were your time. Okay, you're going to have the other business cost and the overhead and the acquisition and whatever the other things. But in here there was no direct cost except your time but no dollars going out to fulfill on this. This is when you start to introduce dollars that uh it cost to have team. Okay. So oneto one is going to be here. The next tunch down from that is going to be something that is group one. Uh so it's going to be the same thing again as here but your team is fulfilling on it. So recap you have you doing one-on-one calls a couple hours a week. The next layer and you can charge this super high top dollar. This next layer is going to be in a group setting. So you're helping multiple people on these coaching calls. Same amount of time, more leverage. This on the next one is now you don't have to do any of these because you have a team doing one to one, but now you have to pay a team 10% 20% whatever of that cash collected. And there's people who get it all the way down to 1 to 5%. Um industry averages call it 10 15% um to pay the team. This then introduces the much lower where it's maybe only 5% 1 to 5% of your costs because your coach's time now is being leveraged by having multiple. They don't have to handle onetoone stuff. They do group coaching calls, all that kind of stuff. All right, so those are the general tranches of group um or I'm sorry, of coaching. And then we start to layer in info. Okay, and all of these can kind of be mix and mangled. And we're going to get to that on like the customization of that. That's going to drive me crazy. These are different sizes. Um but info coaching is generally going to be that someone gets access to info plus a coaching element. This is like the classic key like largest one. This is what up level was always about. This is what all these guys who productize their service. So you're always selling the same result of what they're getting. But the delivery method and the fulfillment model is that they get a login access to a course. They generally speaking will get a community on top of that and then they will get group coaching calls. Okay, there's like the very very common example. I know Eman for example did a version of this, but they had onetoone coaching calls where they had like a a team that was doing onetoone coaching calls that was I think five or six calls they would do and then they would also get access to the course, the community and then they got six onetoone calls. Okay. And then group coaching calls that exist. You have a small team and all they do is operate uh you know the twice a week Tuesday to Thursday for two-hour blocks. People submit into that thing. They get the group uh they get the group Q&A. They get personalization in the group setting. They also have the community and the product. Okay, this is the most like classic OG one. This is how we were doing 10 million a year. We were selling an info product that had group coaching calls and of course as we got more volume we just introduced more group coaching calls. But it is so marginal. The the scale and the leverage you get from one to many is massive. Okay. So, this is like the most common. Uh, the next layer down is people who just sell info and community. So, they do no coaching calls. And as we go down this, I haven't been doing a good job of this, but explaining that the cost generally speaking to the customer, what you can charge goes down as you go down this completely arbitrary that I'm like saying that at some level because there are different niches and different models that you can charge 10 grand just for an info and community. And there are also ones where it only makes sense to charge $1,000. Okay. There's also different things. If you're selling over the phone, you can charge higher uh or more. So you have to sell over the phone uh to get the good conversion rates you want over the phone um or yeah you have to use over the phone if you're going to sell something you know say call it 25k plus there again expectation there are exceptions to all of this I know people who sell 10k via DM so differences but the next layer is going to be info and community so this is going to be same thing someone gets access to a course and then they have a community around it this is very very common in kind of the lower ticket uh space um and inside like a lot of the make money online stuff they get in a Facebook group or a WAP community or school community and they have course modules and they ask questions in there. Okay, a lot of them almost I would say probably 90% live in this land where they also introduce some level of group coaching and then the next and the final is going to be like an info product course login. This is generally gray area because when people are doing this there's a lot of good of them but a lot of them will have community. The ones that have no community generally there's a reason they don't have a community and it's because they don't want people to interact and then it stirs things up and chargebacks and that whole game. We don't play this game where it's just info. We always play the lowest tier of info community where people are still inside there and generally the best one is going to be in here. Okay. Now, another thing to think about before we get into the different acquisition sources and the different fulfillment models and how to do this is stacking these. So, what you can do is essentially if you just want to look at it top up, you can have it so your tunches go like this. Okay? And this is an very extreme example, a very very extreme example. Um, but where you are making all of this big money here and you're charging this. So, in an example of how we run this, we'll go like this. So, our model is we can sell this first. Okay? So, for a very low ticket, so sub $100, we'll sell a little info product, a little course that has a community element. We will then try to get them on the phone and talk to a closer to sell them onetoone coaching. Let me move these out of the way for you guys. where we sell them one-to-one coaching where our team fulfills on it and then after x amount of time and they're in the program they can either buy this again to incre uh introduce LTV or what we will offer on the back end is instead uh downstep. So essentially it's like this. They will buy this for a low amount. They'll buy this for call it 5k 10k in here. They will then get onetoone coaching and then when they're done needing onetoone coaching don't done done needing the personalization they will then downstep to still continue to be a customer but they will exist in a oneto many situation. So it costs less to the customer because we charge less and it also costs us less to fulfill because a coach is now doing one to many. So they can have you know 300 500 per coach instead of over here they maybe only have 50 or 100 or whatever amount of clients because they're doing one to one versus one to many. Okay. So, this is like a realistic example of a three offer stack that all can play together. It's not necessarily one or the other, right? So, now that I jumbled these all up, I'm not going to be able to find them easily. Um, but there we go. So, a lot of uh what a lot of people will do is where is the good one? This. So, I know a ton of people who will direct to cart sell this for call it $2,000. So, when I say direct to cart, I mean they'll use a webinar or a VSSL or just like a checkout link that people directly purchase this. They'll do an onboarding call and then they will get sold one of these where it is actually not that one. They'll get sold this one right off the rip. And this is something that's like a 10K or a 15K offer and then they have this crazy high tier where they then will sell one-on-one coaching with them or group coaching with them on the back end and get another 25 or 50K. Okay, so it's very very common. Um very very common. Um and there's again there's a multitude of different ways to look at this. There's masterminds, there's like offer tons. This isn't so much to be around offer. is about to be how you fulfill on the product. So at the very top in the info coaching, you know, bisop land, you have masterminds that exists up here and then you have one to one. You I you go look at Russell Brunson stack where there's only a couple people in this very very top tier and they're working even then they're kind of working in a group setting, but they have onetoone with Russell. They have one to a couple people with Russell. They then have uh a bigger tunch where it's actually one to a lot of people with him where he kind of exists in this info coaching land. And then he at one point, I don't know if he's a good example for this, but had onetoone uh with where his team was doing one to ones and then where his team is doing one to many. So that's kind of just the general framework I'm trying to instill uh is that you can and you can mix and match and part in all these. So these let's do this part. So the acquisition source, the fulfillment source, and the monetization model. So there's a lot of different uh acquisition sources. I'm just going to use these three as examples. But again, go do your own research. There are more than these. Not these are not three. These are just like core three. So you have paid advertising, you have organic. So you have long form YouTube videos, you have all that kind of stuff where you built a following and you can now convert and you have affiliates. Okay. So what a lot of people will do is they will stack these into one and they will sell info with group coaching and a community. Okay. The other way to do this that a lot of people do now is either a free or low ticket community that is then charged in a recurring fashion. And to touch on these real quick, there's one-time access to something where you get lifetime access to a course. There is recurring where you will pay for a term. A lot of people will sell six-month programs or monthly recurring programs, stuff like that. Ours, for example, is an annual recurring program. Um, and then these I do want to talk about, but kind of on a separate on a separate tangent because this is more biz and like highle consulting where you can charge rev share, profit share, equity percent, or have partnerships. And that one kind of connects back to this. So, let's talk on these first. So, in a dream state, let's say you have a fitness influencer um that has like I've just talked to a couple guys and we'll use um like a Rob or whatever as an example. Okay, so who I just talked to who's a big fitness influencer. So, what he'll use is he'll use organic traffic. He'll build up a big organic audience and then what he'll push them to is an info product that is recurring. Okay? So these guys all have these apps that have really good programs in them, but instead of having to fulfill on it with onetoone coaching, they will then be able to instead uh fulfill on it in a recurring app. So they'll they build these up very very large. And then one of the things they can do is then introduce something like coaching that then has also recurring, but then they'll introduce coaching on the back that then you can choose if you want to fulfill on that through him coaching. Because if Rob was to coach somebody for a year, it's tens and tens and tens or high tens of thousands of dollars versus if he wanted to coach someone and in a group setting, so group coaching calls and like a product or whatever. This would be a little bit easier for him, but it would, you know, charge less because the person's not working onetoone with him directly all the way down to like what we do, which is onetoone with the team. He would have a team of coaches. They would get onetoone support, onetoone planning, onetoone like adjustments, all that stuff. And it would work through the team. But then he would have to manage a large team. Okay? And that's where a lot of these guys don't want to. And I completely understand why they wouldn't when they have the really really good life of they always talk about lifestyle by design, but they'll come into here. They'll have an organic engine. They focus mainly on this piece on this organic content machine. It then pushes people into this info product that's low easy barrier entry. They get MR recurring revenue. And then if they so choose, they then usually have partnerships. So they'll have uh like Rob's example we talked about yesterday is almost all these fitness influencers will have two. They'll have a apparel and they'll have a supplement. So he'll get apparel and supplement revenue that comes both from people inside this community and just from organic direct. And then they will have if they so choose to have an increased like coaching style program that instead of $100 a month or $15 a month or whatever they can upstep or uh ascend into something that is like uh you know 5k for six months or whatever for these coaching programs. You just have to determine how you're going to fill on it. And for these guys, sometimes that just doesn't make sense because either they don't want to do it with their own time or they don't want to have a team and then have to worry about quality issues, management of people, all of that. All for what, right? So these guys have a huge ROI on lifestyle to income ratio. Um, so that's kind of like that model. Now, another example of somebody who is in, let me segment these out again. I got to figure out a better way to make these. I'm so bad at them. Um, but another example is let's say I was to do uh some version of this. Okay, so like my dream state cuz I want to use these a little bit. Um I don't want to sell anything. I don't want to build up an organic audience like I am right now and then push them where right like how how do I monetize this machine? So one of the things I could do is just do a community and I can either do that recurring one-time free whatever to put all the people in there. So, it's very very common for anybody in a lot of these niches to push people to a free group that would exist in school, um, wherever that they would, uh, you know, WhatsApp, uh, Telegram, and just have them inside this community, and they would have it gated. So, they would have $100 a month or something like that. So, they would have this recurring piece on the community, they would exist in here, and then they would upsell them either to an info product, that's the how-to. So, you essentially have just like the group and just access to the people. You then have the product and the info. A lot of the time these are bolted together, but let's say you had like an ascension one that was learn how to do XYZ, how to operate a machine that does 30 million a year, whatever it is. And then you'd sell this. Usually this is going to be more one-time unless it carries on and has continuing. The thing with info is if it's not continuation of education and it's not continuation of learnings and like constantly adjusting. It doesn't make sense to charge recurring. It only makes sense to charge one time because why is someone continuing to pay for college after they're out of college and they learn the thing, right? So that's there. And then the highest trunch would be coaching. And the coaching where I'm looking at it as is these pieces. So instead of doing coaching where your monetization model is this recurring whatever where you charge 50k for six months or whatever to get coaching from you, what you can do is like the true performance models where you take revshare where you take or profit share or equity. And depending on the business model, like for example, info coaching is extremely unlikely like 99.99% will never sell. So like equity doesn't even make sense like a lot of the time unless it turns into like a true true big big business. Um but revshare makes sense. Um profit share is a little bit harder but like depending on it may it may make sense. Thing with profit share is you a lot of time can't control expenses. Um you can't control what happens inside the business as somebody who's just like a consultant or a coach. Okay. So profit share let's just say revshare to keep it simple. So like my model that I could do and again I say I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything because I don't sell anything. People ask me for coaching, consulting, all this all the time and I say no to all of it and I'm just like happy to help. Um because my thing and my main thing that I'm focusing on is building our core business, right? I want to take this to uh you know that that be less than one year of our of our revenue and obviously that hasn't happened yet and that is the goal and the number one thing just a lot of leverage and team and everything built. So that's the goal but outside of that I'm so interested in this industry um and in info coaching in this space and the people and all that. that. So, it's like how would I model something where, you know, maybe there's a community aspect that's free, gated or something. Um, but then have I don't want to sell info. I don't want to sell. I don't want to sell. I don't want to sell. I just don't want to sell anything. I don't want anybody to give XYZ expectation or dollars then expect XYZ. That's not the goal of what I'm doing. Nor is it my main focus. But this is very interesting to me. Is there a way or a model to get uh percentage for coaching? So I can still have the time allocation of two hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, whatever a month with a business either in onetoone or one to group and then instead my monetization model instead of making the 50k or whatever it's you get a percentage of the rev in order to do so. So that's like another example and model and I just kind of selfishly use myself in there. Um but a lot of different ways to do this. Now another way that I see people do this is with affiliate. So I know people who have where is this? It is just info and then it is just where am I looking? Yeah, there we go. Just info and just coaching. So, they will use affiliates for their traffic source. Instead, they will push them to an info and community with coaching. Now, this is one time and it's just meant to get them in the door. So, they will use affiliates to sell something that is like $50 that is does info and then also has a community aspect. And the big thing with the community aspect is they use that to upsell into the coaching side of things. And the coaching side of things for them, um, yeah, there we go. coaching side of things is both recurring and partnerships. So, what what I mean by that is they will have a recurring six-month program that is I think let's call it 50 grand. Um, but it's around there. And they'll have this big big ticket thing that is recurring to be part of it, stay in it, and be in there, but then they'll also make a ton of money on these partnerships. So, an example of this is when I talk about uh if you watch other videos on the channel, I talk about like um life insurance and how it has this huge back end to where you can sell info coaching community right here. And then on the back end, you can just monetize like crazy with partnerships because it's in the financial space. So, they have uh estate attorneys they need, they have u money managers they need, they have like all these other things that you can either get paid a referral fee either as a one-time or as a percentage of the deal, which is kind of like more of like this. Um but there's a lot of different models like that. And I see that this one crushes. And this entire business uses affiliates instead of having to build up organic channels or pay for advertising. So they just give away 30% of the math of or it's actually higher, but it's like 60% of the math of what they uh generate over here. And then this business crushes all just from coaching. They could give away 300% over here because they make so much money on the back end through coaching and recurring and partnership. So I hope this was helpful. Um kind of just like bouncing around on this, but this is something I'm really really thinking about right now as we continue to do this in our main business. And then I kind of shop and figure out how I want to do my main thing. Um because my main thing I think I do want to do. I I like this industry too much. So I kind of want to do something like this. I think I think there's some cool partnerships I'd be able to do and then also make money here. Um I have a ton of people that I like really respect that do really good work that I would be happy to refer out. Um I think there's some business there. Same with some of the softwares and stuff. But I don't know. I want to stay in this land of just not selling anything. I don't want to go into, you know, info and this and that. like I just don't care and I don't need the money and do don't want the headache and the expectations. I just want to help uh people in the industry and make sure that we're all on the same page here and going up and to the right and build the one big business in the center. Um and do that through owning it, not through operating it. So I want to own it, not own or operate it. And that is to come. So hopefully I have some updates for you guys. Uh today is what day like 99 or something of this in a row. Um, I'm going to slow down and stop doing the daily updates here soon, but we've done every single day uh since the beginning uh in a row. So, I'm going to slow down. I have some cool stuff that I'm about to announce, I believe. Um, it's kind of in the works. We're we're going back and forth on some deal terms and some stuff, but uh there's some cool stuff in the works and overall I'm just going to keep making videos just a little bit more intermittently. I'll probably do like a one to three a week and I'll come up with a cadence and stick to that. Just these are really, really impactful, really, really deep on things that we're learning. um cool podcast or interviewer, whatever guests of like cool people I'm talking to in a really good structured cadence, maybe a little bit higher quality. Even though I do like these just like this, there's a there's a way to make it a little bit better for you guys. Um so that's kind of the goal. Um but yeah, hit me up. You guys know where to find the videos. www.rronclub.comdoc uh mindset sales ops marketing tech. I break them all down into here so you can look. The beginning of the videos were extremely focused on like the details of marketing and tech and systems and builds and then now has been as my evolution has occurred throughout this has been more around the or uh content, the personal brand, the operations of the business, the hiring of the people, the all of that because that's truly where my brain is traveling as we're going through this and I just share what's happening now. So, right now, this is what we're talking about. This is what I'm thinking about. So, that is what we talk about on here. All right. So, hit me up on uh Instagram links below in the comments. Comment on these. I think it's funny as when you guys comment funny stuff on these. Um, but yeah, I will uh I'll talk to you guys soon and appreciate it.

# $7M in 92 Days... here's my "boring" strategy | EP97
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-jN-YRaF9g

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing our boring strategy that made us $7 million in the last 92 days. We're going to walk through the three different marketing funnels we have and how they connect and the stats behind them. We're then going to walk through the three different sales sections we have, how those connect and the stats behind them, and then the three different fulfillment stacks we have and how those connect and the stats behind them. All right, I'm going to keep this very simple, but go into a lot of detail. All right, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed 76 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what didn't work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company, opportunities, and networking with cool people building cool All right, so first things first, Stripe screenshot to verify this through yesterday. So you can obviously see an uptrend here. We we'll have these down ticks uh on weekends and a lot of just I mean randomly honestly. Um but yeah, we're hovering around, you know, call it 100 to 150k a day over in these ranges back here. So, the three different funnels we have, I'm going to walk you through the actual flow of it, and then we'll get into the stats. So, the three main funnels we have are going to be a VSSL opt-in funnel, a direct application funnel, and a low ticket ascension funnel. Okay. So, for VSSL opt-in funnel, it's going to be your classic send uh Facebook or I'm sorry, meta or Google traffic to an opt-in page, and they're going to give us their name and email, and then watch uh to get a free training. The free training is going to be a VSSL page that has just the video on it. Um, and then the uh application, the click to the CTA on it is going to wait until in the VSSL when uh the call to action is in the actual video. Okay. So then it's going to pop up. There's a ton of emails and a ton of stuff around the back of this. I have other videos on the channel you can watch. You know, today's day 96 I think in a row of making these videos. I have a ton of videos that go in depth of automations and SMS and all these other crazy things. Um, but just for this uh quick overview, they will then go to an application. on the application there is a financial qualifier inside there that will route them either to the main booking page or the disqualified booking page. Okay, there's technically a disqualified bridge page and that is if the calendars are full. Okay, so on here if let's say we have zero availability for tomorrow and someone is DQed, they're going to get sent to this bridge page that will push them to this other funnel which I'll go into soon. Um but a majority of the time um you know most of the traffic is going to be qualified go here. Some of the traffic that's not is still going to be allowed to book. It's just going to go to um either ramping reps or uh lower quality reps. Okay. Um and then we do that just to cook the pixels and keep everything right there, right? So, they're going to book into here and then they're going to land on a success page where they're then going to talk to a closer and then be sold and, you know, purchase, get their terms, all that kind of stuff. Okay? So, that is going to be funnel number one. Now, the reason there are two right here is because we actually have two that are performing really well for us right now. We have our original funnel that we've done, you know, 71 or two million directly through. And then we have this other one um that has a different opt-in page in a different VSSL for a different messaging pocket. Okay? So, um you know, imagine something like um one of these, you know, drop ship guys, for example, like they have one that is around XYZ messaging and then one is around the other, but they're selling the same thing, right? It's the same product uh that they're selling over the phone. Um but they have different messaging funnels. Like one is about um branded drop ship, for example, and one is about uh US supply. Okay, let's just say this is as an example. So, different messaging pockets that have different uh language and messaging for these. Okay, now to go a little deeper into that, we actually have three more that are in the queue. This is our best funnel that we've had. The reason this is the best funnel for us is because we do so much around consumption and this has a lot of intent uh intention points versus something like this next funnel right here that I'll go into. But for us, this has worked really, really well for us because we have so much that exists within the email automations and campaign blast and content that exists for middle and bottom of funnel. Okay? So, we will email them non-stop, send them to the website. They exist in the flywheel of content or I'm sorry, a web of content that they will, you know, watch this one, then this one, then this one. Um, so that has worked really, really well for us. All right. Now, on the next funnel, we're going to have DTA. So, for us, DTA is direct to application. Some people call this direct to VSSL. Um, but for DTA, you're going to send the traffic directly to a page that's going to have a headline, a VSSL, and an application right on page. Some people delay this, um, which is pretty common, and then other people just make it instantly available. Either way, generally speaking, it is going to be a lower cost per app, lower as per uh uh lower cost per call um because it is easier and there's less friction, okay? Because you're sending them direct to this page and they can essentially just like instantly do it. Now, because of that, you'll have less consumption and you'll also have more people that bounce to that you can never other than just retarget to them because you didn't capture their email. The first capture point you have is the application. Okay? They're going to go through the same router and then go through the same back of funnel, okay? Where they can book uh either DQ or main or get bridged out uh if there is no availability on the calendars, which is actually pretty rare for us because we have so many reps and so much availability. Um and then this last one here is going to be our low ticket ascension funnel. So, this is going to be direct traffic to a front-end sales page. So, it's going to be a long form sales page where they basically put in name and email to start the checkout process. This is going to be a low ticket, something that's under $100. They're then going to land on the checkout page. Once they land on the checkout page, it's the full, you know, purchase. They will purchase and then the big difference here from a lot of people what they do with low ticket and why I'm calling it, you know, ascension more so is because as soon as they purchase, they get pushed to um book an onboarding call. So it's basically onboarding, quick start, implementation, whatever you want to call it. They will then book into this and get on with a setter. Okay. So we have run this in the past where they go direct to closers and it has been very messy where a closer has you know this someone with this framing and expectation that lands here versus someone with this that's you know booking an implementation or quick start or whatever. Um so we did layer in a setter in between and this has been crushing for us. Okay. So they will directly book in with a setter. Uh and I'll go through the stats on all of these in a minute. Then once they're on the setter, they'll get set with a closer, all the uh intentions there, the framing, the qualification, everything. And then they get on with the closer and close. Okay. We do also have this uh page right here, which is postbooking. They will get asked to submit a questionnaire. It is not required. And uh we do see that people who fill that out have a higher likelihood of them being set or closed. Um but again, that's just kind of like an optional piece. So those are the three core funnels and that's how they connect. Now again, we have multiple variations of this and just as like a kind of future pacing. So over the last 92, right, what we've done is essentially lean into both of these because we were running just one main on here. We've optimized this out where we had three different ones that we were testing. We've now landed on one that's like mainly working for us. And then this has like 92 different split tests and variations. It's constantly up and down for us. And we're actually trying to solve for this in a very different way. Um where we're trying to make it more cold friendly so we can run this at mass scale. um versus right now call it I don't want to give exact numbers but call it you know 50 call it 100 whatever units a day and we're looking for something we can sell hundreds of units a day on okay so right now all of these get traffic all of these get spend and then they all work interchangeable and what our CMO calls the VVS the value vortex system okay now stats on this just quick I'm just going to pop over here because I have all my stats up over here um but we're going to say on across this range we had around 75,000 leads, call it. Uh we had around 20,000 applications that come through all of these different buckets. And then we had um around 12,000 calls, 11,000 12,000 calls. Okay, we'll just use that as a number. So from that, again, consumption is going to be biggest here. And if I pop out, I have a funnel economics sheet that kind of breaks all these down. But the app to call percentage, so is going to or how do I let me back up a little bit. So for the opt-ins of these people that are going to come to here, we have a pretty high rate actually that go from lead to application. This one is direct application. So obviously there's no data for this one and this one kind of doesn't count for that. Um but we have a pretty high like multiple tens percentage that go from lead to app. And on this we're optimizing for schedule and purchase. It's kind of like a throttling between the two. Um on this same thing and on this it's just optimizing for the purchase. And as they flow through here, we've seen that like a very very high percentage of people are touching multiple points of these. Okay? So they will come into here, then they will exist in this system, be getting a ton of email, see an ad, and then get into this one and then route into these. And then same with this. This will kind of pick up people. Um the almost issue with this that we've had thus far is that uh almost all, not almost all, but like call it 50% of the purchases that'll come through here are already existing in our CRM. Um we have years and years and years of people in the CRM. So it's not to say it was like you know yesterday they saw this and then they purchased this. Um there are some of those but a lot of them are people who have existed in the system haven't bought something from us and then book into these. Okay so getting into this next portion setters. So setters will have auto confirmed and self set. Okay these also have different commission tranches for those of you that operate. Um but essentially an auto set is going to be considered one of these calls. Okay. So where we are automatically putting a booking on their calendar. These are 15-minute Zoom calls that we'll set with them. Okay, so that's an auto set. A confirmed set is basically them claiming these. Okay, so the ones that come direct through marketing or what basically everything that's not a set um that is auto on their calendar or a self-s set is going to be considered a confirm set. So a lot of people call these marketing bookings. Um they're technically everything bookings. Um but those are what exist here and they will call and they'll call within whatever 3 minutes. They will confirm, hey, you know, this is XYZ time zone, you know, is a Zoom call, you know, XYZ, all these different things. Okay. Um, so that's the confirm set, which is essentially just like a triage or confirmation. And then a self set is going to be everything that exists where there's a phone number. So let for a simple example, application not booked. So somebody that falls off in here. So they apply but they don't book, which on average for us is call it 40% of the applications on day. So if we got 100 applications, 60 of them are going to book on their own and 40% are going to fall through the cracks. And that is one of bucket one, let's say, that the selfset's going to hit. We also have them from this phase that apply that do DTA but don't book. Then from there you're going to have I mean there's like 90 different versions of these but then you're going to have people who don't show for the call. You're going to have people who don't show for the set call. You're going to have people who purchase the low ticket but don't book into this call. You're going to call that 30 40% that don't book on this. So same thing if you have 100 people that purchase the low ticket. You're going to have 60 or 70 that'll book um if you're crushing it and then you're going to have you know 30 40 that fall through the cracks. So all of these are going to have automations that exist, but they're also going to be layered in with setters. So we have AI bots that message in between these um and then also push them back to the setters. So that is kind of setter land, right? Um and I'm trying to think if there's any other direct buckets, but it's basically that and then pushing backwards. We also have something on booking page that has it. So if there's no times on the calendar that works for the person, they can submit a form uh of when the when when a good time for them is and the uh setters get those and they will reach out to those and those are considered self sets as well. All right. Now closers closers are just going to exist over here. I almost built this out to be like massive and show you the different things, but essentially uh calls are all going to come into the CRM as call scheduled and then there's, you know, nine different ways that they can go. So, they can either be a no-show, a cancel, um a complete DQ, like there's just no way. Um closed one, closed lost, hot listing, uh long/midterm, uh nurture. So, there's a bunch of different things that exist within here, but the closers are just working their pipeline. They're getting full booked. We just now changed this on around here, as you can see, like a the downturn. Um we changed it over to be 45minute booking slots, and this whole time it's been 30 forever. So, a lot of just 30 back to back to back to back to back. But the issue is a majority of the closes exist outside of that 30 minute range. Um, so we're trying to optimize for making the calls long enough but also understanding that show rate is a real thing and having backto-back calls where there's no shows uh off like just you know breaks the frame and breaks the role there. Um so retention I kind of want to come back to this as it exists for these fulfillment. Um but a retention exists over here you know right? So that is after they've already gone through the program and product um and when there's inflection and main points they will then uh you know retain them or uh or get them into the next year or multiple years. Okay. So fulfillment stack so info and community and I have a whole chart on this. I'm going to make an entire video of how I view fulfillment or product offerings. Um everything from onetoone with the expert all the way down to the very bottom which is essentially just info just as it is without a community. um and how the different value stacks, how you can charge different prices. Um but for us right now in this stack that you're seeing here, info plus community is going to exist right here. So this is going to be a sub $100 product that they get info. Okay? So they're getting login access to something. They're learning XYZ thing, one specific like module or many multi uh many modules that back out of essentially the coaching. And for us, we're going to sell that for sub $100 and then they also get access to a group. Okay. So for us, we do our Facebook groups in uh I'm sorry, we do our groups in Facebook. A lot of people use school, whatever. Our demo is majority or SC or circle or some of these other ones. Um our demo is majority on Facebook uh just for who they are. So we keep the group on there. So that'll exist there. Onetoone coaching is this main offering. So everything that we're going to sell on this initial sales call is only onetoone coaching. We have one offering, multiple pay plans, uh financing, sure, all that kind of stuff. Um but it is one offer. Okay? And the reason I say less margin is in comparison to group coaching. Uh, and I have again I have other videos where I break this down, but on the initial stack for when you're selling this, you have you have to think about what goes into the cost to fulfill this as well as the cost to, you know, acquire a customer. So the acquisition piece, you're going to have your marketing spend, you're going to have your sales commissions, you're going to have setter commissions, you're going to have management, you're going to have all those different pieces that exist there. You're going to have your entire ad spend bucket plus marketing department bucket. Um, and again, you can kind of pick where you choose where these sit on the P&L if these are supposed to be lower or above. But directly to acquire a customer, you need to pay a sales rep, a setter, you need to uh pay your ad spend, and then you need to pay for the fulfillment of this. So, you're going to pay a coach. And in a onetoone setting, it is likely going to cost you more than it is going to cost in a group setting because one coach can only work with X amount of people. So, you're going to take that coach's salary or amount or whatever, and then however many clients they have across the year, and that's going to be your per unit cost that it's going to cost you to fulfill on this. Okay? So we are going to have less margin on this just because of that stack and where all the real money is made is going to be in this retention portion. All right. So retention is going to exist for us is something we are constantly um or just newly but now going to be constantly adjusting um to where we can refine this because we had a leaky bucket for a long time. Um we really should have focused on this earlier and we didn't. Um and in doing so we let a lot of money slip through the cracks where we paid a lot to acquire a customer. We got them in we got them results. we fulfilled on the contract which was the year but we didn't frame it in a way that then was this is a continuation this is a forever thing um and they should get another year of coaching or we didn't have any other offerings okay so that was the thing that we just offer we just rolled out so beginning of this month we rolled out a group coaching style thing that's essentially you come in you join in onetoone coaching right so you have onetoone coaching that is the personalization that is everything you need to get you from you know basically existing in no man's land to being on structure and getting in you know in xyz result. Um, but then after that one year, your offerings that you now can get through the retention team is essentially keep staying onetoone coaching either with your current coach or a different coach. So stay on that one to one or we now have you can go multiple years for a discounted per year rate. So if you want to go, okay, cool. I want another three years, two years, whatever, you can do that at a discounted rate. So pushes the cash forward, locks them in for multiple years, which is great because honestly a lot of these women uh in our demo and our target like they do need to be in for multiple years in order to kind of like fully sustain and set in. Um and just have the personalization, the accountability, the onetoone that piece. Okay. Now, if it is too big of a, you know, cash burden or whatever, um but they still want to stay for the community, a bit of personalization, the access to the app, the all those things, we didn't have an offering for that. Okay. So now we've rolled out group coaching that allows us to have um less cost per to pay a coach, right? Because they're going to have multiple there's no one to one, right? So there's no direct messaging, there's no onetoone calls, there's none of that piece. So the fulfillment is lesser um but the person still gets access to all of those things they want to stay for. So they get access to the community, they get access to the app, they get access to the workout, they get access to all these different pieces um for a lower cost. So for us is actually half the cost. So let's say this is 10,000, this is actually 5,000, right? So it's half the cost uh for the year. And we also have monthly options, different pay plans. Now, I think this is going to crush for us. And it is really framed as like the lifer program. Like you're just in this for life. Um because you get to stay and get all access to that. And you also get the group coaching aspect. So when you do need help um you can come into here and still get the personalization. It's just in a group setting instead of getting on onetoone. All right. So that's kind of the stack for us. Um and the um the stats kind of behind that. I'm going to do like a full video where I go through like all the literal nitty- nitty-gritty. Um, but I have I I pulled them up over here just to kind of give you some like rough ones off the rip. So for the Let's go up back up to the top. So for us, uh, what is really good here, let's start with setters. Um, on setters on here. So the different buckets of auto set. So auto set is our highest stats. So auto stats will have 80 to 90% show rates, which is like crazy in our world. Um, so 80 to 90% show rates once they get to the closer. So once they exist between here and here, we'll have an 80 to 90% show rate and call it a 22 25% live call close. So the economics on this crush, the issue for us right now is solving for getting this cost per purchase lower. Okay? Because of how it's framed and because how it's set up, it's not cold friendly. So it is not um producing at the rates that we want it or uh or we're not getting the net CPA that we want uh on this. So we can't scale into it. Okay. Okay, so that is something that exists right here as an issue, but all of the stats on this are fantastic. Okay, so the current bottleneck on this is solving for here. Okay, so that's what we're working on now. Um, there's also other things on here that we're solving for that kind of feed into this a little. Um, but if we were to isolate this, that's that one right there. Okay, now confirm sets. These ones are landing at around a 75% which is amazing. So 75% show rate and a very solid live call close. And now the thing for us here is the percentage of confirmed books. Okay? So like let's say you have 100 bookings on day for us in current state only half of them roughly will be confirmed. So while these ones have a fantastic show rate, the ones that don't confirm um either need to be set as free and then they can get double booked on the calendar uh or they need to be reached out to multiple times. But it's an issue that we're having where the solve for this right now is trying to get a higher percentage of the bookings confirmed because once they are confirmed um then the stats right here are amazing. Okay. So bottleneck on this one is getting more confirmed. Self set interestingly enough this is the lowest show rate we have. So this is people they're hitting that are in this uh app notebook or some of these other zones and buckets. Um and for us it's just um you're basically getting more bookings for the same amount of spend. Right? So you do obviously then layer in the cost of having a setter. But this is your dial 100 get, you know, five pickups, set one, whatever math. Um, and this is uh something we need to work on, right? We need better dials. So that the bottleneck on this one in current state is basically getting more uh more sets for the amount of leads that we have. So which is increasing the dial rate, which is better framing on the calls, which is, you know, better connection rate, all those things. So we're looking at different softwares and ways um that we can manage this team in a better way to get more sets that come from the setters um like directly the self sets. Okay, closers. Um this one we are optimizing for right now as the bottleneck on this right now is the live call close and that is an issue with where we're having missed opportunities. The call length wasn't good, the admin amount, the the follow-up time, the abil the even time to have the follow-up because of how packed their days were, all those kind of pieces. So that's why we just attempt where there's the attempt number one is to move them from 30 to 45 minute bookings. So that is you know proactive solve number one we're trying for this bottleneck and then retention. So retention team their bottleneck right now is mainly the frame in which people are getting onto these calls and the time of it. So for us this is new to us where we're trying to like force book these calls for retention. We're doing it 60 days before the end of the term and I think what we need to do is probably layer in more activation points. So, we're doing an entire like data overhaul that stores all this stuff and has like uh activation points or like peak points of like their happiness and their like success in the program so that we can, you know, basically reach out and have conversations with them on the peak moments. Um, but for us right now, the other piece of this is the framing that exists within the coaching and how they were sold uh is really on this one-year contract, one-year contract. Um and then multiple people have been sold on uh for like last year uh were sold into 24-month payment plans either through credit card through whatever different ways. Uh and that is massively hurting retention because they come up to the completion of you know the program set and because of how they chose to finance it or because of how it was pitched to finance it externally um they still have payments for the next year. So it's very very low low likelihood that they will retain. Um so we're doing different things here. We're also talking about doing different offerings that would make it so this makes more sense. Um, but yeah, so that's kind of the the pinches on these. Within marketing itself, we are testing multiple new VSSL opt-in funnels, and I think these are going to crush for us. We have different brand faces that we're going to be testing. This DTA is not getting really any love right now, but we're testing doing some like delayed button pops. Um, so there is forced consumption for call it 5 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever um before they are even able to apply. So seeing kind of where those stats shake out. Um, but this almost again acts as like a not purposeful but like retargeting asset. and so does this. So really, this is like the core core core. So that's why we're optimizing on these right now inside of fulfillment, the uh info coach, the info plus community. This is going to be likely rebuilt as a new product that we can have. It's not just framing it differently. It's going to be building out a completely new uh complete new product stack um that we can use for cold for low ticket. Um the one-on-one coaching is crushing for us. Uh they get crazy crazy results, which is like, you know, honestly the most important part. Um, but we just need to get the math to be a little bit dialed in a little better. And then this group coaching piece is brand new to us. So, fulfillment is new to us as well as kind of the offering. So, we're just navigating that. So, hopefully that was helpful. Um, I can go into other videos where I go like deep deep into the stats on like percents across these. Um, but I feel like I just gave you a lot of them. Um, but yeah, so this is what our focus is. This is how we did. And really the boring strategy is essentially just more of the same. So, we're just doing more of the same, just iteration, optimization, and more of the same. So get something that's at 10% and get it up to 14% and then do more volume. Um really is what this is. It's not a simple this is a simple business model. Um very simple business model. So it's kind of boring sometimes just to you know keep iterating the same stuff but that's the point, right? That's the point. So building it into a machine that's consistent that continues to build. So hopefully that was valuable for you guys. Today's day 95 or 96 I believe in a row of making these videos. Uh you can find them all at www.ryclog.comdoc. ryanclog.comdoc. I break them down tech, marketing, sales ops. In the beginning, I was very very heavy into like deep nitty-gritty of what we were doing, how we were doing it, um review everything from funnel setups to um sales uh sales comp trackers to how we even do the comp um stuff like that. So, there's a ton of detail uh in a lot of these videos. So, if you want to go binge, be happy to. So, all right. Um that's what I got today. So, hit me up on Instagram if you have any questions. Uh is the best place to find me. Uh, comment below. I love the comments. They're funny as sometimes. So, hit me up there and I will talk to you guys soon.

# $4M+ SEO Masterclass Explained in 58 Minutes (Jacky Chou) | EP96
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8hF1KdcZeE

What's up, guys? In today's video, we have a banger. We have Jackie Cow, Indexy, King of SEO, all the things. Jackie, tell the people what you're all about. Yo, uh Ryan, thanks for having me on. Uh but yeah, quick intro. Name's Jackie Chow. Do a lot of SEO. um got started in ecom actually and found my way to SEO mostly because e ecom your pain tolerance needs to be super high. I don't know if anyone's doing private labeling. It's disgusting. Um still doing it. Um probably won't do that ever again. So yeah, and I'm a huge victim of shiny object syndrome. So I've done everything and anything under the sun. Uh but yeah, excited to come on here, share my knowledge. probably and probably learn a ton of things from you on the info side as well. Yeah. Yeah. No, so my background with you is I have a buddy that I talk about here on all the time that does like random affiliate side stuff and he put me on to your when you were probably 60 70 days in to your like building in public. Um, and I got on that, got a software or like a plugin that would flip it and I listened to every single one through like 1 through 70 in a row. So like I got like super caught up to date with all of your stuff when I was living in PR. I just threw it up on a screen over here and just like would work and just listen to all of them over and over and over again. So, I got super familiar with all your stuff. Um, and yeah, so it's it's it's cool. It's like definitely out of my frame and my game, but I have a like vegan blog that I made for my mom that made like, you know, upwards of 5K a month when things were humming and good just from display ads. And then now it's like, you know, 2K a month or something with where everything for search for hers is going. But yeah, man, super familiar with that whole game. And then you obviously you do a ton of stuff around sharing, right? like you're you share the net worth update stuff. You have the what is it like a is it newsletter style? I don't remember where I saw it. If it's newsletter or tweets or whatever the month over month. Yeah. So I do um monthly revenue updates on X and then I do net worth updates via the newsletter. Um and yeah, that's that's probably my most popular newsletter um like of the month. And I do like maybe 12 a month and that is by far the most popular. Everyone signed on for that. Um yeah. Yeah. Cuz like I I think I don't know about your industry, but in the SEO space, people out here are not transparent at all. You wouldn't know like what their bottom line is, uh what kind of like net worth they would have. Everyone's just sharing screenshots of like topline revenue most of the time. So I thought I'd like flip the script, try that. and it's it's going relatively well, but I'm like I don't know if you follow You said you did follow the daily episodes. I'm like 500 something in. Yeah. I'm only at like 20K subs. Something's something's got I got I probably got to do something about that. But um yeah, we'll see. Yeah, but you have the depth, right? Like you have the the people who consume consume like your comments are hilarious and like you have the people who like, you know, essentially it's like daily vlog, right? Like they feel so close to you and they understand you or what you're up to. And so there's leverage in that if you can you if if there's use in it, right? If you want to use it. And I talked to someone about this the other day that was like, what's the goal? What's the goal? And like I have opportunities flying left and right. I hit the goal. The goal was 3 to 5K that are like in the space. It was to be able to access network and talent and things and like hit that pretty quick. And now it's like what's the new goal? And it's like is it cash flow? Is it like clout at some level? Is it like opportunity? You know, what is it? So I'm still navigating that. But um yeah, I mean I I love your stuff and I think the So like what's the current uh cuz I've seen some you've had some crazy stuff. You've had like the pump fund style fund thing that happened, right? Like you've had the um you have the service style agency, you have your whole portfolio, you have software, remember at one point like the republish thing. Like what's your current stack on what you're running? Um I I got a bunch of stuff. Hold on. Let me pull it up real quick. else. Um, last month, highest revenue was my local SEO software, which is like popping off. I don't know if you're following that. That that's kind of crazy. That was um out of left field for me. I was not expecting uh that kind of revenue. We did 34K last month on that. We launched like a month and a half ago, something like that. Um, that was a huge surprise. I do like 30K on OAF revenue which is just display ads type of thing. Um we go through a network and I drive a ton of revenue on the O of side agency. We got the private community of local SEOs. So that that is like kind of my first taste of success via the uh YouTube channel. So, it kind of proved out doing daily YouTube videos is worth it despite my low numbers cuz like a huge percentage of those people will convert to um a private community member cuz they feel so close to you and they trust you. So on so forth. Yeah. Stuff like that. Um I think yeah agency of software Amazon affiliate that's about it. Um that's about it. Yeah, but I'm I'm I'm down big, man. I'm down big. I don't know how long you've been following me for, but um I think year on year I'm down like 50%. It's rough out here for SEO. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, the my micro example is the blog, the vegan blog or whatever, and she doesn't do any of that stuff, right? Like it's just it just is what it is, but like from where it was, it's down 60 70%. So, I saw you do put an X thing on that was like all of them got group clapped or something like in your GSC or what what happened with that? Was that Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, so like a year ago they came after me like personally Google. Um, they went through my like anything that's connected to me and they just completely clapped all the assets on those accounts. Um, yeah, that was rough and but it is what it is. I mean I I game the algo for a living, right? So it's bound to happen. I'm definitely not doing things like straight. Um, so yeah, it's fine. It's fine. I don't know if you followed, but um the uh partnership stuff was crazy. That was like the most insane high of my life. When you uh so to give your audience a bit of uh background, what we did was we partnered up with like legacy media partners. We carved out an affiliate site for their website. For example, let's see, say you're like local newspaper like the Vancouverson.com. They have like huge super strong domain authority and we they're but but they're dying as a business. So, we'd approach them and be like, "Yo, um, are you guys down to post like supplement articles, OAF articles?" And we'd monetize like hard. And they'd fly straight to number one and we're able to like fill in the pockets for um uh we call that like paid uh sponsored rank and rents where we'd rank for something like best protein powder and we'd reach out to protein powder uh companies and they'd pay a flat plus percentage to be listed at number one. And those numbers were insane. I think the highest we've ever gotten for number one placement was like 50k per month plus 50% commission. Uh but those like those keywords were insane. Uh anyone in the supplement industry knows how competitive it is. Yeah. Interesting. So is that part of any of the the current numbers or is that like like what's Yeah, it's it's Yeah. the so that those the highest number I've ever gotten like per month was like 550k per month um in affiliate file stuff. But now it's it's it's dead. It's well it's pretty much dead. It's at like calculate it's 16 like 17k per month. Wow. Um it's rough out here, man. That's why I think in the SEO space you gota you got to pivot so fast. Um yeah. Yeah. I asked uh I asked some people like what they wanted to hear and one of the ones the main ones that stood out to me and I'll pull up all of them but one of the main ones that stood out to me is someone was asking uh like uh LLM SEO and that's funny and we just talked about this in like an info coaching we have like a small group that we talk or I don't have a small group I mean I got invited to a small group of people that are info coaching people and uh last week we were just breaking that down like how do you show up for whatever keyword and like right now most of us that are big enough do show up for our unbranded keyword um or key like whatever search, but not for women over 40 weight loss or like tips for women over 40. Like how do we get shown for that? So, do you guys do any of that stuff yet? I don't like offering stuff I'm not like confident in. I have to say with like a super high uh certainty cuz um yeah, so I'm I'm testing. I don't want to speak too soon, but if if I want to point people in the right direction, I think um a lot of Reddit stuff, a lot of Kora stuff, um you can and it's super easy to manipulate. I don't know if you guys are looking into that at all. You guys should probably do it tomorrow. So, what I would do, I don't know, let's give a info example. I don't know, best FBA courses right now 2025. All right, I'd Google that. probably a Reddit subreddit uh Reddit po Reddit post would come up on Google and I'd list my own course there via a proxy account and then upvote that massively by a ton of up votes and then send a ton of like fake comments adding on to that and if you appear on those type of uh Reddit posts you start showing up in the LLM. Uh, I think A16Z is starting to call it like GIO, so I guess we'll stick with that. But, um, that's they get to pick name things. Yeah, exactly. We're just making [ __ ] up at this point. But, um, yeah, I think that that's that's what people are saying is working. We're running to like a lot of tests at the same time, but it's not conclusive yet. So, I can't say for certain, but that's probably the direction I would point people towards. Yeah. For us in info coaching, like the the rule of thumb is like look at your Reddit threads. Once you're like if your show rates tank, it's like look at your Reddit threads. That's like a big thing, especially for the make money online guys because people start a thread that and it's it pops up for branded search and then as soon as you're right there, it's why it sucks. It's all the, you know, naysayers and then people that have already booked look you up and then they sit in that in between land and then they never show for the call. So like Jeremy Haynes talks about that a lot, but that's like the number one place that we see it is like as a direct KPI. Um, and then I'll even see it in like we have an automated bot between application and booking. So, applied or started the process but never even booked. And they'll message back and be like, oh no, I looked it up online and it's like and it's too expensive. And it's like where do they find it? Like we don't have it posted. And then you know you kind of look around like we rank right now for a Reddit thread that's not even about us and is not have it doesn't even have our name in the content. Nowhere on the page and and it ranks for us. It's like crazy. So yeah, that's interesting. the the the large the large language model one I think would be a big win over time because the amount of people that are now using it for search directly like I use it 80 90% of the time so that Yeah. Me too. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Um Yeah. Yeah. I think real quick for the Reddit stuff I don't think people realize how easy it is to game right now and how cheap it is. It's like five cents per up vote or something like that and you can get farmed accounts for like dollars at a time and you can manipulate anything on Reddit at this point. So, I don't know if you saw the uh news article that came out on Reddit, but you can even bribe mods on the subreddits that you're on and it wouldn't cost that much cuz these guys are like broke neck beards in like their mom's basement. It would cost like a,000 bucks and then you own that subreddit essentially. So you can you're done, you know, for a thousand bucks. How that's like a drop in the bucket for most of us. So then then you can control just about any narrative you want in that space, at least in your space. Uh it won't work in high competition niches like supplements or VPN or mattresses. But yeah, it's uh I think there's something there. Um at least definitely in your industry. But um yeah, I wonder if we even had like something cuz like in my head I'm like, "Okay, who can I just pay to like handle or understand that?" And I wonder if I'm sure there's an industry or a service or gap there because I know people who do like removal services and all that, but not like the other, right? It's like we only do it like reactively. If there's an issue, we you know, pull down versus proactively like build it out so it's in pro of you. Um, but that would be an interesting as a service because there's a lot of guys in like the info coaching MMO or whatever that it would probably do them really really well if they had something that was number one ranking on there or you know the number one ranking at least on the top Reddit or at for Reddit uh that was why it's amazing and like all these results these people got and all that kind of stuff versus oh this thing sucks or oh here's the cost of it or oh whatever which it is what it currently is. So that that would be an interesting model. Yeah. How much are you um how much you guys is paying for removals? Um not much. We We actually Is there like hundreds or thousands? Uh we had one issue with one that was not about us that was like a fake that we paid like high hundreds for. Okay. Okay. But we've never really had big issues with that. I've had issues with that of other people I've talked to or like been working with and they have paid like thousands and thousands and they've also had like bigger ones that are like full Google removal ones that they try and do. Um but I don't know. I don't know enough about that game, but like there's bigger players that have just constant like monthly just these things that I don't know. I just stay away from like we we've been pretty knock on wood like all good there. So, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've always been fascinated with your um the info and coaching niche. I was like, we're thinking if there's a way to spin it for our the uh local rank business, which is the local SEO software, where it's like we offer some sort of info coaching, but we run it at break even, so people use our software, if that makes sense. I don't know if you saw what the list kit guys are doing. That that's kind of crazy. So, I was thinking of doing something similar. Um, yeah, it's very it's very very common to do. Oh, it's super common. Like that's not even their main business. their main business like software in the background. Yeah, most of them fail to be honest. So, because they like bounce back and forth and they're not like focused on either one, it's like the info coaching either is like breaking even, barely making money, losing, it just kind of like bounces and then the software never gets the attention it needs to be like a product that can stand alone. So, like it doesn't fully work. But if you're doing it like lean model, like I had uh Brook Hiddink on here for example, and he talks about how they have theirs is all about uh like brand it's uh what's it's like US-based uh high ticket drop shipping essentially and he sells a course. They run it to a webinar funnel. They sell a 1 to 2k direct toart thing where they make money on the spread between ads and that purchase and then right there they upsell them to like build a full store for them or do whatever. And it's like a 10 to 25k ticket I think is the numbers. Um, so he'll upgrade them to that and then once you're in there it's like oh yeah and then sign up for the software to like you know basically find the suppliers and they own the software. So like even if Right. So like they'll they'll make money full like the majority of their money is info coaching like lives in that land but then they also make money on the software. Um Becker did it for Hyros like Oh do. Yeahro he Trojan horse the [ __ ] out of it. He um I mean way way back when it was like you know zaps and all this kind of stuff and just kind of sniping people. Um, but then he sold uh iron mastermind I think was the name of it. And I bought it. We were in there and it was like five grand. You get in and it was all about YouTube ads, how to make the VSSL, how to like structure a lean mean product and then like how to be, you know, mind, body, soul, like your individual self. And then as soon as you got in there, he was like, "But you got you should joy us. Like everyone needs to join Hyros." And then there's only however many hundreds I think probably of people in there max. But it was the whales. So like all the whales ended up using it. And then he barely did any time on the group coaching. It was a pre-recorded course and like a once a week call and then he just built Hyros and then he just shut it down on the front and then just kept the community for a while and then just built Hyros built Hyros and like but yeah that's the biggest difference is a lot of people don't make it stand alone like it couldn't stand alone like if it had if it had to do its own acquisition in any capacity that wasn't info coaching then they usually die something along the lines of like oh yeah you know like it makes six figures like all good and I honestly don't know if he's talking monthly or annual you never know with that guy so it doing either um in your industry. Sorry, I'm just like I'm hounding you at this point, but No, no, this is just open forum. We talk questions, you whatever. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Um in in your industry cuz some of these numbers I I I took a look at your YouTube channel like couple times this week coming up uh approaching this call. Some of the numbers are insane. Are these what what kind of profit margin are do people typically see in this industry? That that's crazy. Some of these numbers are insane, dude. I feel like a peasant. They're nuts. Why? Why am I here, you know? Yeah. I feel like I feel like for this my corner I feel like a peasant in my corner of info coaching, too. So, like, all right. So, I just got back from Iman's event in London yesterday. And uh the room and the iman structure of info coaching is there's like kind of like two. It's like and the simplest way to differentiate is like organic versus paid are kind of like the two is the big one. And then info coaching the idea being info is just like login access and like usually some hybrid thing with calls and then coaching is either like onetoone group coach something in that model right so he is like the king of doing this organic and info yes there's coaching but like not the level of coaching we generally talk about and then he also then leverages global talent which I'm sure you do as well but like that's not something we do. So like ours is paid. It's evergreen. It's onetoone coaching. So there's not like big launches when I say evergreen. Um so paid to evergreen to onetoone coaching. So higher costs and then all you know US and W2. So you add those all up and it's like my P&L is like and then you take his and you don't have to deduct any of that. And he's like 80% margins. William Brown was on there. He's making half a million bucks a month right now with 84% margins or something. Gez. Wait, they don't run paid? they so he just now I imman was talking about he just now ran paid for like the most recent event but majority of their stuff is not paid at all and even if it is it breaks either like you know he'll spend x amount make x amount back on registrations but they did you know I don't know how big his number but he talked about it they did you know eight figures in the launch that's crazy that's crazy the wrong industry man but there are so many people in the room that had his model more so so they have organic they take organic they push either to low, mid, and then right up to high, right, is basically kind of like the thing. And then majority of them have worldwide talent and whatever else. So, it is very common in that room to be 50 plus% and probably like 70 plus% and they're doing hundreds of thousands a month. Everyone, everyone in that room. Crazy. Yeah, there's some beginners. Okay, that's not fair. There's some beginners and stuff, but like, dude, it was it's very interesting. And they all run that model. Iman's kind of the only one who's really doing like the hardcore events uh like consistently like that. Like, he has a machine built around it. Um, but there were guys in the room that, you know, spend I'm trying to remember the exact numbers. I don't want to botch this, but it was basically over it was a 10x uh rorowaz spent whatever he spent close to 100 grand on this launch. Sold a 5k ticket on the end of an event and made like 1.5 million like made like 15x and yeah, so it's an interesting game. Uh, the big thing is the that LTV to CAC, right? Is the LTV to CAC. if you can make more money after you acquire them. How long do they stay in the system? Is there retention? Is there recurring? There's guys that run a very identical business model uh in terms of like paid evergreen through a VSSL call funnel, buy a high ticket thing and then it's performed through like a course and basically group coaching style or onetoone coaching style but their ticket is like 25k and ours is like you know a little under 10k and they have retention that's crazy cuz it's like you know it's the cool kids club it's the boys club and their math is like insanity. Same thing with them. It's like they they lose 30% on their margin because they, you know, 3x row as call it because they spend and it's all paid. But then they have all those other pieces. So they'll do 40% margins, 50% margins and they'll do 30 million last year. So it's like and what what sorry I'm kind of new to this, but what exactly are they typically selling in terms of like what are they giving? Yeah. So let's build one in your example. So it's like okay, so like what I've seen about yours there is in that example for what they're doing is they're teaching like uh cryp theirs is crypto education is what their specific one is. Ours is women's fitness. Oh, I think I've heard of those guys then. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And they're and they're cool. And Tan was on here. So Tanger was on here and he's the guy I'm talking about, but they like crush. Um but for your model cuz you're right now what you're selling the community. It's like some low ticket monthly recurring. Uh so there's two things. There's one community that's doing pretty well does like at its peak probably 100K per month. Right now it's at sat at like 30 something per month. Um and it's what like it's literally just a slack channel and then like a a course and people love being in there. It's kind of like the cool kids club in the SEO space. Um people are more open to sharing in there. Yeah. It's pretty savage in there. Yeah. Like the people [ __ ] they talk about. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's amazing. So like yeah that's the info coaching business right is like that. So that would be considered oh I see. Yeah. So that that's how we would look at it is like okay so that's info coaching. Now that example of like they join and the first thing they join is that a lot of these trading communities are similar to that. So they'll join and it's like they get access to the how-tos and the whatever and it's just done for them. They pop in there and it's $50 a month $100 a month $300 a month whatever and they just sit on recurring. So you have this big MR engine and then where those guys monetize it on the back is like the education is on the back. So, it'll be 5K, 10K, whatever. Inside your Slack, you'll have one thing that's like get more access or like work one-on-one with you or work one-on-one with your seuite or your operations team or whatever. And you pay 10 grand and then you're going to, you know, fasttrack essentially to do that. And then that those two combined, this all of a sudden starts to make up a massive amount as a percentage of revenue because even though it's like way smaller units because of the spread. So, instead, you change that to whatever dollar value month. um it's gated and then there's either different tiers or different levels of implementation is the big one. So, like you're trying to teach them all how to get XYZ result in SEO and now there's just a login access, do-it-yourself, figure it out, navigate the community, and then the implementation is like, "No, I get to work one-on-one with Jackie." And it's like, "Oh, that's 50 grand." And then it's like, "Oh, I get to work with Jackie's team, that's 25 grand." Or, "I get to get on a group coaching call with Jackie. Oh, that's five grand." And like, it's that tier is usually how it would be to do it. And um my buddy who did the FBA courses, he said to have closers. Is that is that common? Like you have some dude like some killer who just hops on. It's like, "Yo, push them along." Like that that type. It's very common. It's a little different sometimes with the when they're inside already. So with yours, we call that like an ascension funnel usually. So like they join through one thing, you just pump every, you know, the most common way would be you have all your YouTube stuff. It's long form, people feel like they know you and you just fire them off either into a free group or a very like a low ticket paid group. Once they're inside there, then they join. They ascend. So, you have different activation points. You have different, you know, people strer someone that lives in there that like snipes the people to have these other offers. And then usually if it's anything over like $2,000, you want to talk to them on the phone. There's guys who crush it and send like 10k payment links and whatever, but that's kind of like a little less normal and definitely not normal for cold. So, like same way. So, like ours is like a VSS. We have different uh opt-in funnels, but essentially they'll watch VSLs, do this, they apply, and then book a call and they talk to a closer before because anything over twoish thousand, you generally are not going to sell like direct to cart like someone just buys it on their own. So a 10k offer, 25k offer, whatever, they want to talk to someone and then they just like, you know, help them understand why they aren't doing it on their own already. You already have access to all the information. You can do this on your own. Why haven't you gotten the result? And it's like, oh, because I need the personalization. I need the handholding. I need the accountability. I need the whatever. And it's like, okay, cool. For 10 grand, you get this, this, this, this, this. And they're like, and then they move to the next. Huh. Interesting. It works really well. You have the clout for it. You have the like authority for it. Yeah. I just want to be I'm I'm sure that you get this a lot, but what people I'm afraid to like charge too much because then maybe they don't extract max value as a I'm sure that's exactly why I don't do it. I'm like, I take 10 grand. and I have to like, you know, I'm not going to sleep until someone makes 100 grand. So, like I refuse to do it right now. But yeah. And one thing I've noticed is uh at least chatting with a bunch of people with these uh info coaching businesses is that do do you notice that people who go through these funnels like 90% of them don't take action afterwards. It's on them. They don't do anything. I that's a real real thing with info. Not as much a thing with coaching. So info Yes. where someone buys a course, whatever the Tony Robbins quote is, it's like 92% of people that buy his products never even log in. Like it's some crazy stat like that. Like that's maybe, you know, yeah, stats are made up on the spot, ladies and gentlemen, but um it's some crazy number like that. Um but coaching, not so much. And like the Pace Morbs of the world, like they have entire like consumptionbased SDRs that literally like hit people up that as CS reps that are like can see how much of the videos they've consumed if they've logged in. and they'll dial them until they get them and like, "Oh, you haven't completed module one. Make sure you get in there." So, they press on getting people to consume because they know that they have the ascension track that once people do XYZ, they then buy the later [ __ ] and they make more money later cuz they already made their money on them buying the info. But where they really make money is them ascending up the tranches of this. So, yes, it's very very common for I mean, me included, right? Like I bought some paper call thing the other day and it's like it's out of pocket. I'm like, I don't want to do that right now. and I just like logged in, looked at some stuff, and I logged out. And it's like, you know, like it happens. Um, but with coaching, it's a lot different because with coaching, so ours for example, it's like they buy on the phone before they're even off the phone, they are now scheduled in with an onboarding. They sk they, you know, talk to a CS onboard, then they get brought over to a coach. Now with a coach, they have onetoone access to them. They have a monthly, you know, cadence of this, twice a week of this, this, this, this, and they get like the most amount of handholding. That's what they're paying for is the accountability, handholding. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Huh. Yeah. Still on the still on the still on the uh fence about this, but we'll see. We'll see where Yeah. No, no. And there's skezy ways to do it. And there's like clean, clear, white hat as can be ways to do it. And I I'll be honest, like I don't know necessarily where I sit on it either sometimes because like I don't like the whole coaches teaching coaches how to coach people. Like I don't like that and like making money by like I I steer as far from that as possible. But I know a lot of people who crush this in using these skill sets and the stack of like info coaching, fulfillment model, and then uh internet marketing to get customers, but they do it in a different like niche, right? It's not a coach selling a coach. It's, you know, ours, it's fitness, right? It's like completely it's it's like outside of the make money online space. It's the make money online stacked on top of the make money online that gets a little gray area to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you What are you What are you like currently working on that you're most passionate about? You said fitness, right? Yeah. Yeah, our main code that you can talk about. Sorry. Yeah. No, no, you're good. No, no, you're good. Our main code is a women's fitness thing, so whatever. 30 million in cash collected last year. We broke everything under the under the sun. Broke and got down to like a million and a half a month, hit three last month, scaling back into it, and we're just trying to like speed run to 10 million a month. Um, and then that's like core business, golden goose, and then now everything with X and YouTube. I really just did this for like talent and like friends to be honest, like network and random stuff. The opportunity inflow is just insanity and like I don't I don't know what to do with it yet. Um, I have no idea what to do with it. So, yeah, I have some stuff cooking, but if I do that, then it like, you know, maybe I just don't want to hurt the main thing. And this is already I don't want to say hurting it, but like already kind of like pushing the mind and distracting to do this other stuff already. And I don't love that. Um, so I'm going to slow down on the videos. I'm not going to do daily soon. Um, that's why I'm thinking too I'm not doing It's hard. It's hard. man. But I think, you know, I think people just starting out, if they want to get into this type of industry, like make money online, and you're already crushing it, man, I' I'd recommend them just create content every day, cuz then it's it's so easy right now to just pop off cuz if you're not dumb and you see like, oh, this video is doing well, this video flopped, just do more of the ones that are doing well and eventually you'll hit a hit an area, even if it's under I don't know like 2K subs. I've seen a guy in the info space making like 100k per month with like 8K subs on YouTube. Oh yeah, dude. Organic zero paid by the way. Zero pay. I How do they even do that? I'm doing something wrong, man. Dude, dude, if I Yeah. One, I think your monetization model is broken for what your what your following is, what your authority is. Like, dude, what I would pay you on certain stuff. Like I think I think there's like a offer monetization model thing that you if you want to again like you said you're kind of back and forth on it. So like you're doing exactly what you want to do. So it's not like a blow at that. But I was talking to someone this morning. They're like how much do you think you could like turn yours right now? And so I'm at five six whatever thousand. I could easily make over 100,000 a month. Yeah. With the opportunity flow. Easy. Yeah. For sure. Easy. And it's like I you know again it's not like beginner friendly. That's why it would be able to do that because I have I mean I have tens and tens and tens and tens of like I you know take a percentage of this or consult me on this or how do you do this or I'll pay you five grand for an hour or this and like I could just build a community. I could build a course. I could do a percentage thing and like I want to go upstream and I don't I like say my videos I'm like I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. And it's like kind of hormosy-esque of like where you get clout almost for or like hate that [ __ ] word. I just don't have a better one for it. like how you can but like how you can have like the authority and like goodwill with the market and I don't want like I don't need the money from that like I don't need it from that but it's also like I'm also I'm missing out on what I could do with it so it's how do I make deal how do I do deals with these people how do I get percents of these things and like be paid for that in that way not that's like oh buy my 5k thing or like oh pay me 10k and you can have an hour of my time and then go hopefully 100 scale do like partnering on stuff. I think that would be Yeah. Have you thought about that? Like cuz that's where um most of my money was made was through partnerships with like other SEO people cuz they they're like experts at networking. I'm I'm like hard on the spectrum, dude. I can't I am so much on there. It's it's terrible. Uh I can't like I I hate networking events. Some of these guys, they're they're great. They're great at that. So the opportunities I get just from YouTube is like by itself worth it. Like if you stop everything all other revenue sources, that's it's it's golden. So yeah, that's kind of my goal is like how do I take percent like I have a couple business like I have two direct that have come through that are like yeah I would take I would take that deal style and then I have like three or four other ones that I put on a short list that I'm like if they would give me whatever percent profit share revenue share whatever the thing is and I just did like a coaching call with them style. So, it's like monetization model. It's still consulting, but it's like instead of a flat fee or not, it's like strictly performance basically. And then the fulfillment is instead of me like in there and like running in like managing team or whatever is just like once a week coaching call. I would love that. And I think I could I think I would I have the awareness or skill set or whatever to take people that are three to 500k to like a million a month. It's just pushing the ball and it's just stuff that we've already run through the gambit and like we know. So, I think that would make hundreds of thousands a month. Nice. Um, what do you We're in like the greatest bull market ever seen in uh in history. What are you What are you doing with your money, dude? Nothing. I I love asking people this cuz people aren't that really. You're just on cash? No. No. I'm just like, yeah, I I said majority cash right now. Um Hey, no way. Are you serious? Yeah. I did the I did the Puerto Rico thing for the last 3 years, so I had like the no tax zone for us. Um, so, so you're back, are you back in? Yeah, I'm outside of it now. So, I just got back into like mainland US and uh, so I had to sell everything. I had to like reset basis. I had to do all of that like end of year and I basically bought back like a majority of anything that was in crypto there. Um, some of the stuff in markets I like, you know, basically sold, rebought so I could just reset basis. Um, but anything other than that I just literally moved all cash and it's just been sitting there. And it also was a perfect time for when the business had its big like pain point and we started we stopped like doing distributions and stopped doing all that kind of stuff because it was in like a rough zone cuz for us like if we're doing like a million and a half month that's like break even basically. Um so the cash flow actually stopped right for me. So again, plenty way too much uh sitting in cash, but like it was nice to have that sitting there versus like fully spread out everywhere and being like like I need to do that. Like I don't need to do anything, right? Because I was sitting cash he heavy. Like even emotionally I just felt like good about it. Um but yeah, I mean I have a I have a decent chunk uh for me at least in crypto that just sits there and mainly ETH because it's just I've had it forever and just bought stuff like that. Uh, I was in penguins way early. Like one ETH I was in penguins and then didn't sell them and then got, you know, 250k airdrop and then didn't sell that and now it's worth like 40 G's. Um, what else? Uh, just a bunch of [ __ ] like that. And then I've I've never I never got to the point where cuz I was in the PR thing, it didn't make sense or wasn't like a necessary action to be like real estate or this or that because it was all just like the online portion just was fine. Um, and then when I got back here, I was like, "Oh, I'm I'm going to focus on it at least enough that I can like park in real estate and do this to like offset tax." And then it just hasn't been an issue because uh we haven't turned enough cash to where it's necessary. And also, I'm kind of like, do I really want to focus on that and like try and learn how to do that and own a bunch of physical [ __ ] when I hate physical [ __ ] And so, I just haven't my my mind hasn't gone to that bucket of like, hey, now I have like so much of a surplus in new cash flow because it hasn't really, you know, you know, formulated for this yet. that I need to do something about it. So, yeah, I I'm not a fan of real estate, actually. It's kind of boring. I don't I don't know about you, but it's boring. Definitely boring. Only reason I would do it is for the taxation portion, which again, now I'm like, "Oh, should I just move back to Puerto Rico?" Like, it's right there in my head. I'm like, "I might just do it." Yeah. Yeah. It's hella boring. And it's like, it's not headache free as people make it sound. Um, it's tons of headache. I I hate it. I hate it. If I were to do everything again, I'd probably buy zero real estate. Um, really just uh I have that place in Portugal that's doing well, but everything else is like subpar. Just below uh market. Yeah, you live you live a wild life. I mean like I I not this last one, but I think the one before is the last like net worth whatever update thing I saw. Um and like you're just you're everywhere, right? And then like I watch these building publiclix and you're physically everywhere. Like you bounce around like crazy. Um like what's your what's your like approach with that? Cuz you just got married, right? Yeah, I just got married. We're we're settled in Vancouver now, though. Um Oh, okay. That was that was my ne that was negotiated with my wife. Um I said, "Yeah, I'll move back to Vancouver." I was in Germany for like seven years. Um she's like, "You have to move back." I was like, "Okay, but we got to travel for two years." So we did that. Um and then now we're back here for good. So Okay. Yeah. It is what it is. But um yeah, the the two years was fantastic. Um cuz I was pretty much we're just doing everything whatever we wanted. Uh like fivestar hotels the whole time. Uh it was Yeah, it was great. It was great. But yeah, that's amazing. Yeah. Pretty You do get tired though. You do get tired. It's It's not like What do the day look like? Cuz I I heard I hear you in some of these videos and you're like, "Oh yeah, then we're off to go do whatever today." Or like, "Oh, literally didn't have time yesterday because we were going back and forth or we were in transit from this then this then this." So like the daily was just you stay somewhere for a week or two, you plug in for a couple hours a day and the rest of the time is you guys go and sightsee or meet up with Yeah, I think when I'm depends on Yeah, pretty much plug in for a week and then we sightsee. Uh weekends I probably work an hour. Weekdays I probably do 4 to 8 hours. Um but I wake up early so that's like the side people don't see. I'm up at like 600 7 a.m. So, crush it. And then then we go out and explore stuff like that. It's It's pretty damn tiring. So, I have to be in bed earlier. No. Uh can't can't have too much to drink. Can't have too much wine. Um if we meet up with friends, oh, got to go home early, you know, a big day tomorrow. Stuff like that. Um but it's fine. It's fine. I think uh to the young people out there who've made it probably definitely get out there. Um, the people I met on my on my travels have been incredible. Yeah. Yeah. I just made a video yesterday that was uh how isolation cost me millions or whatever. And it was like I just got back from this event. It's like in I I'm such an introvert and I just have been in the cave. The one in London, right? You said Yeah, that one. And like once How much was that? Sorry. 20 uh or I'm sorry. I think you were selling it for 25 25 to the public and then it was like 10 or 20 or something included on top of your 10 or 20 that you already paid for ADFL like these other ones. So yeah, it was definitely up there. But there were some whales in the room like whales. And yeah, so we hung out with all them and then we left and then went to downtown lending because it was like in the countryside. You're just doing the math in your head. It's like yeah now it's like 5 million probably a year a day. Um, but so going from that to downtown and having a couple people we met from there and then them being like, "Oh yeah, then we'll bring so and so." Next thing you know, I'm at like, you know, Paddle or Podel or whatever with like some sickos. They invite us out to a dinner. It's two or three more sickos. Then we go to this lot cigar thing and then more people. And I'm like, "Wow, like I just missed out on this." I never I've never done anything like that in my life. Like really never. Like I've gone to a couple lead genen conferences and it's like oh so and so know so and so or like the chandelier bar do stuff like that. Like that's probably the closest I've been to that. But in terms of like info coaching land or that kind of space like I just haven't. Um and I definitely not the travel part. Like I just don't like I'm not I'm not the guy who goes and looks at the waterfalls or like wants to go and do thing. Like I just don't work with that. It's just per like it's just not a fan. Um, but I've leaned too far in the other direction where it's like too far and just I sit at this desk 16 hours a day or I don't leave wherever I live. And it's insane the conversations that we had. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. Why don't you host it? You can host it. I know. I'm kind of like in that of like where I could or would. Um, I had some conversations with them about it because like I like what they're building there. I think that those are some good guys. I think they're getting the right people in the room. But I'm in like, for example, I'm in three or four of those versions of those groups. They're kind of the only ones who are doing info coaching specific. The other ones have some lead genen or some affiliate like kind of pullover, but I'm in like two or three different affiliate chat of those on Telegram. Um I don't know. Just comes back to like what you're saying is like does it should it be monetized? If it is monetized, what's the price at where it's like people take it seriously, but also like it makes sense. I don't really want to sell anything, but I want all those people in the right room. you do an event, you know, those things cost hundreds of thousands of dollars when done right. Like they crushed the event. They did such a nice job. Such an they rent out the entire mansion and like the whole hotel, like all the grounds were all just for the 50 people that were there. Like it's crazy. Sick sick. Um yeah, I I I've tried doing versions of that. Well, no, not even close to that, but I just threw meetups, but those even those cost a lot. Like I I was spending like 10 G's. I was fronting it. I was like free. Everyone anyone who's killing it can come go through an application process. My EA does everything. Uh only killers in the room. And we brought together like some insane people. Spent like 10 G's on drinks. Um I don't know. I I definitely no ROI for me, but that was fun. It was great. Um you know what I mean? Um that was great. 4 in the morning. It was at like 4 in the morning and we're all sitting outside still and then uh like half the room. So it's probably 10 20 of us still which is crazy behavior just sitting out there at the thing and uh all of a sudden they come out with like bottle service like not like full bottle service but like the the chest the they come out with ice chest and it has like four bottles in it and this and that and like all the mixers whatever. It's 4 in the morning. I'm like what are you doing? They're like oh we had to hit the minimum or whatever. It's like yeah it's crazy behavior. Like the drinks add up. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. But the event was good. How you said it was 50 people. Yeah, it was probably 50. Yeah. Or so. So that's crazy. Yeah. And then you have the people who like probably didn't necessarily pay like some real real big hitters that were just like invited that are his good friends that brought a bunch like you know thirst Mike Thirstston's there. Um super super nice cool guy. Uh Dave Fogerty so big the Australian and big ecom guy. Yeah. So like a lot of those guys were there. Um which are just like his friends and you know it was just it was cool. It wasn't like everyone like rushing around certain people which you get at bigger events with kind of like the different authorities. Um yeah, they just put together a great thing. But no, I would definitely be it's potentially in the cards for me to build something that's similar to that or partnerships or something to where cuz that's definitely what my audience or whatever has become or what the crowd is. So I think that could be good. But let me pull up some of these questions. See what else we got in here. So the people you and I are just jamming and I love it. Yeah. Um all right, next one on here. SEO rank and rent versus pay-per- call. So, have you ever done any of that stuff for paper uh like lead gen style for paid? Yeah. Yeah. For paid. Um like I guess like yeah, you have you have right you have rank you have SEO rank and rent, you have paper call, you have you know lead forms, you have all this kind of stuff when it comes to like lead genen bucket and then you have paid versus organic. Like have you ever done the paid version ever? I have. Yes. Um, but those are typically what we run those as is like break even. So what we do is let's say I have a rank and rent let's say in roofing in Vancouver. All right, I signed someone for two grand but the rank and rent isn't ranking yet. So I just put that two grand into paid while we wait for the Google side to rank and then we start cutting back spend as the rankings go up, stuff like that. Um, there's there's a ton ton of tricks you can do. Uh we actually actually flipped out of um the largest towing directory in the US beforehand, but that that got too sketchy for me. Um so we had like a massive towing directory. Uh people can look it up. It's like completely clapped now. Thank god I sold it, but it was called towinglist.com. Um but halfway through I realized, yo, I'm I'm calling a bunch of guys on going on sales calls for them to rent out like the East Coast. I realized I'm talking to the same guy and I'm pretty sure that guy is part of the mob and I was like, "No, I'm out. Like I'm I'm good on this. Uh probably got to flip out of this because he's starting to make like very subtle threats and I was like, no, I think for this I'm out." Um so I sold it. It was uh yeah, halfway through I was like, "No, probably not the industry for me." I didn't know to was like that. I thought it was more um white hat than that. But um apparently in the US people can just tow your car randomly and then just bring bring it to the uh Yeah. Um especially in some of those areas uh less Yeah. where it's more pretty savage. Pretty savage out here. But um that was crazy. That was a crazy one. What you typically need to do in rank and rents is get a Google location verified. If people want to get into it, just get it get it verified. I don't care how you do it. Just do it and the calls will just start flowing in. It's that easy. Especially in small cities like tier two, tier three cities. Yeah. Done and dusted. Just get it verified. The guy that initially sent me your stuff um that's a good friend. He slowly but surely has been building those up. And so he has however many tens I think now of like Google My Businesses set up that are all running to different things and pick whatever industry call it, you know, roofing because that's what we talked about. They're not roofing but and he sends me a thing. He's like making three to 5 hundred bucks a day just sending the calls through networks. Yeah. He he'd make more money if he went direct, but it's just so low. Like you don't have to do anything with these call networks. But um Yeah. Yeah. Cuz he tried to send some stuff. We have mutual people basically, you know, like let's say we had a friend that owns a roofing company in this example, um which is what we have but for a different niche. And then he had these coming in but like they weren't the business wasn't converting them correctly, right? And that's the other beauty of like a call network or one of these networks is they run them through these call centers that are like really hard conversion focused. Um but you still make less. So I guess it doesn't really matter for you because you don't care about what the quality uh or what the conversion rate is. You care about what your cost your you know rev per lead is. But yeah, he's got whatever 3 to 500 bucks a day just like passive now from that. That's awesome. That's awesome. From watching your stuff, it's actually that easy. That's the worst part. Um you know what's even easier? If you go to out go outside of the US like Australia, uh, Canada, UK, so easy. Like I've never seen anything like it. I think we ranked someone in Berlin, Germany. It roofing keyword. So in two days or something like that. I just did it as a case study for my friend in Berlin. It was that easy. And he he just picked up like a 150k deal for roofing in Berlin just from that. It's like can't can't even believe it. It's uh I I can't believe um people aren't more on this right now. Maybe I don't know why. Maybe it's just like confusing. I don't know. Yeah, I'm trying to take that same friend. I'm like, dude, like I own, you know, XYZ. I own insuranceclients.com or I own this and that. Like, let's try and like do something here. And he's like, ah, no, like I don't [ __ ] with paid. Like, I just don't need it. Like, why would I do that? And then I have to worry about the spend and the volatility and all this. I'm like, yeah, you're not wrong. I was like, but I just want to add two two zeros to the ad budget. And he's like, yeah, no. Okay. Um, okay. So that's the So I think that's what he meant then probably on SEO rank and rent verse paper call because paper call you know is we've had guys on here like Carlos um we had Adam Young on here who owns Ringba like those guys and they're just paid juggernauts. Those are guys are spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands a day towards paper call. Oh really? Oh yeah. What offer? What offer is that? You're so funny. Um, so the so there's like on the online world, how I see it at least is like all this, there's like the SEO guys, there's the agency guys, which are tons of different services, there's info coaching, and then there's like lead genen affiliate uh, and SAS. I think there's that's it. But these lead genen affiliate guys, you're one of the only ones that I've personally followed that do like the search or like do the the organic version of that. Most of them do this paper call thing. So, like I have friends that literally spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a day on uh debt, Medicare, um uh I'm blanking right now, but you know, all ACA, like these different ones, um final expense leads, whatever. And they'll spend 100 grand to make, you know, 20% margin, and they'll make 20 G's a day in profit on something like that. They do it then, you know, they'll do side quests and do the affiliate offers where they just rip and pump like ClickBank offers. And you know, I know guys that do half a million a day with those when they're hot and that's just their game. So, they just crank that, but it's all paid advertising. So, it's all Meta, Tik Tok, um some Google PMAX style stuff. You know, I'm not a master of that game, but they'll do that and then they'll do paper call or they'll do direct toart affiliate or they'll do um uh lead forms. So, the paper call stuff is like super hot right now, but it's whatever. After 120 seconds, you get paid 19 bucks. And it's like how many of those you generate a day? They have 19 buyers. They use Adam Young software, Ringbud to route and do all this kind of stuff or retriever or whatever. And that's how they do size. And then like I know guys who have sold those companies for 50, 60, whatever million once they package them up because they just have consistent acquisition. Wow. Wow. Man, this it's such a different industry, huh? So interesting. Here the other side of it, man. That I I this is what I always say with the SEOs. These guys think way too small. They're like happy with their like in your in your industry, these numbers are insane. Like the SEO guys are happy with 10K a month, but because they're like 99% profit, right? Part Yeah, that's the insane part is like for I literally was sitting with these guys and they were in uh in when we were in PR and they were like, yeah, they were telling me about the first time they ever spent 100 grand a day, I think it was. and uh 100 grand a day, but they were had been spending five grand, seven grand, got up to 10 grand and they were hanging out with this whale that spends like seven figure days and has like multiple across multiple things and like different niches and whatever. And he was like, we were partying and he just goes, "Add a zero to your ad budget and don't open your laptop for a day at a zero, right? You're spend 10 G's a day now spend 100. Just let it go." I'm like, "What?" Like and that's the crazy part is it literally like it doesn't it's not that easy necessarily but like he they did it and they they add they added a zero and he's like halfway through the day we checked and we were like a little bit lagging but we were basically breaking even and by the end of day it like broke through and this is probably whatever four or five or probably longer than that five six years ago that these guys would have been doing this but the scale in which you can take these things when they're in like these blue ocean style markets and the the size of them or like I had Carlos on here and Carlos gets to the point where he now has all these people that buy traffic then through him. So, it's almost like brokerage style. So, they'll do they do uh on Harry's I could say over 100K a day uh essentially, but they do over 100K a day through their own media buying and then their network of other media buyers all through to that's all and it's all paper uh paper call. So, it's um it's final expense, it's auto insurance, it's debt, it's refi, it's all that stuff. Crazy. Crazy. It's crazy. And it's lead forms and routing pages. It's a It's a quiz lander to uh yeah, you qualified. Click this call. Click the call. Call it. It's a ring tree or whatever it's called. And then it just goes to the different buyers. This one pays 19 per call. This one pays 23. This one pays, you know, only on revshare. They route based on who's available and which one can pay more and like what like and that's how they play. Man, this is like it's this is such a painful call for me because now I want to go and research [ __ ] whereas I should be doing actual work on my businesses. This is rough, man. This is rough. Well, here other question. Are blogs still worth it? This is a good one. Um, yes, but um I think most people don't do it right. Uh, most people are like blast because of like the prevalence of AI content. People are just blasting it and that's instant like you get clapped instantly. Yeah, Google has like such such strict filters now. Um, pretty much TLDDR is Yes. optimize properly now. Um, go through something like Neuron Writer on AppSumo. Very cheap. Get it going. Run it through once. Try to do maybe one, two posts a day. That's it. Don't do the hundreds of posts a day you see on X. That [ __ ] does not work. Um, especially on most of your most people's domains. If it's very weak, like your your domain is blacklisted immediately. Um, it's like destroyed. So, what what we do when we're spamming in the black hat SEO space um is we find a super strong domain. Let's say you go through GoDaddy auctions and those can take a beating, right? So, you take like an expired, I don't know, crypto project that used to be like a billion market cap. Then you run heavy affiliate articles through those. You th everything. You do like dick pills, you do supplements, you do at all at the same time. and some of them will rank and then you're trying to make all their money back in like the first couple days before it gets burned before Google catches on. Um, but yeah, to answer your question, blogs work, but if you push too hard, you're it's it's like blacklisted and you don't recover. People have to realize you don't recover. No one recovers anymore. So, it's just you got one shot. Yeah. Yeah. So, for we always talk about it on here, the like acquisition method, the monetization method, and the fulfillment method. So for like a blog, so like my mom, right? Vegan vegan blog recipe. So for acquisition side of it of a blog, you have essentially we're just using search, right? That's what the whole point of this is. It's like search traffic. The ways to monetize are are like what are the core ones? So it's display ads, display. Yep. Um ebooks, I guess. Ebooks. That's where I was going to go with it. So then it can break off into this info coaching land where like it can go upstream and like do that and that's where I'm like kind of looking like oh should I do that for my mom just as like a funny case study thing is like should I build some like 5k offer and like or community paid community something and then just build this like 100k a month business around my mom like just for sport and I think like that would be I think that would be funny but I just I think in the vegan space by the way um you should look into Facebook traffic have organic Facebook it's crazy right now. Have you have you looked into that? We have a group we have a group that has like 20,000 people in it. Yeah. So the the funnel goes like this for organic Facebook. It's if you want to pay pay money. Sure. This is what people typically do. They buy page likes. They post like super clickbaity uh posts on Facebook. Never link in the first post. It's always it's kind of like X where you have to do like oh finger down in the thread get the you know [ __ ] like that. And then people are doing not not not like crazy info numbers but like 1 to 10k per day on mediavine type numbers on display if you go viral. So you have to say some outrageous things you know in that space. Um but that that fully works still right now. Um so interesting and then you just send them over the blog and then it's all and the page likes are like percentages of cents per page like cuz no one runs those. It's like you know what I mean? Um, but make sure you just run it in high RPM places like the US, Canada, so on and so forth, and you're done. Interesting. Yeah, you'll see those ads like, oh, uh, click like if you like Jesus, or click like if you like, uh, golden retrievers. Stuff like those type of ads. And then you get fed like, oh, best, I don't know, my my dog almost died by eating this supplement. Try this instead. Stuff like that. It sends off works so well. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just You should run one of those up. It just like just were fun, you know? Yeah. I'm to the point like I was here I I remember watching all whenever I would watch stuff it was like oh and this new thing or like this oneoff crazy thing we found and all that and like I'm so much more hesitant to be like I only really want to like do something if I see legs with it and like it can scale and it's such a silly way to look at it because it's like everything starts unscalable, right? And then you can scale it or you could build a machine around like events for example like we won't host events because I'm like oh my gosh sounds like a nightmare and then you have other guys like Eman or whatever who have like event machine built around it. They have an entire ClickUp board or whatever it is or not, 500 and something tasks and when they want another one they just dup it and then they start over again and it's like they've systemized it or systematized it or whatever and it's like crazy behavior. Um, you got a pop here in a couple minutes. So, what is uh what else do you want people I mean what's hot right now? What is what's where do people find you? What is the goal um of what you're trying to build right now? Um, probably looking into software maybe do consumerf facing software. interesting using AI. I have um business partner XFang cracked. Um so we're we're gonna try to figure it figure it out. Yeah. So we'll we'll figure it out. Um something in software though. It's it's stupid easy right now. Farming up Tik Tok accounts. I've just purchased like a 100 Tik Tok accounts for US-based Tik Tok accounts for like five bucks. So I'm ready to run it. Um but yeah, shit's going to about to go crazy. I'm like cuz I'm too cheap. I'm like trying to figure out everything organic. You know what I mean? Try to game the algo and that's like my my cut of the pie. But I I'll figure it out. People can find me on X though. Indexy. Just search Jackie Chow. Um and yeah, if if people want to learn about local SEO, it's stupid easy. Your friend did it. So if I can do it, anyone can do it. Um yeah. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. No, we'll definitely have to pop on and do another one of these where we're like crazy tactical and some random thing like we we live build like I see all your stuff is so good about or just go on his YouTube too by the way because he does so many of these fun like random days where you just go so deep in a topic exactly how to do something a toz and it's like I've picked up some of those and we've used pieces of that and you sparked different things and we hired like a certain SEO guy and next thing you know we have branded XYZ content that now is number one across everything and it's like and that's yeah I get the ideas from watching your stuff so super super valuable. Appreciate it, man. Thanks for having me on, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. All right, guys. We're going to pop. We got a quick one, hour long, cuz we both got [ __ ] to do. So, talk to you soon. I think today was the day 96 in a row. Peace, Tim. Take it easy, mate.

# how i lost millions by staying home?? (real story) | EP95
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1NAOstFZm0

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about how staying isolated cost me millions. We're going to go through the hidden cost, the compounding effect this caused, how to get into highle rooms, what I'm calling the proximity rule, the online version of this, and my plan to fix my 10 years of isolation. All right. Last year, we did $30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 76 million in total cash collected. I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what didn't work for us, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. I am in transit. I have to do video today, and this is the only time I have on a 30 minute layover. So, we're going to get right into it. Sorry for the audio. So, the hidden cost, uh, I mean, frankly, I literally stayed locked inside for like 10 years. Um, in terms of like business and and networking, doing all these things. Um, so what happened over that time is you you have friends that don't have similar interests, which is not necessarily a problem. Um, but it can become annoying to, you know, your I call them old friends, but like your original friends, your hometown friends love dearly. Um, and same thing with family, partner, whatever. But like when they're the only people that you have as an outlet to talk to about what you're doing, um, you end up almost like living two lives, right? You have your personal life and you have a professional life. Um, and a lot of people, if you see, you know, you play the comparison game and see these people online, they do what seems to be one, uh, one life combined. Uh, and for a long time, that wasn't it for me, right? So um living two lives or you have this whole personal life that you do and then you have this whole professional which is very normal common for like most people. Um but there is a compounding effect and there is a a cost to that when you do it in these two different buckets where you're only in it in this and then in it in this uh and I do believe in obviously having separation and having like a personal life and doing that stuff even if I don't do it perfectly well. Um but when you're trying so hard to grow in the business side of things um you're essentially you know missing this leverage of what you get from being around other people even just having other friends. So like when you're only working with people and that's the only kind of connection you have and that's what I had for like 10 years was my only connection or talk about work was with work people which then become friends for sure but like it just is it's just different. All right. So, um, getting into that then the compounding, if I look back, I mean, the the missed mentorships and deals and the whole reason this is all coming up is cuz I just got back from a big event. Um, and like a trip that was all it was just insane how much value I got just out of being in the room with the people more so than the actual like the content was amazing that was in the room and at the event. Um, but it was much more about the people in the room and then even staying a couple days longer and then people I got to network with while there. Um, that so and so is friends with, you know, next connection away. Uh and then same thing with this online version of everyone who's in DMs and you know that I'm having conversations with now. It's like it's astounding to me. Uh I'm 90 whatever four or five days into doing this and actually like being public and I have literally like high hundreds of people that I'm now connected with that can help with this or this or this. So like I've obviously missed out on mentorships, deals, opportunities, not like talent, all the things just by not doing this. And I'm only doing like an online version as of now. Um, this is like my first time honestly like going out of the house basically. So, um, you know, if this then that, like if you met this person and then had this connection or if you were all, you know, side by side doing this. Like I have so many of these and I'm trying to kind of like reduce that. And again, sorry for the audio. I'm literally in an airport, but like I got to get this video out. So, um, I just have so many if this and I'm just trying to be like cognizant of that that it happened. It's over. It's gone. I can't do anything about it. I only have right now. So, I'm like hitting it so hard. It's because I'm seeing the opportunity that exists. um skills times eyeballs. There's a way better say this and I can't remember what it is, but essentially like even if you have all these high skills, you don't have eyeballs. Even if that's just friends, not even like an audience or whatever. We're not even talking about audience today at all. This is all about just literally friends and connections you have and network uh actually, you know, is your impact. So, there's a caveat to that and like obviously throughout this like we've made good money, we've got done good things without any of this um because we do still have leverage through whatever, right? Through team, through media, through ads. It's like there's people who are completely anonymous that have very limited friends and can still crush it if like financial is your metric. Um, but if your metric is like friends and like network and like access to this and that and like the ability to do whatever like you need people to do that and I have played the short game of not doing that for a very very long time. Um, and it's definitely like hurt me. Um, or just I've I haven't lived up to the opportunity of it. So now we're going to talk about high level rooms because I think this is kind of like the key of what I'm trying to get at. So for me, this one we just went to was considered like a mastermind event. Uh, usually I avoid going to like anything. So I my kind of like plan on this that I'll get into down here, but the main places and these are quick things I have done over the last years, but like mastermind events huge. So like the right people in the right because a lot of time these are framed more as like yes, there's presentations, but it's really more about like who's in the room uh and like who you're talking to and the dinners and the in between and all that kind of stuff more so than like the actual content. Conferences can be very similar. Um, so you have like your vendor rooms generally, you have like your main stage presentation, but these are also like meant to be like, you know, like if you talked about uh if I was talking to uh Carlos, like he was like, "Oh, you know, the uh chandelier bar." So all these lead genen guys, they all go to almost all the events and like all of the actual like deals and like connections get done outside of the room. Uh, which is very cool, but again, like I haven't really leaned into that. Like I've gone to a couple of them. And I mean, I went to one, this is so bad, but I went to one that I went completely alone and literally met no one. I flew across the world. I'm not going to talk about this, but like I flew across the world to go to an affiliate conference cuz I was like, "Oh, maybe I can do affiliate when this was like years ago." And I literally talked to no one except like random people I met that were not even part of the conference and just like party and like kind of try to like do my thing to meet people and I got zero value for because I didn't do anything right. I was like so shy and like didn't do whatever. It was terrible. So like do these the right way. Um paid and free groups. What I mean by this is and I talked about this in other videos but like I've met the some of the core people I've met have been inside of paid groups. So, like a paid course, paid coaching, paid whatever. And then I'm inside the groups. And I'm usually not that vocal in them, but like I'll see the people who stand out because they're vocal in them because they actually have that skill. And um I've met a lot of good people. That's how I met Luke. That's how like all of this started. Um and a lot of cool people have been met through that. And as well as free groups. They have free groups on Facebook. They have them everywhere. And I'll go into that in the online version. Um but then the big thing is really like being able to just go to the dinners, go to the trips, know people to, you know, group up with and go to trips. And that can be as just like completely friendly. It can be business related. It can be, you know, both. But when your friends are people who also do similar stuff of work or, you know, adjacent stuff, and I'll get into that. Um, but you can just learn so much. You can provide value. They can provide a ton of value. They can know someone that they can connect you with. Like that happened like 500 times um in the last 4 days. Um, and it's just like so eye opening to me. So, proximity rule of this, location, location, location. So, online is like one whole bucket, but we're going to talk about like the inerson version. the being able to like live with people like be near them and like live life with them was like a really interesting thing I I heard a lot of these guys like when we were just in London talk about so they go to dinners constantly like with their friends with their with their boys with the girls like they go out and do that and also side tangent I have like 98% male so when I say guys and this and that like that's what this is about but like I'm very I I just don't know anyone in the space or no one reaches out that is that but dinners trips cigars whatever they like constantly there are constantly doing these things together and like you see it all over social you see it on X you see it on Instagram you see it wherever and like I've just never had that where I have like friends that I go out and do these things with where we also talk about work and when I'm like so work focused it's always been like for me dinners are like with my friends friends but we don't talk about that and again I'm like annoying when I talk about this kind of stuff and like that's not my goal and right so you almost like shy away and don't want to talk about it um and then you just like resort to kind of doing this online version but I think there's so much value in doing it like actually in person being able to do that and then having the uh environment. So for the online version, this is basically what I'm doing now, but what I still did not do for like 10 years. So you see like Instagram, a lot of people use it for like the visual I mean honestly most of the guys I know literally either do it for like to optimize for you know mating or they optimize it for business and that's kind of it. And like I am not I you know mine just existed and like I still don't even know how to use it but like I want to only use it for business like it just strictly for workrelated style stuff. X I've used now as a platform that then kind of fuels into YouTube which is funny because I feel like it's kind of usually the other way around but like that's kind of how it's worked for me. This has been huge value ad. The only people I'm connect with here are business. Uh and I like this YouTube has been an outlet for me to obviously do things like this which is like a lot of out like spewing and like output which I'm not a super fan of honestly. Um and it's not very like connection oriented but it has led to tons of connections because of what I'm putting out which I like a lot. Facebook uh it used to be like the biggest thing especially for like the high ticket space and like info coaching like all the info guys were on there and that was because of the traffic funnels of the world and school at the time or not school uh consulting at the time or ovens and whatever like all those groups were on Facebook and that was just like the place to have groups that's where all the internet marketers were because they were in paid groups or they were in paid courses and communities that had their group on Facebook so everyone's like friends you click on anyone and there's like you know everyone has 300 mutual friends so this but then the groups were really the key here and there's some really good ones uh nothing held back group by Alen Sultanic. That one has like I don't even know 50,000 8,000 something members in it and that has a bunch of good people. Now it's turned into like W school whatever. These are generally there are free ones but there's a lot of paid groups in here which I think are super super valuable. I'm actually not in any of these that I actively am in but I would like to. And then the core core ones end up in iMessage, WhatsApp and Telegram. So iMessage start like I've heard on a lot of podcasts like oh you know like the ecom hitters and like these top guys that do 50 100 whatever million have like groups where they just share what's working now I'm in paid groups like um like the AFL one I'm in for example like they use WhatsApp um and a couple other good ones use that telegram this is a big one for crypto uh for lead genen for affiliate for everything honestly but like all of these have their own like pockets of this so you're basically doing this but just like digitally which is cool but like it is missing a flavor like a piece of it um that I think is like really really valuable. So just as like a recap before we go into my plan to fix it. Um so I'm just bummed honestly I'm just bummed that I missed out on a lot of this and there's kind of only way to just look forward and just be like okay what can I change about that? Um the amount of compounding that I miss that I see if I was to do like you know comparison game is like nutty. uh absolutely insane like just sitting in London and like everyone who knows everyone and they're playing this they're you know sport together doing breakfast here going on whatever and talk about the trips they all go on and then oh so and so mets like I just I missed it right so now I'm trying to do the other direction of compounding I basically compound down and now I'm trying to compound up in doing this um high level rooms I'm just going to like literally you know I've just seen how valuable these are to be in the right room especially the paid to play ones and it's kind of like counterintuitive cuz there's probably ones that are free that are like amazing but there's something about like people who pay to So there's the outlier of people who you're like, "Okay, wow." Um, but a majority of the time like the people in the room are all there for the same reason, which is like a really good thing. Um, proximity thing, moving, living near, doing all that, like this is huge. Um, and then you all kind of like grow together, which I think is really cool. Um, and then the online version is really, you know, exactly what I say it is, which is essentially what I'm doing right now. So, my plan to fix it. So, I want to start doing essentially like some version of like a monthly trip. I don't know if it's going to be monthly. just threw, you know, cadence on here, but call it every 60 days, 90 days. Um, I want to make a whole another video on how I'm going to start to like break out the work in personal because I think it's really important and I've been like botching that. So, I want to focus on doing like a quarterly one. Ovens used to have a thing that was like he does a force time off every 90 days. Um, and I know like, you know, Iman has his stuff and like I'm talking about all these like big guys, but like you know, it's who I used to consume content of like I just consumed a ton of content for 10 years. These guys used to have examples of how they would do, you know, 90-day sprints and then go do like relaxation trips and stuff and that that's more on the personal side of things. But on the business or connection side, it's like, okay, per right now I live somewhere that does not have an active community of this. So like monthly trips to places that there are or just big cities. So think of your Londons, think of your Scottsdale, think of your Miami, think of your Dubai, think of like these places um that are like kind of hot spots for what we do for work, right? Info coaching, um agency, SAS, whatever, lead genen. So, uh, doing monthly trips where I can be in a cadence of being around people that do it. Conferences and events, I'm just going to start going to all of them. Um, I don't even need to necessarily go to the actual event or just like be there. Like I went to the lead genen, uh, one that was in Vegas and like we don't even get tickets for it. Um, and you know, you talk to the guys and it's like you actually meet the people in the vendor rooms and you do real business in there, but you also like if you have a foot in, you already know somebody or you kind of have whatever you can say you're there, you can meet XYZ, they know someone, there's some event, there's some party, there's some whatever you can go to. So, I'm going to start uh making sure that I prioritize these and do them in an intentional way where it's like, oh, this is the next layer of what we want to learn or get around, not just like go to go. So, that's going to be a big one. Uh I'm going to move. So, uh again, I'm in a location right now. That was just kind of like the next step. Um but I'm definitely going to move slash have like multiple spots. So, I like where I'm at because it's family, friends, you know, girlfriends, stuff like that. Um but the next thing is going to be going somewhere uh that will have like a um higher whatever um intensity or or concentration uh of the right people which is like a big focus for me. So again think of all those cities I said um Puerto Rico um Scottdale, London, Dubai, whatever. Um and then maybe even have multiple spots that I can bounce around to. That would be a different game for a different reason. Um but do something like that. Uh another thing that someone was talking about that I had never even thought of was like living with people. Um, so I've never done this uh ever really. Like I don't think I literally have ever had like a roommate in like the last 10 years. Um, but people are talking about how like popular this is. Same thing with trips. It's like you're constantly like with people and in groups. So you're like bouncing things off. You're not just like in your own head or just like only doing the online version. Uh, I don't know if I want to do that and I don't really know if my life's in a place where that makes sense for me, but like I know it makes sense for a lot of people. Um, so moving multiple spots, being actually open to doing this and like having the concept of this um, because I just have been so shy away like not doing for a long time. Another big one that I need to figure out is like this personal CRM or like have an EA or something. Um because I have hundreds of people and I am like already losing track of it and it's like one's on WhatsApp, one's on Telegram, one's on iMessage, everything's on Instagram, everything's on X and I'm like completely moving losing track of them. Uh which I don't love. Um excuse me. So I've heard these are like just a mess, but like there's definitely a way to do this. And then yeah, building a system around this entire thing. So, building a system around the cadence, building a system around how I store these, building a system around how I set up everything, dinners, events, calls, meetings, whatever. And then like right now, I'm kind of doing a version of it with these like, you know, what's working now conversations I'm doing where I get to meet these people. But like, you know, having proper data on this and like where people live and like when, you know, there's overlap or there's trips or event people going to just keeping a pulse on that so I have a system so I can actually have the touch points because I know me and I will fall things will fall through the cracks. I will miss stuff. I will not follow up correctly. Um, and also just like stuff like this for me is going to be very it's going to be much easier for me to like basically be able to remember the important things. Like I'm I'm pretty bad at that. And I think it's pretty important to do that with like personal relationships. Like I don't want to use this as like a oh I just like hit people up when I need something. Like that's not my goal and like to have shallow relationships. Um but at the same time like let's be honest like you have hundreds of people it's going to be very difficult to remember all the details. Uh and I want to be able to do that in a good way. So I'm not just coming to story like oh yeah yo like remind me of this and this like and you know you don't know anything about their family their personal life their whatever if they've already shared it with you like that's not cool and I know me and I will drop the ball on that. So I want to build a system around it have all these things. So yeah that's the general gist cost me probably tens and tens. I mean we've I I was going to do a video uh today about how we lost you know or not lost but opportunity cost loss whatever you want to call it. Um lost like 50 probably million on just things that I've learned but I'm like oh we could have done this different. I could have done this. In hindsight, it's like 2020 for sure, but just some real obvious ones after being at some of these events that I'm like, "Oh, wow. Did we drop the ball on that?" Oh, wow. Did we drop the ball on that? But this was top of mind. So, I wanted to share this with you guys. Um, I have like, you know, x amount of hours left until the end of the day and I literally have a layover and I have to get to a flight. So, I'm going to have to cut this one shorter than usual. Um, but yeah, all the videos are here. I have a couple good uh www.rankclug.comdoc is all the videos. I've done this 95 days in a row. I'm going to 100 before phase two, which I think I'm going to switch up the cadence and I have something cool to announce uh around there that has come specifically or directly from this. So, pretty excited for that and uh yeah, that's what I got. So, I'll talk to you guys soon and uh keep crushing it. Hit me up on IG if you have any questions.

# $75M Media Buyer Shares All... (Info/Coaching & Ecom) | EP94
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0yCKC2eTQ4

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing a live Q&A around marketing, media buying, all the things. We've got Luke here, co-founder and business partner, and Marius. Marius, close enough. And he does a media buying and a ton of media buying for guys in info and coaching space. So, we're going to go through the type form and go through all the questions. First one we got on here, uh, can you go more in depth about my Google friends angle with his Google My Vist my listing and affiliate PPC? So, on episode 85, I talked about somebody who does Google My Business um that essentially does localized Google My Business, has a bunch of them, let's just say, uh call it 50 of them that are in different cities and then he optimizes them for search engines and then has different paper call like different link uh phone numbers in there that then route out to networks and private buyers. So, he'll let's say landscaping for example or like pool installation. Uh he will have uh Google My Business, someone says, you know, pool installation or pool design near me. They look it up and Google My Business is one of the top things that uh pop up as like a local business near me. They click on the phone number, but it's not an actual direct business. It's just used for lead genen. So then he'll route them to local ones and people will pay $150 a lead or $12 a lead or $2 a lead depending on what network and what buyer. Um so he does that and is crushing it. Um last time I talked to him, he was doing whatever $300 to$500 bucks a day in profit. Um you know him actually, I'll tell you after this, but um yeah, cool dude and crushes it. He's done everything you can imagine. He just doesn't really like ad spend, doesn't really like the headache of it and like all that and doesn't like to media buy. So, he just does everything organic and just slow builds these things. So, that's that one. Next one from test at Gmail. I tell everyone they can put whatever email they want on here and put a fake one so they don't get docked. Uh, I have a business that sends super expensive home inspections that sends super insp expensive home inspections which are health focused. Okay. How would you market or position and how would you what would your funnel be? who've been going through referral partners but want to go direct and that I assume that came from you because that's not my land. Super expensive home inspections that are health focused. So they're basically I imagine they're doing something where people go and check out like check for mold, check for whatever. What kind of funnel would you do or just how would you get clients? I mean probably two options. Uh first one lead forms. The only problem with pleat forms would be the quality. Um but I've been actually talking with a lot of guys that do spend a decent amount of dollars a day and they just have lead forms. The only thing the only secret there is to properly uh route. So if the lead does not seem qualified, just do not fire anything on lead form because there's no pixel. So the only way for you to have good quality is let someone be an application only if they have every single requirement. So that would be option number one. Offer number two, have like a type of funnel because it's a very direct offer. Like you don't have to do a lot of convincing on that one. Like you just show them the offer, make them apply, see if they are a good lead or not. That's it. Make your if you send your type form, same thing. Have routing. If the lead does not answer like all of your questions the way you needed to, don't hire anything on them. We still call them. But yeah, we have uh a friend that does home services that does in person, uh Cody, and he was talking about this uh when we were on his uh podcast or whatever we're on, and he was talking about how it's basically like a cleaning service, like a home cleaning service, and they'll run localized ads. And the biggest difference, and what we kind of broke down on there was changing the offer. And he had talked to other guys who were like doing three times the amount on his I just inhaled that. We were talking uh odd on his about um basically how he had a buddy that was doing three times and the offer the only difference was that just how they structured the offer everything same media buyer same whatever same whole thing and so that was a big one. So for them it was like uh you know a free cleaning basically uh for their home and then it comes in there. So whatever. So that's the two things it's like yeah so the actual technical is run some application form lead form something so you get qualification you get all the information obviously run them localized to wherever you are and then the biggest thing on there is what offer. So it's a free home inspection. It's a free this and that likely and then once you're in there as you sell the service once you identify that there's a problem once you whatever xyz. So anything else I mean no I say that's it. Um ju just to add on top of that now you say this uh we do run some legion ads for a company in the pest control space and one of the biggest differences we see in quality is the type of offer we run it's like oh is it um 10 leads in 30 days or I'll get you 10 clients or I'll get you this I'll get you that or in your case like I guess it's vice versa because it's you want to get customers but yeah the the offer changed a lot. Yeah. And just for context, how much uh have you spent on meta, you think? I I would say across meta on Google. 75 75 million. So he does a lot of the big info. $75 total. Yeah. Got my first lead gen client. Um so no. Yeah, he spends mainly in info and uh ecom, but info like he does some of the biggest guys that we know, the eight figure a month guys at times, the a lot of things. So just FYI. Um next one in here. What is the best funnel for organic audience high ticket info and how would you go about sending traffic to it? Okay. Well, how would you go about sending traffic to it? It's organic. So, I think that's it would links, right? Links in bio, this and that. Uh, you know, YouTube, there's a Hormosi video where they talk about it, but it's just look at any Hormosi video. They have the two links right above the fold in the description. They have them then in a pinned comment because you want as many opportunities to have CTA and then using actual in the content piece, go and see the comments or do whatever um to do that. Same thing with Instagram store. Whatever you guys I'm sure understand that. But best for high ticket info, what the best funnel is. I think Yeah. Good. I think that that's just like a flawed way of thinking. I agree. There's not like a best anything. There's people who make every single kind of funnel that there is work. So, it's more so like what is your offer? What are competitors doing? You know, how good are you at different pieces? and just, you know, not looking at it so binarily. You know, I think you you you look at like funnels that work and you assume, oh, someone just had an idea and just made this funnel and now it's working. But it's just really never like that. It's like you try your funnel, figure out where it's broken, look at the stats at different steps in different stages in different places, try and figure out what's not good about it, what needs to change about it, and then um you know, you make one work is more so what you're looking for. Um there isn't like just a best funnel. Uh I think that definitely you should have you should have a VSSL ingredient in it. Like so there has to be a strong message but how that gets delivered can be in a million different ways in my opinion. I have such a different opinion. So do you what do you have? Yeah probably there are good funnels and especially for high ticket organic best I mean webinar and VSSL you probably can do both of them super well. Um that's so funny. Exactly. Mine is completely you can do both of them super well. Yeah. But like you can do DTA super well. You could do a regular webinar funnel super well. You could do you could do every funnel super well. So depending on if you run B2B or your offer is B2B, right? Like what we saw let's say whenever we run something B2B and the price point starts at like we need to argue with each other. Um let's say it starts at 10K. Whenever we ran the VSSL fun uh and it was organic like it still didn't convert very well. The moment we had all the leads sign up for like the weekly webinar, they do it live so it's a hustle. A lot of people don't like doing them. uh live but the those calls that come from the webinar like after listening to you live like it's so different when you are live on just a pre-recorded VSSL the intent of those people on the clos rate is like just way way higher than any VSSLs we see and we see that now now we start doing this for one of our business yeah but the guy asking this question can be really good at sales he could be and like weak at marketing or weak at tech and like you know that that's what I'm saying with like the best thing it's more like self assessing what you're good at not good at what what was your idea Ryan? Best organic. So depending on I mean of course all this can be depending on or or this or that or what is best to you but generally speaking if someone has consumed x amount of information already on you and consumption and consumption and consumption because they're watching long form YouTube or whatever they're basically teed up. So it is a very that's why a lot of the time these guys can run the simplest two p three-page funnel. So you could like Luke said DTA. So someone's going to a headline a short form VSSL again they've already consumed. So you can have the apply button right there testimonial wall all the things they fill out the application do your routing and do your qualification in that then they go book a call. I'm a huge fan of book a call. I think it's more agree with that. I think it's more evergreen. I mean it is more evergreen like inherently because if you do stuff like events or launches or whatever it's like if you're booking those to calls you need however many the volume that you need in sales availability on calendars when you do events that go to a calendar ising insane. you need like a lot, right? Like we know guys who do 30 40 sales reps that are like on hire to just come in for that and just come in to then set because then there's drop and like that just sounds like a mess to me. So evergreen organic, I would do it to a DTA unless you can make the offer sexier, which is like something that you have that's gated, that's free, that's low ticket, because you're going to get more people generally speaking to do that and get the next intention step down the line and then go into a book a call, right? But you can only do DTA if you have a like if you can tie a promise to your offer like I'll help you do X Y. No, I think with organic organic can be very little. Well, let's say they're consuming you. It's a bizop offer. Okay. But like promises and bizop are like super sketchy like you can't really like you get in a lot of trouble promising stuff. But if they're like really warm audience, I think you're right. Teed up like easier the better is probably a better place. like [ __ ] put them in your DMs and just get them on the phone. Yeah, I'm not a super fan of that DM, but a lot of people crush DM setting. So like I started talking to a lot of coaches and follower ads to DM. Yeah. Well, that's the same thing as that's what I was saying about the free group funnel. So you basically have like get them the next step in the consumption level or like with intention. So it's either they're DMing you now and there's communication, they're in a free school group, Facebook group [ __ ] they're doing something, they're w even the opt into a free training, but then there's so much more [ __ ] you need like automations, you need flows, you need this, you need that, you need to like get like just a mess versus if it's like simple, it's like this to apply, they apply, they qualify, they get on a phone call, and it's like we were talking to a guy at the event that has a 90 something% uh show rate and a 50% close rate on like a mid ticket over the phone because they're soing warm because they're coming. So, it really depends on a lot of things. We were both talking about paid funnels. Yeah. Yeah. So, all right. Next one on here. if you're getting uh started on a brand new publishing offer. So, which means like partnering with an expert or whatever basically. So, you're the marketer and you're partnering with someone who's like the expert. What would be your recommendations and tips for taking it to over a million ASAP? Um I'm going to let you start with that. I meant model. Yeah. Um me and a friend of mine that's like one of the best copyriters I know um have been thinking of yes client work great but we were like okay what can be a client that will make us a boatload of money and we started talking to some people like we put some criterias in place they are not probably very well defined but I would not try to go build an offer that like there's not already someone doing let's say let's say my goal is a billion% like my first thing like yeah if there was no one having that offer at a million a month. I would not take that client on. Is he talking about a million or a million a month? Uh I'm just going to say I'm sure, but I'm just going to say let's sprint to a million. Maybe say a million month. Same. I mean same [ __ ] It's one's just like how fast like you know. Um if there's not anyone there, I need to see what's the organic already like cuz like you really want to take a publishing offer. One of the easiest thing like oh it depends. Is he asking in the case of like you you know the offer and you just need an expert in the space or do you is he already an expert in the space? he makes some sales, but like you want to take him to that. So, usually these publishing offer guys are like, "Oh, I found this expert and I know I could figure out something." So, I'm sure they have some ideation that's already occurred around what the offer is, but they they generally speaking, they'll have some like audience already because they're an expert and whatever a little bit, not some massive audience. Some of these guys snipe like guys who have, you know, 300,000 or girls, whatever that, you know, a big following but have no monetization like offer model. Um, so yeah. What do you think? it was the what was the first thing that I would do? Yeah. If you're just getting started, what would your recommendation and tip be to scaling it to a million ASAP? Um, my recommendation and tip, depending on where the person is at and what they and what they understand. This is hard without context. No, you did it. You did it. What I would do is I would, you know, uh, context here. Luke did this exact business model and then I came in as essentially like number four or five. So Luke took somebody that was uh had no following really and then but was like an expert like a true expert in the niche and did this model except we fumbled and bumbled our freaking asses off to get to where we are today in that. So like based on those learnings how would you launch that now? Same way you talk about your XYZ new idea. How would launch it now? You know build figure out the message the market make sure there's a big problem number one. Make sure the person's good on camera. Uh, start with like the sales message in my opinion. So like some sort of VSSL, get that right. Use it on organic if they already have an audience. Um, and then once that's working, begin to build out everything. So then you start to build out the funnels and you start to build out, you know, customer support, sales team, make sure fulfillment's all good. They have to be in fulfillment. Um, and yeah, you know, yeah, that was key is in the beginning it was in fulfillment. Whether that's in product like pre-recorded fulfillment or that's like sell first for sure and then do it. But like either in there or the coaching, it's generally really helpful to be able to sell the person and like their expertise directly in the beginning. Um, the other piece that I was I completely agree. I always model everything. So like if I was to do this right now and I've talked about this on here and I always use as the example, but the life insurance one I would pick like I know three or four that already do it. I would go bump bump bump. I would have a little hedge. Actually, I would probably have multiple experts unless I found someone who's like a rockstar because I don't want the hedge of doing that, which when you're starting is probably harder, but and I would just run a gambit. I know three of them that crush it right now. They have one of them that's organic, one of them that's all paid, one of them it's a mix, which is hilarious. Um, and yeah, and they just absolutely crush it. So, I would just literally take what they do. I would model it off there. I would create the brand asset that made it look like it was, you know, polished, even though you don't even need that. And then I would just run it right off again. So, exactly what they're saying. I can add one last thing. Um, make sure you agree with them for them to keep pushing organic, especially in the first month because one of let's say most cases those people either run some ads or like or like no ads at all. So the moment you start spending on ads cuz like that's probably how you'll uh try to get the offer to work if they do not push organic and did not get sales consistently end like the relationship is just terrible. Yeah. No, agreed. Um I Josh Gavin I always [ __ ] plug him in this so shout out him. He owes me like 30% of his business. But um just kidding Josh I love you. Um but he does this exactly. He has an entire framework on how to do this. We actually talked with him like he almost in my opinion I've said this to him but like doesn't I feel like he has such good ones like that he's partnered with or built that he could take it so much further on like one or two of them versus having so many but he like both teaches people how to do it and then has some of his own. He owns all the IP. He owns the everything. It's literally the experts like part of it and it's a great business model. So I mean run it but you could probably find some resources from him too. So um next one there was probably YouTube more. How are you leveraging AI to better inform your media buying strategies? Oh okay that's a pretty good question. Um I am not doing let's say the dayto-day on this but um Vlad and other guy they've been producing with creatives non-stop. Yeah, I mean for for you guys as well like when we don't want to necessarily ask Lara to do something like just go like I can probably pull Slack right now the travel plague we have like 10 ads that were down like last couple of days just with AI generation. Mhm. You guys have a dedicated Slack channel in our Slack channel. No, like a two-way uh like me, him, and Vlad. Yeah. See, it's got to change. Got to change. We need eyeball. You you you Blake and Vlad. Yeah. Yeah. See, that's got to change. This is where we learn this [ __ ] I hate when people have this happened like three times in the last two months. People talk about something and they have a direct message between like two people or I'm sorry like three people or like six, seven people and I'm like make it into a channel. Put us in it. I'll mute it, but I I want eyes. Okay, fair enough. So, uh Blake, sorry for uh telling everyone that we have our own channel. Maybe that's considered micromanaging. It's probably considered micromanaging. Maybe I need to grow. Um we do a lot of the copy uh now with AI like whenever like we take a new project like we have let's say a warrior babe um project file in our DVD. You said the company name. Yes. Uh oh you're totally fine. Okay. Um, we produce copy like Blake sometimes ask like, "Hey, can we do this ad here?" But like try the strategy where we have like 21 ad copies and like in the normal scenario like it would take us, I don't know, um, two or three hours to produce 21 like a couple minutes and like we just revise everything. Good because we prompt the AI so well and give him all the context on the off like all the little details and like we don't give all that information like just freaking throw it one time like you talk with the AI in the beginning just make sure all the points are good from there spits copy so okay so that's copy that's creative what about actual media buying because I've seen Vlad send us stuff where it's like reporting or like finding quick things and I I have one on this but what about actual media buying um most of the stuff we do is exports from then experts from Facebook and combine that data Um, we don't have like AI agents yet. Even if Mark is like, "Dude, like I don't get it. Like, why you still do media buying?" Like, "You can have AI manage everything." But it's like, "Yeah, well, it's not it's not as simple." You're like, "Mark, you pay me to do media buying. What do you mean?" It's not as simple just because when you have third party tracking system in like most cases like Hyros is there like it's so hard to actually make sure the data is correct and like it's pulled the right way and like decisions are made the right way. Um, especially when we manage how much we manage a day like whatever let's say I c spend 30 50k a day like it's so risky to just give it to AI yeah like those people are paying [ __ ] done and like we don't want to delegate that um one thing that I saw some media buyers do they just have alerts like on the the agent always analyzes the data and if one of the KPI like I don't know CPM skyrockets or your caser call just tanks like you get an alert so like you have eyes on Like that's probably something we would do. Yeah. I was on uh uh Nick Fischer, shout out, he's a [ __ ] legend. Um but he was talking about it like two weeks ago. I was on one of the calls with him and he talked about I think it's that magics or whatever that thing is. So I don't know how much cuz they've had those forever like the automated reporting and same thing like the action flows, the rules, the all that stuff. Um, but there's some layer, and I'm not familiar with this because I don't actively media buy right now, but the they have a ton of [ __ ] set up in there that does like alerts and like auto turn offs and like does things and it also pulls data from other sources. So, it's like a twofold. Um, but they use that um on let's just say very very large like you know nine figure info companies. I didn't use matrix in a while but their integration with always used to suck. Yeah, that's that was like my thing. Ah, for the guy. Yeah. Yeah. because like he needed higher data to trust on the page. Yeah, I don't know their data sources on it, but he was like sharing all the stuff and had like nine tabs open. Yeah. So, all right. Um, next one on here in ecom. I've always thought about it. That's 95% product and creative. Okay. Well, 95% 95% product and creative and then 5% is media buying campaign setup or whatever. Would you agree or disagree and why? Great products with great creative seem to always do well regardless of media buying strategy, but I may be overlooking its importance. So there's a whole like clicking the buttons versus Right. Yeah. What do you think on that? [Music] Yeah. I I'd say like pro I think like what product and creative definitely is important, right? And uh if creative means like matching a market with a good message that resonates with it. I think that's always more important. As you begin to spend more, you have more, you know, that has to happen inside ad accounts with like, you know, overseeing stuff like that. that but I think yeah 100% you have to basically basically what he does it's useless no no you have to have good market good message resonance you have to have a good product of course and then like you know if you really hit a really good one you have a big tailwind um yeah so I agree with like the sentiment of the question yeah I do not agree with the ratio of importance 955 yeah cuz we have like one of my closest friends I was telling yesterday at the gym. uh has like a ecom brand that probably very soon he'll do like 2 million pounds a month uh in the UK and he does Amazon does Tik Tok shop but never cracked ads then now all of his ads are actually the winners from the like from their Tik Tok shop campaigns like the winners they run them as ads like dude like why do they print so much money on Tik Tok but they're not printing here it's like do you want me to give you one more try on Facebook because like they had a lot of agencies with the same creatives and we are crushing ing it and all the other agents with the same exact ads didn't do anything. H. So maybe like 7525 but then but then like but then like if something's set up fundamentally wrong it could be completely like if you like you know if you're like 5%. Yeah. I don't know if it's time. I don't know if it's focus. I don't know what percentage optimization. We we had a call the other day with we have friends that do 15 million a month with essentially one hero skew and they have like a couple ancillary stuff but they are crushing in like MRR game and he literally was like we have one media buyer who pops into here and like it is he basically was the 5 to95 approach like in his mind right you know and again he already knowing how to do it though like you have to [ __ ] know how to do it like setting up the account correctly having your pixels correct they were doing crazy [ __ ] with like not not day partying necessarily, but like they were like same day. They were almost like uh what do you call it? Uh what surfing? They were almost like surfing in there. Yeah. He's like, "Oh, we'll turn off this and this and then we'll ramp into these and find these pockets." And they're spending across Tik Tok, um Facebook, I'm sorry, Meta, and a little on Google. I'm sure on Google, but yeah, that was the two course. So, okay. Um yeah, we I talk about on here all the time though. If there is a landing page, for example, that is the ugliest, worst thing ever, but has the best offer or copy or whatever on it and the [ __ ] button doesn't work to purchase, but you have your address on there, people will mail you to try to buy your [ __ ] You know what I mean? Like, it kind of gets out of that. So, truly, yeah. Or Naval has the quote like, you know, you only need whatever mark. I don't know. I'm going to botch this, but it's like you only need uh sales if you if if your product's not good enough, you need sales. If your sales isn't good enough, you need marketing or whatever it is. But basically all to say like if your product's so [ __ ] good that you don't even need marketing and sales then yes like that's the number one thing. So next on here for the people without metar is there any truth in page BM and ad account trust scores that affect your CPMs? If so when is it time to shift pages ad accounts and BMs and signs from something external um that is ex uh or signs something external is affecting your ads other than its natural performance. Had a friend of mine switch ad accounts and performance improve. So wondering your thoughts on extern external factors. Love your work. Ryan, Luke, and M. Yeah. Um, it is all three names. Thank you, brother or sister. No, like literally, it's probably a sister. It's a It's a tough question just because we have some other accounts where, for example, the page health was trash. It's like, okay, let's spin up this other pages um that like we would manually farm the game. Start at the front. So which ones can you see? You can see page quality. You can see account quality. Can you see account? Can you see and you can see ad page quality and account quality. If you're going business support home like that that will show like how many ads rejected you have like if your account is at risk. Um and most of the time when we try to change those assets like it never changes anything account. Yes. Like let's say in terms of oh like I launched my CPM was 200 bucks and I I went through this whole rabbit hole and trying to figure out like why the CPM is so expensive and it's almost every single time the creative or the copy on the landing page like if Facebook thinks like whatever you're doing there like ah sketchy whatever like they will give it the most expensive CPM but like I I tend to look now at CPM like as such as a vanity metric because I really care about like how much it costs for someone to land on my page like per outbound click. So as long as that one's in line and I have one campaign has 200 CPM but at the other like 20 but the cost for outbound click is the same. I don't really care about what my CPM is and you optimize around I mean your true true your rorowaz obviously. Yeah, like everything the highest tracks will be like the metrics I guide myself in. All the Facebook ones are vanity metrics, but we have for example a lot of trading offers and the CPM on them is like 200 bucks and everyone panics like the guys coming the account like guys like what are we doing wrong? The CPM is 200. It's like yeah but your customer buck is like four bucks for an offer that's 15k. Yeah. Have you run a lot of trading offers? A couple. Have you? Mhm. Trading boss especially. So like direct to car um trading boss like you sell the license for about 15k. Interesting. Yeah. So it's direct application qualified people that have 50k. I had I had Ahmad on here um Amed I'm sorry Amad on here and uh he we was just at the event. You guys got to connect. He does all organic but he crushes and he only does this. Is it trading offer or he only does trading offers? No, no, he's not a he's not a trader. He's like a he's like a growth operator style which I'm butchering probably what it's called. Um but yeah. And then he So if you're watching this one, hit me up where I'll like the girls are that that were sitting next to you at dinner yesterday. Those like he they're a client. Oh, okay. I remember. Um yeah, my I I hang out with some lead genen guys or have really in the past and they'll swap all of these if I'm being honest. So they will have mult like it's every variable. It's the credit card that's on file. I mean it's both like a risk of the accounts too. So it's the credit card on file. It's the ad account. It's the pixel. It's the links the domain. It's the uh copy on the lander. It's the creative. Like it's literally everything could be a variable. If you're running like normal stuff though, yeah. I mean test swapping them out. I don't know why you wouldn't. Yeah. And dedicate and just like if you have two different ones, literally load the same stuff into the next one. Does it perform the same? Like it's very common to test that before you need to go and try and test everything. It's like if you're doing everything, you know, basically to the book, which everyone tries to do, most of people try to do everything to the book, but like just swap out an ad account, swap out swap out a page. And then that's the other thing. It's like rather than even having the question, it's like just just in one hour get a new ad account set up and cross it off the list. And yeah, and optimize for like uh like optimize for rorowes. Like we know people who have $300 whatever $250 CPMs that like the rorowaz still backs out and it's like obviously not super ideal if like you know in comparison, but like who cares? Like why would it matter? So um next one more of a marketing question. Yeah. Uh, how to increase your front-end AOV for a product where quantity breaks don't make sense compared to an easily bundable bundleable product. Aside from positioning it through gifting, raising price, adding free gifts. Uh, example, the Nuru foot massager compared to say a security camera that would make sense to have multiple. Like, how would you position it to triple the front end AOV? So, something that's really like a one-time thing that doesn't make sense to have more than one directly. How do you do that? Um, do you do any of that? Do you have that conversations with people about that stuff? No, but we actually have two clients now that that's very relatable for um most of the time it's about the funnel that they run. Like most people run like the side of ecom is like you just run to your Shopify their like product page where um you run the traffic to the Shopify uh main page. But the main main way I'm seeing people have like crazy high is the process you take the prospect first. So if I'm sending traffic first to like a VSSL and we're running the ads for like we're trying to figure this out like why I'm not sure like why it's so freaking hard. Um but like one of the biggest offers on ClickBank. It's a supplement offer. We're running the ads for them and all the traffic is being sent to your VSSL and after that VSSL like we offer bundles. the biggest one and the most taken one is eight bottles of that freaking supplement which is what like six month offer or three month offer I think it's six months. So our AOV is about one is very common by the way which I actually didn't realize until like a year more of the same like more of the same. So he's he's basically saying the opposite of that. He's saying it's something that isn't more of the same. Well, if it's not more of the same than something tertiary, like something that makes sense to have with a foot massager. Maybe there's like a [ __ ] oil or like a a hand massager or like a neck massager or like a neck handed foot massager super pack the premier version. No, like the my simpleton brand right now and I've only run a little bit of ecom said something so inappropriate. Uh my only like is is literally just like the exactly what they're saying the funnel type. So like all the post-purchase stuff that's either that's ancillary, that's the next step in the journey, that's the add-ons, that's the whatever because it doesn't just have to be on page and positioning as gifting and just more of the same. Like you can have all other SKs like that company I was talking about that does 15 million. Like they have their hero skew. It's all their creative. It's all their everything. They run to that, but the only amount that is going to ever occur on the first page of the checkout or the first order directly is going to be whatever it is, 50 bucks or whatever dollar value. Then there's post-purchase upsells. I don't I'm pretty sure at this point they don't do pre purchase because again that affects like conversion rate and stuff and I don't 100% know and you can play with that but like the post-purchase [ __ ] is just like increase AOV add-ons that don't ever affect a guide like a foot guide. Yeah. 100% margin. Um yeah, if it's um we we talk about with Mark about this triple your AOV is wild. That's what he said. I mean, triple your AOV because actually I think he'll listen to my first answer and he'll be like, "Dude, but that's not what I'm looking for because like you cannot really sell more foot massage uh like whatever those are cuz like you probably need one, right?" So, probably the only way you would increase your You get one for a friend. Well, that's what you said without doing it through gifting, raising price and gifts, free gifts. But why not tertiary products? tertiary products and but why not increase your price cuz like maybe if you have a VSSL to like induction them so good or like an adverttorial page to like the copy is so good like you can probably charge more for the same exact that's true I did a drop shipping fund test at the end of 2024 and I did like 100 grand a month and uh hardwood floors or what was it floors or something no it was like a dog product and uh I had I got one of those Shopify apps that did split testing on page for prices and or not on page just split testing in general. Um, and I tested like whatever $79 and I tested one at like $119 and it's in it's insane. It tracks like the full throughput and then also like the AOV stuff on the back on the upsells and like total total card amount and it obviously had like a lower take rate, but it actually one of the tests I did had such a vast thing and it was like basically showed it as premium instead of making it like more commoditized and it actually had a better return. So, we ended up landing on the one that was hundred and something dollars. But again, very small test, but like you just got to test stuff like that. And then I I agree tertiary stuff is is the obvious way, the obvious way. Um, and any any MR function, I don't know how gray area you want to be, but you can do subscription stuff. Uh, you can do community based stuff that's included in there, depending if it's community, it could be community focused. Uh, you can do add-ons for shipping stuff that's the same ship. You know, you can do a lot of ways to do that. But I mean, one of the biggest ecom hacks that I know of um is whatever your uh whatever your product is, just sell it and don't ship it. I I heard it increases margins a lot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, that's a great advice. Yeah. Um you heard it here first. Ecom question. Oh, another ecom question. Okay. Um I'm sure you've answered this before, but how to handle the fluctuations in results, especially when you're testing on [ __ ] campaigns? Example, you test a VSL for three days at $100 and you have a 1.5K 1.5x KPI per day and then 20 to 30% net each day. So you bump to 200. Okay. So you're basically consistent for three days at 100 bucks the next day. So you bump it to 200 and for another from 100 100. Yeah. 20% net each day. Yeah. So you bump to 200 results tank. It's a very large TAM and the offer with large TAM script hook targeting. So not sure why increase in spend has such a large drop off. What factors could cause such steep performance decline when doubling test budgets? So yes, he was doubling his test budget after three days. I mean, first one, I'm actually not um disconidering doubling budgets when you're spending only 100 because the budget is not even that big. Um there might be a couple of things like one, your ad account is not actually primed to spend huge amounts. So probably one thing you can do if you can afford it, try your test at a higher budget so you don't have to increase every single time because I I met a couple of guys recently that their whole philosophy on running ads was if a campaign works don't touch the budget like just let it run and like make your changes at the ad level like if something tanks but don't change the budget which in some accounts makes so much sense because like I I know exactly like the type of accounts you mentioned because like sometimes like you bump the budget like 50 bucks and like it goes to [ __ ] and it was like a winner the day before like the week before like the first budget bump you have like it just tanks. So like if you're seeing that behavior a lot in the account, try some of your tests at the bigger budget or let's say if your campaign runs super well at 100, maybe just duplicate that campaign and try it at the budget you want to increase it without cannibalizing the first one. That's an option. And for if you if that doesn't work, try to change the ad copy at the creative level just so you don't have overlap. We asked uh Blake this when he was on, but what is like your overall like creative to scaling process like testing to scaling? Um like you're launching I mean I don't want to say but I mean [ __ ] a fresh account like what's your campaign structure? What's your launch strategy to creative once you find winners? What do you do with them? Do you scale them? Do you launch a different campaign that's scale campaigns or like proven? Usually the structure we have recently is creative testing campaign, copy testing campaign with the winner creatives and we just try to squeeze as much juice out of that one as possible. And probably in most of the accounts we run right now. Those are like some of the best performing campaigns. the copy testing with the existing winner creatives scaling campaign which is usually like just a CBO structure uh like one open adset one look alike of your like purchasers uh and just slam all your best performing creatives in there um and then sometimes we just do weird tests but like does don't necessarily have like some deep meaning but we just test for the sake of testing because like some of the most random tests like work the best. Yeah. What's your biggest account right now you're spending daily? It dropped a bit. It used to be 100K, now 70K a day in ecom. So, um, low ticket front end actual product. No, really. Mhm. All right. We need to talk about that. Um, all right. Next one. I want to build an info product course. We're getting into a couple days ago now, so or kind of yesterday. Uh, I want to build an info product course teaching other agencies how to sell and fulfill high ticket web design. Can you spitball on this idea what you do to offer as an order bump Otto ascension? Should I just make a school? I' I've done my math and I think it works. How can I test this idea to see if it has legs about building the entire funnel products and putting a ton of money into it? So, he wants to take he wants to basically create a course, not coaching, uh, to teach agencies how to do high ticket web design. So, how would you launch it? Is it with a low to get funnel? It sounds as it because I think he's assuming because it's direct to cart because he wants to do just a course instead of coaching which honestly in my opinion is actually or you go ahead actually you go ahead if you're trying to test the idea. I mean, yeah, you're trying to test the idea to see if it has legs without building an entire funnel products or putting money into a ton of money. The most obvious thing would be see if somebody's already doing that and if someone's ads have been running for a long time, then you know it works. And then uh and then yeah, then build out all the marketing first. I would say rather than building out the whole entire thing and then it never even working, no one even wanting it. Try with you know the marketing, the sales, the pages, the ads. See if that works first and then if it does then build it. Yeah, literate funnels too. Like if you try to build them from scratch are a freaking beast. Like it's not that easy. It's probably easier to figure out the VSSL funnel than get fun, dude. I talk about it all the time on here. I was like I would I don't think I would ever launch low ticket first for the amount of iteration and back and forth and trying to get it right and the pieces and parts it requires, the assets on page. Like I hate that stuff. So I would do I would honestly do a callunnel is what I would do. % 100% I would do and I would probably do a DTA because you get more volume for a cheaper cost. Uh which does not necessarily mean a good thing because they likely have lower consumption if they go through other funnels, but you need to like talk to people and like be able to have the room for error and noodle room to like to be able to do it. Get people on the phone that are in your market as fast as you can and then rather than guessing what they want, you're just talking to them. Yeah. And so because you're teaching people because you want to build an info that teaches other agencies, which is very interesting, uh how to sell and fulfill. So the beauty of having a a niche like that is you also don't necessarily have to run ads. Uh it's way easier to do something like outreach. Um I don't know if I like that idea to be honest. What outreach? No, it's like having agencies. He doesn't like your idea. Um I Yeah. Well, it's like cuz then the agency has to I mean maybe it makes it really easy for the agency and it's an add-on and it's a good idea. what I think is irrelevant. I could be completely [ __ ] wrong. And the other side of this is if you have a great fulfillment team, it could almost you could just do this as a partnership thing and you could teach other agencies how to sell it and then you could fill spread. Yeah. That would be the way to do it because then there's no increase for them. Yeah. So, you have a sexier offer because it's like, hey, it's basically white labeling you guys as a service. You're teaching them how to sell it. You show them the benefits of it. You show them how much money they can make on it. And then for you sell it to them for five, they sell it to their client for 10. And then it costs Yeah. They sell for whatever they want. And then you make the spread there. Yeah. And then you get more efficient with that and you just become the fulfillment god of, you know, these websites. Very very good take on this. I know someone not in the web design space but has a one of the biggest SEO agencies. Yeah. Oh, you know. No, no. I just I've heard of this before. I almost did this like [ __ ] probably eight years ago now. This carpet was made to get ash. We were at We were at agency founders and when the guy I mean the company is called Search Atlas like I can do some free promo. Um, and they have two options. So, they are they're one of the biggest SEO agencies out there. And offer number one, they build a software like an AI software, whatever that like makes it so easy for you to fulfill on SEO. So, that's offer number one. They just teach you how to use their software. They have courses. They do like weekly, monthly coaching. Um, the second thing is like, yeah, you learned this, but you're too lazy, but you can definitely upsell your existing clients to do SEO work for them. You just white label them. Yeah. But yeah, like they they run ads to get people on like to teach them how to make money with SEO like as an upsell. So it's pretty much the same exact thing. Just your thing is website design. I would do that. I like that idea. Especially if you're talking about fulfilling on high ticket, high ticket, and all this stuff is like premium, and then you're trying to sell some low ticket thing and like a send that like I Yeah, cuz if you're going to if you're going to try and sell something that's like mid ticket essentially, which is like, you know, a 1 to 2k style offer anyway, it's going to be something that is more you're going to need like a a bigger process. You're going to need a webinar, you're going to need VSSL, you're going to need to go through that whole thing. So, let's start there. Next one. What's your follow-up process look like? Uh like duration, no show, all of that. Um, I'm I'm starting to get in a couple days back, so I actually might cut this here soon. Um, yeah, because the rest of these are all questions basically for me, and I don't really want to Yeah, these ones don't really make sense for these guys here. So, all right, we'll wrap it at that. Um, or actually, let me see if there's one more in here. I have a good follow-up process. What's your follow-up process look like? Duration. So, after no show, we dial them. We text them every single day for 30 days straight. Example, like what? So, what's our follow-up process look like? Sorry, people walked in here. I think the key the key with follow-up process is just having one. You know, it sounds sounds sounds oversimplified, but just like having a process and then people way underestimate how important the systems and processes you have once you have and paid for a lead are. Like it's like, you know, hypothetically it's like it's like, oh, we're good at ads, but like all of our ads would [ __ ] break immediately if we didn't have all of this [ __ ] behind it where, you know, you're squeezing all of the juice out of the lemon. Like, so, you know, I would say just, uh, aim on having more than you think you need. Uh, and then just cover all the fronts. So, all the obvious ones. And you can just think logically like if you want someone to get on a call, they probably should have a text for that like on like the data part of the reminders. If you want to warm them up, like there's nurture sequences. So in between the point of when they book a call and then when they get on the call, sending them lots of content, testimonials, videos like that. Um you know, there's there's Yeah. So aim for more than you think that you need and then just try and cover all of the things like look around. what are all the best practices and then just put them all in there because it's really important and I would probably try to funnel hack companies that rely heavily on ads and that are super successful. Those people have their flows dialed in 100%. I mean we yeah we were in courses and funnel hacking and whatever is how we initially got like the bones of all of ours and then you have to obviously change it to your niche or your you know messaging but and then so if you to get technical for you so like if it's VSSL optin funnel you have an optin you have an application you have a book a call and then you have like when the call actually happens and then you have the sale right so I don't have enough fingers but um if so if you go if you go through so we'll have an automation for each layer right so somebody who uh opts in but doesn't apply someone who applies but doesn't book, someone who books before they get on the call, someone who no shows on the call, and then somebody who's, you know, pending or whatever in the deal stage layer. So those are basically across those, you have contextual ones for them for that or promises that you gave them. So if they were at the BSL is like, oh, we're going to, you know, send you bonuses or gifts or whatever. Contextual, contextual. Then on top of that, the reason you do stuff like email, um, and I'm, it's actually the next question, I'll read it, but someone else asked, and this directly connects, um, I've been learning a lot of Alex Becker's content. He advises against using an or he advises to use an opt-in page for high ticket offers. High ticket to cover the ad cost and then make money from the email list. In his words, averaging one to two dollars per email per user for the email list for the month. You use a similar funnel. Did you find that that works? Did you guys make money off the list? Okay. So, one I don't I I please send me this content because I don't know where Becker would use that. It's like that's like affiliate lead genen language usually. Um and you wouldn't want your high ticket to cover your ad costs. It's like it just doesn't sound really direct. But in saying that, high opt-in for high ticket, the reason that we do it or why it really works for us is like exactly what Luke said. So like if we didn't have any email automations, everything would explode because we are capturing the email so that we can do all those contextual automations and then also email them twice a day, every single day, seven days a week for a very long time. Uh sending them content pieces. And for us, we optimize by sending them content pieces that are on the site. And the site itself is like a web of content. So they go for one thing and then once they're there, there's like recommended ones that are similar to this. Uh we do the same thing on text where we'll send them to the site and do things that are contextual to them. So we're constantly pushing them there for consumption because you have their email which is like the smallest level of intent. I mean I guess a click is before that the uh intent then they give the email and then we do all that versus if you go to an application or something you like push them down further. So that's my opinion. Um, hey, not going to read that part out loud. Uh, quick question for someone who runs deep in op space. When you're hiring a real a players, media buyers, real a player, media buyer, especially for YouTube, what are the biggest things you look for? Does industry experience matter? Meaning someone who's crushed a training offer? Do you think that translates well over to like an ecom coaching? Uh, how much weight do you place on platform results versus broader skill? Um, like CRO instincts, funnel diagnostics, etc. Uh, do you expect buyers expect buyers to write the copy themselves or do you or do you have someone to spot? This is like all broken up. Sorry. Um, any red or green flags you've learned to look out for? So, essentially trying to dial in their standards on how they're going to hire for media buyers, which is perfect. And this was asked before I was even here. So, what do you guys think on that? Um, I think, you know, you need to have all of the parts covered. So, you got to have someone who's good at like thinking like CRO, ad copy, creative, and then also media buying. Um, and then it depends if you know how to do it or not, right? If you don't know how to do it, they need to know how to do it. Um, and then in that case, the best thing is always having someone who's already done it, right? Like if you can find someone who's working on, I don't know, 30 other accounts or something like that and they're running Google, you know, and they're doing it successfully and they can pop open or show you just results, you know, you you know they know what they're doing and then figuring out like where their uh capabilities start and stop and then, you know, just addressing it. If if someone's can do it all, then you got someone who who can do it all. And if you have someone who's just a part, then you got to fill in the other parts. So depends on what you know and then what they know and then you know my my take in hiring is we want to try and find people who are already doing it successfully. What about you? I mean you hire media buyers for your team and then you guys act as media buyers for companies. So like one where do you guys draw the line on like what you He can teach them really well though. Yeah. Yeah. Exact. Yeah. That I mean you know like all of our best guys like start pretty much from zero. Yeah. Uh because main thing for me is like to go from zero to one like that one's probably the the most complicated part until like they understand the platform all that stuff but for them to just become super technical analyze the data like that that one I can like I can teach someone to be like top tier talent like we were talking yesterday about like legion but even in the info space info is like very contextual and like you need to understand a lot of strategy until you can be a good media buyer yeah he asked that so like the difference between someone being ecom coaching and training offer so I guess I guess those are both info kind of but like what do you think about info to ecom buyers? It's very different. Very different. Yeah. For direct to cardart essentially if you run ads for an info product you need to understand the strategy super well cuz like if you don't know what to look at like which numbers like what's your actual KPIs what you optimizing for like where do you see the funnel is broken like how do you report it to the client that I think that's super important. the more I think about oh like do you want your media buyer to write your copy uh like help you with the strategy help you with the angles I think media buyers that are really good at buying media but then also are very good at writing copy are like super rare like Blake or Mark they're they're like some of those rare examples when like I can do it all but even in my case like I'm working on my cop game I'm I think I'm pretty good at strategy I think I'm really good at strategy But I don't think I'm that good at copy. So where would So for someone like this, if they're hiring in and they want a media buyer, clearly that's the number one portion of the skill they want, right? Obviously that part's like non-negotiable, but how far I guess it's contextual in the person already, right? It's like you don't even know. You're not trying to find someone who also has this. I mean, you might, but like just look at it like marketing. like you need to find you need to sell marketing and then if that means a media buyer that if it means a media buyer that in my opinion that typically means that you already have the strategy and the creative and the messaging part figured out if if you know so you have to figure out marketing not just one thing but also if you get someone to agree to do for you the copy the angles and the media buying and then retainer wise you offer something super low I can almost guarantee you that yeah you're not getting something no anyone who can actually do do that well is extremely powerful. Yeah, they have the ability to make a lot of money. So, the an interesting thing just to kind of on overall hiring is I've talked about on here we're just now for the first time like hiring people that have hit bigger PRs that have done more like have more experience than we have in something. So, example like you know CMO like has done higher numbers than we have as a company and in the past majority of the company has like grown like we're always doing PRs together like we are always doing PRs together. we haven't done certain things until we've done them internally here. Um they're more expensive. They're like all, you know, go down the list of things, but there's a lot of pros and there's some cons. Um the event we were at uh was talking about how theirs is the exact opposite model. Um like, and again, we're only doing this at like the sea level. We're kind of doing it in other places, but like mainly at the sea level, but they talked about how they go from your approach and essentially like a couple of guys that were on very high level positions in their company were setters that like rose their way up and they teach them things inside there. It's just a different approach. Either is either works, either is right or wrong. The different like procons is like we're paying more, right, than somebody because like just the expectation and like the the growth that occurs when somebody is this in the company and then can grow to this is different than hiring outside talent or poaching or trying to find these people with experience because they either inherently are worth more or they think they're worth more or whatever. Um, so just something to think about. So yeah, I love what Luke said though because it's like you're just trying to plug the gap. Like if you're literally trying to find a medi buyer because you have the other things, find a media buyer. If you're trying to find like if you know, it depends on what you know and what you need for what your current setup is. So I think that's a good one. Um, next one is a novel. So this is all right. Let's rip it. Put it in chatbt. Summarize. No, because it has data. Um, we sell info coaching in the AI space. How to how to that's kind of funny. Uh, how to become a data scientist and how to build AI agents. Um, two mid to mid-t courses. It's pretty I need to buy it. It's pretty profitable on the front end and also around 10% of the midt buyers are buying high ticket. So it is pretty profitable on the front end which is great. Okay, so you're already liquidating fully. 10% ascension rate from mid ticket to high ticket. And I'm constantly thinking about how else we can monetize it. Right now it looks like mid ticket to high ticket. And some stats are we're spending $100,000 a month on the on the mid ticket with the 3x rorowaz direct to cart. Nice. Uh with the webinar funnel it's in the Polish market. We have $100,000 a month on ads and spend $400,000 a month in the US. I don't understand. Oh, spending $100,000 a month on ads is like spending 400k on the month in in the US. Like based on I assume like TAM, but uh we're testing 20 to 30 ads a day to keep the ad spend consistent. 10% of the mid ticket are ascending. Not ad spend costs here because we're upselling existing customers. Yes. Start uh started implementing set or closer strategy to call and follow up. People register the webinar but didn't buy. Booking them for calls to buy head ticket. love to hear your insights on how you think about squeezing the back end even more or utilize our lead flow even better. It's a good one. Yeah, I mean that that that was that was that's that's really it. Like you just have to understand you need to squeeze the squeeze what you have more and just go into it and just figure out every place that you're weak and try and work on that little piece for until it's better and then move on to another piece until it's better. Move on to another piece until it's better. And you know that would be you know high level how you how you make that better. And the other thing would be if you can just increase the ascension rate. Uh obviously that would be huge. Um 10% is super high already though. 10% is mid ticket to high ticket. Uhhuh. So Oh, mid to high. That's not high. Low to low to high. That's that's Yeah. Double high. Yeah. But for Can we do another sparkling water, please? Another one. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. sparking water refill. Um, all right. So, if you go back to the episode that Brooke Hadink is on, he is a class example of this. There's other I don't want to say names. He said his own stuff, so I feel comfortable saying his, but there's other people who do this. They will run mid-t webinar and theirs is a 1 to 2k ticket and they will have a 20 to 45% ascension rate and they do it on the onboarding call. So, like globally to look at this entire thing, if you you need to map everything. So, you need to map front to back. So it's like what is your webinar conversion? What is your like go through the steps every single one map every single one out with every single conversion rate and then once you have them all mapped out it's pulling each one up 1 2 3 whatever and then backing out on the very very end what's LTV right now right and then what's CAC and then do that math and then do your percents across and then find your lifts. So like the one the one piece of it that I was talking about there was making it so your onboarding call or your implementation whatever call that you have get a higher take rate on that whether that's through the sales script whether that's getting more people on the call getting more people to show like either show on the call or book the call like there are so many little conversion steps in between there that that one's a 20 you get to a 25 and the further forward you go in the funnel the and and the more tweaks you make here the more it affects the back end. So something as simple as getting a 5% more conversion rate on your registration page depending will back all the way out massively on what that the the change the LTV to CAC ratio. So like map that whole thing. You should DM me because this is interesting. So DM me on something and then and say that you came from here. Um but there's a million ways to squeeze and then if you're just thinking like big things, it's probably that one in my opinion. It's probably that ascension rate that you guys said, the mid to high because you can really hammer that up if the offer stacks right and then what the offer is structured like depending if you can uh introduce there's a ton of people here that were doing this that opens my mind uh some form of membership recurring something that you have on the back the middleback um or like two different things on the back. Uh, that's [ __ ] huge for LTV because you get a community going, you get a whatever going and you start a couple thousand bucks or whatever and that stacks so quickly and you get So I I would do that. But also, you can also just do more volume. If you're spending if you're getting 3x on the front, like that's pretty insane. So play with it and if it like drops down in half, like make sure your numbers back out to you actually are making more and you're not just doing more work for the same or less because that's [ __ ] not ideal. But I would do that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey Ryan, watch a bunch of your videos. Thanks for the valuable content. I've seen you recommend go publish to go publish a creator and build out systems for them. Uh I'm a total beginner and I see so many necessary skills to stack. What would be your fir Okay, so I'm going to change this question, but essentially what would be and ask you guys, what would be the first skill to stack in order to begin this online journey? Basically, the first skill copy. Think copy. Um, this is very is highly debated, completely unique to the person by the way. But yeah, I agree. Highly debated, completely unique. Like I think you got to assess what are you naturally kind of good at. Like I think the idea that you have to have everything yourself is not true. You can build a team. So like if you're [ __ ] dog [ __ ] with, you know, technical stuff, then like you can find somebody to help you with that. Um, right. But how how do you go about the positions that are not let's say when it comes to like let's say a tag position automation position like if something's done right you say it if it's done not done right you say it right away but when it comes to a copyriter let's say you do go to publishing model and you want to hire that copyriter like if you don't know [ __ ] about copy like the copy can be terrible but like to it sounds good. That's true. That's true. So, if you're trying to make a career out of this, you got to just pull your pants up and just learn it all. To be honest, pull them up. Yeah. Pull your pants up and just learn it all. Start just start anywhere. I would say probably the best would be just follow your interest at the beginning. Like what are you more interested in figuring out is it marketing and ads or is it sales and go super deep into it until you're good enough and then move on to the next thing and the next thing and then if there's anything that you're really not good at, try and find somebody to work with. In my opinion, if I was running like uh you know where I was doing like a ton of this, I would want a team of course. You know what I mean? So, but if like one thing in this whole in the sentence in the question was I'm a complete beginner. Like if you are a complete beginner, I would not start with publishing offers. No. If I I say this on here, my my two things are you either get paid to do it or you pay to do it, right? So, you're either going to buy a course and it is not going to be on learn how to copyright necessarily. It's going to be on some business model, some whatever. And it's going to be every piece of it, just a little. And you're going to get your feed into it. And it's going to be a little bit of tech because you're going to build a couple pages. It's going to be a little bit of sales because you're going to do sales. It's going to be a little bit of media buying or whatever traffic. Like it's going to be that. And then the other option is get paid to do it is you find a specific skill set role that someone is hiring for. Like a lot of ones are a setter that goes into a closer or something like that. And it's like you start in sales. But when you're in there, you understand and start like if you are aware of it or go into it with the intention and you work in some one of these, you see all the other pieces and you do that and you get paid to do it versus I like the other one. I like paying for it and then I actually paid to then and then did the other way, right? Like paid to do it and then started working with these guys and then learned it on the job like every almost everything is either through a paid course. Sure. Some like communities and stuff. um and then doing it literally doing the thing and it's not one specific like they have stacked obviously like skills just naturally stack but like it wasn't specifically like oh I want to learn this at that time at least so that was mine um what is your what's your show up workflow is the closer doing all the work if yes how are you tracking them and do you have triagers um I have a video on this where I talk about this it's called like just look up show rate just search my thing and search show rate but rate seriously yeah but I have one on this cuz and it changes all the time but like at that time the one that we were doing was like a 70s something% show rate and it includes setters it includes these different pieces. Um but the quick of it is all the automated reminders, all the automated emails, everything Luke was talking about with hitting them with content uh both in ads and in email and the other places. Uh the initial dial happens within one uh within like under five minutes where it comes from uh confirmation uh setter that they'll dial and confirm the call. Hey, just want to let you know, you know, this is a Zoom, you know, this is a whatever the time zone. Um, and then the automated texts that come will come from the closer automatically. So, we do make it framed from the closer. We also have some emails that direct come from the closer, but then any of the educational ones that are not like, "Hey, what's up, blah blah blah, like respond to me basically, uh, come from the company branded one. So, we'll use expert name for that." Um, and then the thank you page positioning is like really, really big. And we a lot of time point them back to the thank you page. We do have some dedicated pages that we point them to, but they're like pre-objection blocks that are not necessarily I mean I guess they are a function of it. So I have a whole video on this where I talk about it. So next one. Uh what skills do you think offer the highest leverage for a beginner to learn? I'm just starting out and make money. I've been spending. We already answered this basically. So same thing we said before skill building question. Does one still require? What? It says 1 hour there. Does this one still require man? If maybe not, man. Either way, we're close. So, all right. Either way, I think we're out of questions anyway. So, we just Is this yours? This is yours. So, we just hit maybe a cap on this. And if we did, and if we didn't, we don't know. So, Oh, no. It's going up now. It's now it's just in minutes. Oh. Oh, okay. So, we're going. These guys scared. These guys scared me. All right. Um I don't I don't think there's other ones in here. I mean, there are a couple, but is there any that's like like more about like like people and thinking [ __ ] Why is that what you know about? Yeah. Yeah, Luke has evolved to being people in thinking, which is honestly very fair. Um, I don't know. No, I mean, there's nothing specific to that. The I mean, those are all the questions from today. Now, I just have the ones that happen through the week. Let's do one more good one. They're all about they're the me, their tech stack, their ops, their automations, their tracking systems, their I'm a 20-year-old setter and how do I evolve into this? So, I'll get you guys on the next one and I'll make sure I get these on here. Um, any other closing questions, fun things? I mean, if you have something about people that you want to teach people about. What do you want to teach people about? Off the rip. Off the rip. Off the rip. Man, it's not really off the rip. You brought it up, you know. It's like, yeah, off the rip. So, let me look at my notes. Yeah. I would say like you know in like all these questions just like under like you know thinking of like thinking of like why you're asking the thing in the first place and then making sure you're like you know uh considering who you are and what you can do and what you're good at and what you're trying to do and whatever it is that you're trying to do. I think that people don't do that enough. It's like you look around you're like oh this person's doing this and there's money and then this is this and there's this funnel type and there's this this. But I think a lot of a lot of I think progressing in business is like what am I good at? What can I do? What do I understand? Um and yeah, can I ask you a question? Yesterday at the gym you said something that was really the opposite of what I was thinking. Yeah. Um like my perspective on like building a business like I first need to be freaking great at that specific thing like an absolute beast. Then I know like if I get people under me like I would have the respect from them cuz like I'm so good at the thing. But you said like oh like if I would have to start from scratch like I can build any business. Mhm. Even a business that's like I'm not an expert on and the my question was how and why do you think people do you agree with that first? Continue. Do you agree with it that I that we could build anything? Yeah. Yes. But I also know me and I know that I would literally But just just just just the concept the concept but how I would how I would approach it is probably different than I think how you would. Yeah. Because I would I would psychopath like let's say we pick whatever like I need to like become whatever it is. So if it's like whatever industry or niche like I need to understand it so well so that I can do what you're talking about like certain skills specific like yes I know enough about this or enough about this and generally speaking we probably do it like I think we understand at some level we only know this much but like we understand some of the fundamental stuff that it would translate but like whatever the industry specific is I would go so deep. Yeah. So deep. Yeah. like understanding like dude the respect the respect no not a good thing like the literal minute detail I would go to conferences I would watch every [ __ ] course every YouTube video I'd listen to every podcast where someone's talking about some nitty-gritty thing about a home service thing that is completely different that I wouldn't know about because I do think the respect thing is [ __ ] real yeah I I I think that um if I was in it if I was just someone can respect you without you having to have intricate details on what the thing is. Yeah. And that's what a little bit why you and I are different. But like also like I mean think like private equity play. It's like I don't you know they understand the math and they understand the business model and whatever. Do they understand maybe some minute detail? They make the most money out of everyone in the world. Yeah. But if we're talking about operating versus owning is different. So if we're talking about like owning it and owner operating it versus just like owning it as like you know a cash flow or whatever, it's just different. It just depends. But like I I I generally speaking approach things a little bit more like I need more information before I do something generally speaking than someone like you. Well, I definitely still need more information, want more information. I'm just saying like more more like the consumption level that I would go through is more. Yeah. I mean I like how I think of it is I would get all the consumption of the stuff that I needed to get the consumption on. But I think that like if you like if you want to build a company and then like you kind of know you can build a company because you understand the company or you understand like I mean you look at like an e-commerce business you look at like an info business you look at like whatever it's on the internet I think there's a lot of [ __ ] that's [ __ ] relatively 100% very the same businesses are people then you have operations you have marketing you have sales you have the product that's kind of the same thing everywhere um and then you know How I think of growing companies and businesses is like um first having a really big vision like that helps. You have to have the belief that you can build something big and then it's got to be big enough to where people that are talented can like fit into it and reach their own self goals like self-actualize inside of what it is that you're trying to do. And then you bring everybody together and then you know my frame of mind is always like how can I get everyone around me paid and successful and align incentives. And if you do that that drives human behavior. So if somebody has a skill set and the incentive is aligned and you just have hey here's a target destination and if everybody does this then there's these incentives that you all get that you all want. then you know you don't need to know you don't need to know a lot you know I mean like and here's the the other thing there is like I feel like I kind of know I know I know a good amount of of how [ __ ] how an internet company works so like that's part of where that comes from I always for whatever reason literally I said home services when I said my thing but like there's some industries where I'm like I have no idea but like internet business yeah it's there's a lot of so why a home service business is [ __ ] crazy is because of the internet part like that's how those things are scaling and then you just find someone who totally understands how to fulfill on the home service part. Bing, bang, boom. And then their rev share partner. There's no [ __ ] way in hell that they could get to where you were trying to get to without the internet part working and the CRM and the digital part and the sales part and the marketing part. And then it's like, hey, can you go build a $400 million flooring company that could sell without this? No. We need you to [ __ ] nail fulfillment. Boom. Yeah. So, he needs a full-on operator that actually understands the business and just wants to do the internet part and like the people on the team in the company side because Yeah, because you need someone who literally does understand all of the [ __ ] and like there is going to be this a little bit 100% if this person is having XYZ and oh my gosh and the show up or whatever and this person has to drive to the physical location and someone's car and like all this stuff like that doesn't matter once you're like here. Yeah. But that's just understanding one process and then an operator is just like making sure that one process is getting done. Yeah. And the 900 processes inside the process. Yeah. Which is the same as everything like there's 900 pro. So it's just another operator making sure process different than our current understand where you understand the actual thing too. I don't understand any of the coaching part. That's not true. And that and what we do. I mean like it's like I I like understand it but I don't know what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But like, and you also live and breathe it and do it and are physically XYZ and understand that stuff at an X level in our own in our own way. We're not we're not women with hormones, brother. We're not 40 years old and overweight. We're [ __ ] young and have testosterone and build muscle and just eat enough protein and then still are fine. So, this is a sneak peek into five minutes of every of six hours of every day. Um, thoughtful disagreement. I don't think we disagree. Yeah, we agree. I don't even think we disagree. We We agree there though. Yeah, I obviously lean more uh thinking about thing. Not thinking uh technical detail holdups, what could break, whatever. Luke thinks more vision big. Anything can work. People pay everyone over. I think oh we, you know, don't make as much margin because of this. Luke thinks everyone, you know, is true. Everyone makes great money that works with us and does that because of that. There's no one in the entire space that pays better than us. Yeah. Blended. No doubt that's an that's an ad for people to join us. It's not it's not wrong. It's not wrong. It's not wrong. It's not wrong. Which again hurts us at some level. Like we go in these rooms and these guys are making XYZ or doing this and it's like there is a portion of us. We had this conversation last night that's like you know we're we're almost like over complicating things or like doing a lot more to like make less than someone else. Like if you compare the amount of like actual like team size and like amount of meet and like all the stuff to make X number. It's like there's a lot of ways to get to a goal, but what we're trying to build is different than all of them as well and can go to a different layer than any of the other ones can go because of how we're building it. And it's fun because it's on hard mode. It's on hard mode and it's also stuff that translates like L said into any other thing we do. So it's like, oh, now we know how to do this thing. We're essentially getting paid to do it at some level, right? like to learn how to do it and like [ __ ] it up and then try it again and build a real company and build like a real Exactly. an off. There's, you know, everyone in the space like, "Oh, what offer are you running?" Or like, "Oh, what's this?" And it's like, "No, no, no, no." It's like, "We're not an offer." We're like, "That's classy." Uh, we're not. Yeah. So, it's like, but they make great money, but it's just not our goal. So, uh, that's all I got. Anything else specific? No. That was a great answer to the question. All right, guys. Uh, we are here. I don't know how many more days. Um, but yeah, that's that. So, six more I believe in. Catch on Twitter, on Instagram. loves shameless plugs. Uh yeah, I'll link them out on these. So, I will talk to you guys tomorrow. Hopefully this hopefully this one was helpful and if I missed your question in there, it's because it was too technical or too whatever. And I will go back to it and get it next week. So, thanks for watching. Bye, guys. Please.

# Recap of London Mastermind | EP93
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1AQpWco3rU

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be doing a quick event recap of the AFL Manor Mastermind, which is an event thrown by Iman. There's three days of good info, a lot of takeaways, some cool people. So, I'm going to give you a quick recap of that, and then we're going to do a Q&A live with Luke, co-founder, and Miruse, who's our media buyer. So, if there's some audio in the background, I'm sorry. All right. Not a normal video. We've done around 76 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. Not here to sell you anything. Everything on the channel is just showing what has worked for us and what has not worked for us. All with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities and building a cool network of people doing cool [ __ ] especially in info coaching. All right, so kick things off. Day one was all around seuite culture. Um, so his entire seuite is essentially like a big core piece of the offering. Um, so part of AFL. So you get access to them uh in a group setting. Um, there's calls with them, a lot of recorded content of them. But during the event, they shared a ton of stuff about how they operate, uh, marketing, sales, content, product, all those things. Uh, and they were really, really impressed on culture and team. They showed a bunch of good stuff. Yesterday's video, uh, I believe it was yesterday, um, I made one that was all about this and how some of the takeaways we had and how I see that playing out for us. Um, and then from there, they rolled into a detox thing, which is pretty cool. Um, a guy that's very, very extreme about this. Um, and has some crazy case studies and some crazy results. Um but yeah, it was overall it was all like overall very very good. Um and just kind of like a good intro day and then rolled into just some chill vibes. We all went out to dinner and had um you know some fun. So that was cool. Day two was much more into tactics, right? So event two was all about their launches. They're like known for their events that they do uh when inside of Educate and some of these other companies they have. Um so they went very very deep on how to do events. I'm not going to give away everything inside there. Like you can do that yourself, but that's not really I'm not here to sell anything or do anything. I don't I don't care. Um but yeah, did that and then everyone went and did sports. They were doing like clay pigeon shooting and stuff, but we had meetings, so I actually had to stay back, which was an interesting thing for me cuz I was like, "Wow, all these guys crush it and they don't have to be on meetings like this or for whatever reason, they weren't on meetings for any of these." So yeah, it was a interesting perspective shift that we're, you know, still crushing on these meetings and doing stuff and maybe we need to evolve in a certain way. So that was good. Um and then big fitness YouTuber, uh that was really really nice and cool. uh went up there and talked about his journey, his growth, kind of his lifestyle that he builds around this and doing that. And then we had a black tie event which is super fun. Each one of these nights we were up until like 4 in the morning, which is kind of crazy. It's like not my vibe or like normally what I would do, but a lot of cigars, a lot of good conversations, so I was here for it. And then day three, which is today, so it was just a few days. Uh we talked a lot of things around like M&A adviser was there. Um they were talking about a lot of like bigger moves, things to do, kind of like what you do. Iman kept saying what you do with your golden uh golden eggs that come from your golden goose. um like what do you do with those? What do you do with the cash flow that spits off? Instead of trying to think that you're ever going to sell your info coaching business, just take the cash flow, either put in investments, um go and buy put in companies, do whatever your kind of like niche specific thing is, which can be anything, right? Um so some people are super into art like he was saying, some people are super into businesses, some people are into these things. So it was around there and then Wap guys came up and talked a lot about payments and they have some crazy cool stuff that they're launching. So yeah, that's just kind of general overview. Again, I don't want to give away kind of any of the stuff that they were directly doing cuz that's not my place to do. Um, but some of the takeaways I had super interesting. The guys that were sitting next to us, um, that I had on, actually, Tan I had on here, has a very similar business model to us, but everybody else in the room almost ex like almost I'm pretty sure every single other person runs a very similar model to Iman. So, it's very organic heavy. They do launches a lot of the time. Some of them have evergreen, someone's kind of back and forth. A lot of them have direct to cart, so like info style. Some have sales calls, but then still direct to info versus coaching. Um, and if they do have coaching, it's group coaching or kind of like these really high leverage ones. Um, and some of them have retention. So, breaking these down, we're extremely paid heavy. We're evergreen, so it's kind like consistent or tries to be every day instead of these massive launches where you'll do, you know, 10 million bucks or 4 million bucks or two or whatever and then just like have LOLs. Um, direct toart, a lot of these guys are doing those then through direct toart because you're not going to have availability on sales calls and calendars that are x amount of days out. Um, and then a lot of them then will ramp with this and then have a really good retention. So, I thought that was very interesting because it's like clearly they absolutely crush it like crush it crush it because they do I mean like the Eman example, right? They'll do organic almost exclusively. They do paid now and he like leans into there a little bit and he talks about that in some of his videos. Um, they'll do these massive launches but they do still have evergreen stuff. The majority of stuff is direct to cart meaning it's going to be under whatever 2K. Um then once they're in there, they're in his ecosystem and like in that world that will have stuff on sales call kind of on the back end like AFL specific just cuz it's a higher ticket. And then they have great retention. They have great brand. They have all that kind of stuff for different products. So yeah, it was just very interesting to me to see like what pieces and parts we could do. Like some of the main things I took away from it was like organic, organic, organic. That was huge. They talked about some stuff around like revenue drivers and how they have like key events throughout the year and like make a big deal around them, which I thought was very cool cuz like it's basically like giving you permission to be able to do that in your business, whatever it is. to like have specific events or like I don't want to say promos because that's not necessarily it because it doesn't even have to be a special or like a sale. It can still just be like a big hyped up event and still be the normal price which is interesting. Same thing with on the back end. Um the direct toart stuff is very interesting cuz we still have never done anything mid ticket which is a brilliant I mean I love the idea of it. Uh if you guys go back and watch the Brooke hit video, he talks about some crazy numbers where they're selling a 1 to 2k product and then they have a 20 to 45% whatever like um uh take rate on the essentially ascension to a done with you or done for you offer on the onboarding call which is super cool. So we don't have anything built into that. We only have that for low ticket to high ticket. Um which is kind of like a vast jump. You know you're going from something that's under $100 to something that's over $5,000 which like just depending on the framing. But ours works pretty well. I was just aware of and whatever. I'll go into that another video. But and then hamster wheel versus retention. Um this was a big difference between the guys even sitting next to us that are running the same business model essentially as us with like paid very heavy evergreen consistent around there like around those kind of things. Um but they have insane retention like insane retention and it's a much higher ticket. So much higher like five times the price of ours. Um so I thought that was very interesting cuz they can do less volume. the retention is crazy because like they went through a lull like we did uh with new acquisition and when we go through a lull in new acquisition it's like sorry these guys are having too much fun. Um but when we go through a lull in acquisition it's it hurts everything because while we do have retention it's nowhere near like the rate or the dollar value that theirs is. So I thought that was very interesting um and definitely something we need to optimize around. So I just really next one on here is like the love info coaching space. Like I'm such a fan of it. I think it's so cool. I mean, it's not like I don't want to say it's like not it just has so many unique cool characteristics and Iman talked about this a bit, but like I don't know. I just like really respect the way that he's built into the space. Um, and you know, people [ __ ] on him or not. I don't really care. Like I I think it's I think what he does is just crazy. I think he crushes it. Um, but they really are more so cash flow businesses. So, we talk about like, you know, hitting exit velocity and getting to a point where we have actual equity value and we can actually sell something uh or sell this with supplements included or, you know, backend recurring and main recurring and multiple acquisitions or and like all these different things you'd have to do to essentially like it would still cash flow like heavy during that process, but like you're building it in a way that you're almost like eating away at the cash flow and eating away at the time and resources in order to get to this like potential thing. Uh, which is just a different way than these guys play. Like these guys are like dead set, very clear, like this is a cash flow business. We're going to run these things at 80% margin and we are just going to hammer it while we can. Take all the money out of there. They all live in places that are like very, you know, low tax or no tax zones. We're going to take all that money and we're going to buy into this company or this software. We're going to build this other side thing or we're going to have ecom business that has uh equity value. Um yeah, so it's just like a it's just like a different game. It's just a different game. What you going to bring us in? I'm going to bring you in in 12 seconds. And then uh people people uh best part about the entire thing was the people in the room. So by far this was a very very low um low amount of content necessarily. So there's like a much much lower I don't you go to some conferences that are literally just endless amounts of content just presentation presentation presentation and we like hate those. So while you can get gold golden nuggets out of those it's just like really boring kind of. Um so this was very much so like Q&A focused. So, it was like x amount of presentation, then a lot of Q&A or like uh fireside chats with a mic in the audience. Um, and then just hang out with people like the entire time. So, it was lunches and breakfast, I'm sorry, breakfast, lunch, um, dinners where everyone was kind of moved around. So they had to like kind of meet and it was small enough that you could like meet everyone but not big enough that you'd like that you wait small enough that you wouldn't run into like the same person or like you know be forced to only be with like 12 people but it was not large too large to where you didn't get to meet anybody you didn't want to meet. So I found that really cool and there were some very high level people there like very very high level people that were just like super approachable and just like want to talk to everyone. It was cool. So I thought that was very cool. Um, I did create some questions for these guys and uh, you guys have kind of asked for this a little bit in the past. So, we're going to see what we got here. But, uh, Mary does a bunch of media buying for info coaching and I believe Mary, you do ecom, too, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, he does info and ecom, but, uh, he does some whales and info and then Luke co-founder talk about business partner in the biz. So, I'm going to take you out there and we're going to see how this looks and if it sucks, I'm going to [ __ ] turn it off. So, that's that, boys. The time is now. See how this looks. See how this looks. Can we turn around? Yeah, you should turn around on your beautiful balcony. All right. Can we see? Can we see? Look at that. We can see. All right. I'm going to hit you with questions. I'm going to sit over here. That was beautiful. Perfect. Yeah. Um All right. 10 minutes in. We're going to go for a little bit from the get. What did you spend till I always talk about this on here? When were you were still spending? We didn't even have media buyers until what? 20 a day. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. 15. Yeah. So Luke was the one who was literally doing all the media buying, all the copy, most of the copy, creative review, all of that stuff up until we at like 20. We tried agencies. If you go back, I talk about this more, but we talked we we ran with agencies and then in the end we ended up landing with Marus. I always say his name wrong, but he's a goat and he works with a bunch of different info people, which is interesting because we don't have a lot of contractors that are like agency. And you wouldn't consider yourself an agency though, would you? I don't I hate saying I'm an agency, but we're kind of Yeah. slowly becoming one. So, where we're going with things and like the growth of it, like we need a lot of dedicated people and like we have exceptions and we made an exception for this guy over here forward. Um, yeah. So in if you guys go back to other videos, I have org charts where we talk about the structure and like who else exists within the marketing team. Um but these guys full run all of meta. So we're just going to go through some random meta questions. So current no what's a better one. How do we run optimizations because everyone asks this all the time and how do you handle campaign structure? Well, okay. Um, our rock specifically is dividing. If I have to do two big categories, it would be scheduled campaigns that optimize us to get qualified book calls in and purchase campaigns, which in our case, our sales cycle is pretty long. So, purchase campaigns takes a very long time until it fires on the pixel, but at the same time, it brings us the best quality and also acts as a pretty much your marketing campaign on steroids. So two main two categories it's purchase and schedule campaigns from there we have a [ __ ] ton of other campaigns like if you look if someone looks at our account it will probably say it's unorganized but that's because we also have a lot of other funnels now when you're running do you run I mean I know you run other info funnels but so if you run other call funnels is that how you normally have them set up or are they set up differently for us meaning is the schedule and purchase thing normal to like throttle between the two. That is normal. We we run them both across VSLs and webinars too. Interesting. Okay. Webinars are actually even more efficient way of purchase campaigns. And is that because it's direct to cart so it feeds back quicker? Yeah. So like you know let's say you run 5 days prior to the webinar like you know every single Wednesday or every single Thursday I'll get 100 fires on the pixel from that webinar. Interesting. Okay. Um, how do you handle creative testing and different when they're I guess how do you handle creative testing when you have similar angles? So like small changes and then when you have massive like completely different changes in terms of angles and messaging depends on on budget too. Um, if you're working with an account that can't handle budget like yours, usually we we do give creative testing the structure is let's say one we have the creative testing campaign, one asset, the asset dedicated specific to that specific creative. No matter if we have a couple of other creatives that are very similar, maybe the hook is different. We'll give let's say x amount of budget. Let's say 300 bucks. And in there will not have only one but usually it's either two or three creatives and like the same creative but just have different copy iterations because usually you'll see that this specific creative with copy two will work better than the other two variations like you choose a winner that one. Sorry about all the audio. This is probably terrible but I kind of don't care. All right, Kish, you wrote the copy for the ads that did like 80% of the revenue of the entire thing and they lived through and it almost burned us in the best way possible because weinging hammered it and we needed more diversification and we didn't. How what is your copy journey? My copy journey? Yeah. Uh I was up in it when I read it. Uh, so you know that was a long time ago, but I was just writing a bunch of [ __ ] copy when I wrote those ads. So I just was deep into books and writing sales pages and trying lots of different copy. So yeah, that's everyone asked me how we like learn [ __ ] and I always talk about how I find people who have what we want. We model it and we buy courses and we [ __ ] speedrun and do that. But at that time, do you remember the courses we were in? Remember that like the courses, the lives? I was an absolute psychopath during that time. Yeah. So I I didn't let myself do anything other than like there was a period of time where I literally didn't let myself consume anything other than books and videos on marketing and how to [ __ ] like literally at the end of the night I'd be like I just want to like watch TV and I would just make myself watch like [ __ ] funnel videos and marketing videos. So, and how did that change? Because we went from, most people on here know, but we went from low ticket, the app game, and we were dumb, didn't understand ascension and all that at the time, and then we went to kind of infodirect, but then mainly it was just the salesunnel, the sales call funnel. So, like what shifted in how cuz you ran all the accounts up until we were doing like over a million a month. Mhm. So, like what did you frame change or have to learn to like how did the account change when doing that? It was just literally [ __ ] spending more. Yeah. You're just hammering it more. Yeah. Yeah. We used to budget. We used to go in and we have like all these automated trackers now and for two and a half or 3 years of it, we would manually fill it out every single day. So, we know exactly what was in there and look at the metrics every day manually because we didn't trust that ourselves too if it just ran automatically. Um, all right. What do you feel like in current state in current state is wasting time or where we're like overlapping like where is there like fluff and what we're currently doing in marketing? That's both of you. I don't think we're wasting too much time. I don't know if it's time. I don't know if it's our creative or you know I say like you know the Blake Blake who's the CMO is like putting together a new team and I think there's like time before that all goes as fast as it can and I think there's like organization stuff that wastes time where things don't go probably like as fast as they could but I think with some time that will change because it's just a new team. I I have a take on this, please. Like on on wasting time. Not not sure if it's wasting time, but a thought that I every single time I look at that low ticket ad account that we run, my thought is like, why the [ __ ] is this one not running international? Cuz we could be making so much more money. Well, usually it's cuz the people that would then ascend would be international and then we wouldn't be able to service them with the coaching because of the time zones and the net CPA isn't good right now. But like he's saying it'd be lower cost, right? But like it's much much so we'd be able to get purchases but we wouldn't the issue is they wouldn't ascend at 5%. Even if they did we wouldn't be able to service them right as well. So if you would have something as we were talking with Luke in the sauna today you would have fulfillment team that's not necessarily only US based you could have a whole division like the low ticket finals most of the low ticket finals we run on international so outside of US the moment you get even in Canada UK Australia Europe the lier becomes profitable on the front end yeah I was talking to the XYZ guy I can tell you after but I was talking to them they did like three million a month but they're out of one of those main countries and they're calls are like so much different than ours. When he was saying stuff, I was like, "That's that's very interesting." Um, getting outside of the US. Yeah. Okay. So, what time is Oh man, we got to leave for dinner like any minute now. Um, if how do I say this correctly? Uh, of the other ones you see. So, I just talked about this on here about organic versus paid and how much different it is and how these guys are running it. Like we had a guy that was at the thing that uh at the event that is has 90% 92% show rates and 55% close rates because it's all organic and he was like, "Oh, I want to run ads." I'm like, "Dude, your shit's going to get cut in half and you're going to need double the team and it's going to be whatever." So, how do you see in the other companies and how do you see it in ours organic as a piece of this function? Do you work with a bunch of people that have a ton of organic and then some paid or is it usually like a mix? And then what do you think about our organic current setup or where we're going to go with it? I hope you guys can hear me because I'm talking that way. So sorry. Most of the clients we work with do have organic. I I would say in terms of companies that do seven figure plus a month constantly. Both of them probably have I would say 20% of their monthly revenue that comes from organic and which I don't think in our case is the case. No, it's not even close. Yeah, I always say I'm like our first click is like 2% organic. Um, like in their cases also think of they do come probably because we're spending so much on all of those funnels, they do come from ads, they start following and it like it becomes like a very long sales cycle where like they consume so much content and then they opt in in the funnel and it's like organic. Yeah. Like there's no way to prove it came from an ad. But super important especially the YouTube side of things. Yeah. I will not say the name of the company, but you know the guy very well and it's not like he runs a YouTube channel and it's not even his main like it's not even the company YouTube channel like he just has the link in bio and he's producing a couple six figures a month just from those YouTube videos. Yeah. And on their paid they're profitable on their front end and their calls they literally do a negative number on what their call costs them because they're actually making money to book calls. Um, all right. And then, yeah, so I always talk about on here, organic for us exists as middle and bottom of funnel. It's also one of the reasons the VSSL opt-in funnel works for us is because once we have their email, we hit them with so much content that then they go back to the site and it exists as a flywheel, which is actually Luke's initial idea um to make like a website that was filled with the resources that had a flywheel or whatever you call a web of content where they just exist within it and can continue. Um, so where do you see I've kind of talked about it. Where do you see us going with organic for first click? Like true organic generation versus middle and bottom. Um, like do you think it's going to be important for us in the future? Do you not care about it? We're just going to hammer it with paid. Yeah, I don't care. I don't care. Um, I I look at it more like it's just views and if you have something with good organic, there's a lot of advantages to it and then it can be really profitable. And then, you know, eventually, usually if you want to scale bigger for whatever reason, you leave that audience and then you have to go into cold traffic. Um, and then you're doing paid. So, I think I think it I don't think of them as like different things. It's just what's your business model and then what are your goals? And if you know you want to be super profitable and not spend money on ads and you have good organic, then just keep doing that. And then if you want to do ads, do ads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like I don't know. I know so many of these guys now in this organic world and I look at their P&Ls and their stuff like a lot of the time they're not doing as big of numbers or if they do sorry fast cars. Um but a lot of the time these guys don't do as large of numbers but they do insane percent right like 80 90% margins cuz they don't take 30%. I will say the good part about like if you're trying to scale a team I like paid. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz it's consistent. Yeah. Because like once you get it working, it's kind of like a machine. Like you can put if you know you can put one in and get three out. Yeah. And you can hire people more comfortably I feel like than like having to like rely on a video and and that's just my experience though. You can be so good at organic that you feel like you have more control with organic. So yeah, it's like a double-edged sword cuz like you have like I talked about on here like evergreen and consistency is one thing and then the other side of it though is the cost of it and then if it breaks and you have a straight line, you're [ __ ] potentially because like you're just relying on this one thing, cash going out the door, build up a big team and then it stops and you don't have this organic base you can like try and push through or do something with and then it's retention. It's this and that. So we actually got to pop out of here. Um, and then the last thing on organic is I have talked about on here. We just hired a company to do organic and all these things and it's hilarious. We got to have a conversation one time on here about like how we make decisions and like our overlap and what because it's pretty [ __ ] funny. So, all right guys, you rock. Thank you. We'll make this better and longer and probably over something, you know, on an actual like Riverside or something. But peace, guys. Day 93 in the books.

# $75M culture hacks (our EXACT setup) | EP92
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cn8FpIrj5c

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be talking about culture and team building in the info coaching space. There are a lot of differences between info coaching and other online business models and other business models in general. So, we're going to specifically break down our core values, departments, meeting cadence, communication cadence, how they differ in info coaching versus other online business models, and then kind of talk through some new concepts we're coming up with around these that we're going to roll out based on an event we're at. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 76 million actually in total cash collected and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. Old goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people building cool All right. Again, sorry I'm on the road. I'm in London and we're at Eman's event. I don't know if you can see this, but 8 figure manor mastermind got some big day. So, we are learning new things and just getting a lot of perspective, right? So, uh, we have an info coaching business that's a little bit different than a lot of others. Uh, ours is not this big massive margin cash flow biz. Uh, ours is a little bit more focused on mass scale now and how we've built it. And that's solely because of how we built it. So, we're going to walk through some of these today. Um, and I think you're going to get a gist. So, for us, again, we're always a work in progress. We learn something and we adapt. We learn something new. We adapt another direction. Sometimes things, you know, but heads, sometimes they don't. Um, so where we're at currently with our core values is future focused. We truly truly live this uh in our main business. Um definitely live this like everything that we're doing is for 3 months from now, a year from now. Foundationally built now. For a long time there's a lot of duct tape. It was a right now cash thing. It was a right now decision thing. And now it's much more future focused which we love. World class. Think of that like a players. Think of that like just doing the best by the customer. Think of that in all ways. It's just world class. We have the best tech. We have the best people. We have the best systems. We have the best conversations. We have the best results for the clients. We have the best. We have the best world class. Okay. Radical transparency. This is a little bit on client side, but mainly meant on like an internal team side. And this is around for us just like truth. Truth from personal to professional. Truth from how you show up here to how you show up there. Truth for all those things. Um this has been this one's been with us for a while. Um but it really kind of like sticks through and true. And we've had definite moments. I've had definite moments of this like 100% where had to just come through and be radically transparent on fuckups I've made or situations or things. Same with across the company is really important to us. And then extreme ownership kind of stacks on that one at least in my head. Um to where you know everything is extreme, you know, extremely owned ownership like it truly is on you to do things and take responsibility and own it. Uh and I do view those two as kind of like not one and the same but they stack on each other. So I like these core values for us. Um yesterday was a big conversation around basically team and culture building. Um and what Eman's built is like really fantastic what they have in their team and the culture they have. So for us the departments are broken out like this in current state. So marketing, sales, CS, product, tech, finance and people. These ones are kind of the two funky ones because finance is essentially me and we need to hire in for that sooner than later. Um people is the same as product right now for the lead and then CS sits within those. So it's really kind of like these three in one. Tech and finance are in one because of me and then sales and marketing are standalone. Um because we're very very acquisition focused right now or like heavy. So we're very direct response style. Um meeting cadence wise around this and kind of to back up on here though real quick. So departments so they were sharing a bunch of different examples of how they have their company set up. I was talking to people next to me that were doing 30 million a year in info um that were way leaner than us which is interesting. Um I was talking to you know Iman and their team and how structured they are and all these guys have great margins and it's like we don't um in that way until we're at a certain scale because of how we built it and how we're trying to build it. So just kind of like an interesting point of view to see how they have their structured um where certain things are like there's um you know guerilla style team on there that can do multiaceted pieces of the work. Another big part of this is um kind of bouncing all over the place but welcome. I'm traveling. So, um, is the global talent pool that all these guys use. We focus like almost exclusively on W2, uh, inside the US and it's a huge cost and it's also a different style of work ethic. Not to say you can't find them, but it's just like a different average uh, style. Um, so yeah, it's just been interesting to see like where we're positioning this thing is going to continue to stay in that lane. Um, but a lot of these guys will have some like worldwide arbitrage on talent that's not something that we currently uh take advant uh, use or take advantage of. So with the meeting cadence around those departments, we have a marketing weekly. We have a sales daily which is also a sales for closers and then a sales for huddle uh I'm sorry for uh setters as well. CS kind of talks daily already. Product talks once a week and then again all these all talking communication channels and then everywhere all the time but like actual meetings that occur. Um tech happens weekly kind of uh tech is only that happens right here in this operations department and then there's an operations cross and then for the department ones it's every single one. So it's like think of it like this on a calendar. It's like, call it, let's just use examples, 9 or 10:00 a.m. to noon. Uh, so that 2-hour block on Tuesday and Thursday. This block right here is going to be for uh cross department ops. And then this one is going to be for dedicated. So like in 30-minute blocks for four departments. So we're going to go product, then we're going to go marketing, no, we're going to go tech, then we're going to go um product, then we're going to go marketing, then we're going to go sales. So that's like how we currently operate it on like an operational level. Um but for the um for the divisions themselves, they only operate on these. So one of the interesting things that we learned while we were at the event um was that a lot of these guys will do daily huddles, which is super interesting to us. Like entire department daily. So they'll have uh you know 40 50 people on one meeting for about 30 minutes and they'll go through updates just like water cooler talk and just like have fun and do that and then on the other side of it they'll go um and go from there into breakout rooms beyond those. So they will have their main meeting that's like the operations section uh or like the companywide section and then they'll go breakout room so it's just sales and they'll go breakout room so it's just marketing breakout room so it's just this um which I find very interesting. I don't know our team's like very large so I'm not sure 100% if that's something we're going to like take action on for ourselves and do. Um but definitely with the daily portion I think we are going to roll out for the actual department. So sales already does it. I think marketing should do it on daily. I think CS should do it on daily. I think product should do it on daily and tech should do it on daily and just a touch point and just like so people aren't living on an island and just like existing outside of there. Um so keep these and then bring these to daily. So we basically just have like one operational management style version on top and then the actual the example they used was essentially like seale managers and then makers. So like the people boots on the ground. So an simple example of sales but you have like sales rep you have like sales manager and then you have like sea level meeting. So that sales manager would have the sea level meeting and then they would have a daily touch point with all of their team. And I think that that would be really good for us. Um because everyone kind of does live on an island. We haveund whatever people now at this point. Um it's high. It's like 100 I don't I say that because we have W2 and uh contractor and I never know if I should include both of them but you know call it 130 right so yeah team is growing and I think this would be very helpful and continue to keep the culture tight and then communication cadence for us right now exists basically just as I have other videos where I go like deep into this and meeting structure and across this and agendas and you know slack channel breakdowns but right now for us we just talk on Slack and then we talk on Zoom right we have Zoom meetings that are these cadence um and then a bunch of ad hoc stuff and and all the Slack channels in the world. So, we only meet like once or twice a year in person and thus far it's only been basically like Seale or like, you know, owners and operators kind of style. Um, and it might be interesting for us. We were talking to somebody about the math on how to budget this, but it's like, you know, it can easily be a quart million dollars for a trip like this, which is like that's a lot of money that like eats into into margin. Um, but it's so important because like the team is everything. So, we're just trying to navigate how we would be able to do something that could be impactful. One of the things they did, um, actually here, let me roll in this new concept piece. Um, but so yeah, so their new concept that they were talking about that I think we're going to roll is daily huddles on each department. More fun, less people on an island sitting their own thing. Collapse the timelines is an interesting idea, too, is when people are working on projects, like they'll have touch points or like we'll imagine you have a Tuesday and Thursday meeting. Tuesday you decide some stuff that needs to be done by Thursday and then kind of nothing really happens up until that Thursday meeting and then Thursday the next meeting is on Tuesday. So they have all the rest of Thursday, Friday, Monday and then up until Tuesday at the meeting to basically get that one thing done. And of course you can have projects that are that big or need to go further. But like a lot of the time it just kind of like expands the timeline when it doesn't need to be. And it happens because people then exist in their own world out here and it's like oh it's due on Tuesday. But if you're then meeting tomorrow and every day and having the FaceTime, like it's just so easy to hide behind the computer, me included. If it's like if I have someone uh that I'm talking to on Thursday for it due on Tuesday, I'm like, "Oh, cool. I'll do it by Tuesday." And it's like I I think this will be very helpful for our project charter and boards. Um I think that'll be good. And just a deeper stronger culture. Um this less segmented thing we have to solve for somehow because right now it kind of exists like acquisition and like fulfillment kind of are like the pockets. So you have like acquisition um that in current state has like male leadership which is no problem at all and then you know it's we're 97% uh female team um but it's like acquisition side so like marketing sales that exist over here all the sales reps are 90 something% of them are um female and current state and then on the uh fulfillment side it's female leadership and female over here and it's just like we need more blend both of like the roles and like you know again I'm not I don't really care or notice whatever directly on like gender or like whatever you want to call it, masculine or feminine, like everyone blends well together. It's just they don't have enough touch points. Um so it's like we're almost like not fostering the connection um that I think we can have. So trying to come up with a good way in the end. I mean like marketing is going to work with marketing, sales is going to work with sales, CS is going to work with CS, and product's going to work with product, right? Like they are um but I think there could be better touch points. So coming up with something for that cuz right now it's basically just existing within Slack and then on once a month um a all hands meeting with the company. So I think we can do something better that can have more touch points and would be cool and like a deeper stronger culture growth. Um cuz that's definitely something I'm just noticing here is like they were talking so much about culture and you know I'm sure you guys are all waiting for the secret sauce and like the nitty-gritty and the tactics and it's like those come and go those change but if you have the team that can implement them and be on them and like catch the waves and you know just work sidebyside you when it's good and bad the rest just kind of happens. And I was like, that's a very interesting perspective because it's true and it's like I have a great relationship with a lot of people in the in uh the business. But yeah, it's just just an interesting interesting perspective. So um and then yeah, an all company offsite. So figuring out how to budget and build this in and make it like actually feasible where you know because you're spending x amount of dollars and you're also you know we run 247 essentially. So having a model where we can essentially shut down for however many days, no calls coming in, marketing off, like it's a bigger idea than it's a bigger thing than just like oh we have to pay x amount of dollars to like fly everyone and get hotels and like throw on a thing. It's like the whole business shuts down. So you know I would assume so there's like all the opportunity missed cost. There's the ramping up and down of ads and then there's the hard costs of 150 people or 200 people at this time and flights and hotels and events and planning and all that stuff. So, just a cool idea though. Um I know these guys do it for like for example they did a a marathon all together. Um they did they're doing like some climb together. They're doing like all this cool stuff that they do to bring everyone together and they do it around a goal which I really like and that's our culture too is like competitive physical fitness um strong like just it's it's on brand for us. Um so it' be really cool if we could build something like that out. So yeah, that's kind of the general gist of like where we're at with this and thinking about things on like how we can collapse some of these departments into like proper leadership. having a lot of conversations about where I sit on things um and as these people start to take over more things and more so I let go of things which is another big thing is like me and my whole I want to work 16 hours a day all day every day um over time I mean I'm already not effective at that like I should probably be able to do what I do in eight hours I just bounce around between this and this and check this and that and like I want to be able to make sure that we have department heads that are happy and that love their role and that are compensated well for it and you know can handle it and we can be gone for two weeks weeks and then come back and like everything's better than it was when we left. Like we need that. We need to foster into that and get to that point and I think we're definitely in the right direction. Um but it'll just be interesting to see where I land on if I just go work on other things that are still like in parallel like I was talking about in a video two or three days ago where I just kind of move upstream and continue to learn like around the actual scope and sphere of this industry or if it's just kind of just be patient and focus on like literal personal and like self and other hobbies and stuff. so that it's not distraction from work. Like it'll be interesting to see how it navigates. Um because this is like golden goose number one and this is the most important thing to me when it comes to work and what I do on a daily basis. So yeah, it'll be interesting. But that's that guys. Um so where we're at right now is we're currently I want to give you some exact numbers. So I'm grabbing my phone here. Um but we are trending. Last month we finished out at 3 million. Um which was good for us but not great. Um but good for us in the sense that you know before that we were at 1.5 and we're kind of stuck in that little pocket. So uh currently right now we're trending for a little over three and we just changed all of our bookings um over from 30 minute slots to 45 minute slots. So there' be less volume but the idea being less miss calls because they're back to back to back more time for admin work in between deeper calls that can get higher close rate. Right? So like we have to offset that with the volume to the uh close rate. So I'm very interested to see where that goes. is we're going to run a minimum of a twoe test but in current state that puts us at you know low to mid3s which would be good for us you know ticking up in that direction um and then July is usually when we do our special so our special is internal only uh we only do it for renewals at this point um for the July one so you know essentially assume you have a 10k product that's recurring at 10k instead you offer it for 8k and you do it for one week that's essentially what we do so we're like just blast test it out to everyone and then we'll do we usually do like a couple million bucks on that. Um but we're going to test something that's actually higher so it's like less of a discount because we're trying to protect cash flow um or protect margin and push cash flow at the same time. So we're going to kind of like game that a little bit and see. So yeah, that's kind of where we're at. Um slower off the start uh of this month. Um we're technically trending up, but we slowed down from where we finished out last month. So yeah, blah blah blah. I'll just say but uh I have to run to this event. It's actually really good and uh I'm excited to give you guys some updates of what we've learned here so far after day two and three. Um and I'll be flying back in a couple days so I can kind of do like a full recap maybe then. Maybe that would be helpful. But all the videos are here. Um I got to schedule out some more interviews. If you guys check on the channel, I've done a bunch of interviews. Today's day 91 or two in a row of doing these. Um and yeah, I'm just in between sessions right now. Then back to another session, black tie event, all the things. So I appreciate you guys. Check out all the other videos here and I will talk to you soon. Hit me on IG or X.

Well, Jent, um, I'll introduce Ryan from from what I know. Actually, it's quite a funny connection because Ryan is a the co-founder owner of the company that my mother started closing for two years ago, which is interesting. Um, previously a guy that I'd worked with on Iman's team, his girlfriend was also closing and she was like asking Jack, did he know of any of the guys on Iman's team have any sisters or, you know, girlfriends? And I was like, my mother actually is a good closer. And then my mother started working with them. And then I actually seen Ryan's stuff before I knew Ryan was involved with Warrior Babe. And then I was like, he's really good. Went to his Twitter and I seen Warrior Babe and I was like, oh that's sick. Um, so yeah, obviously them boys have done phenomenal numbers over the last multiple years. Anything in the info space in regarding to marketing, front end, back end. He's here to answer it all to be as transparent as possible, he said to me as well. Um, but yeah, overall great guy and he's doing some great work on the YouTube game right now as well. So go check him out on YouTube if you haven't already. Um, but yeah, Ryan, if there's anything I missed, maybe even a brief introduction, then we can hop straight into the the details that you've you've set up for us. Yeah, 100%. So, you guys have never done this before. So, transparent messages, Q&A, all the things probably going to how we're going to navigate this. Um, but yeah, started on X and YouTube about 85 90 days ago. Recorded every single day since. And the whole big push there was for us to find talent opportunities and network with people, right? We just kind of like lived in the cave and weren't very vocal about what we did. didn't have any friends in the space, didn't have any of that. Um, just through vendors. So, the quick of us is roughly six years ago. Uh, we started and essentially where Luke and Nikki met. So, they're the co-founders and I'm a co-owner. So, big difference there. They started this and then I came on as number four or five essentially uh and was building sales pages for them and doing like random ClickFunnels builds for a thousand bucks every like six to eight weeks. like it was a very light uh start and they were trying to sell a low ticket info product at the time that was a recurring uh a recurring product and then we kind of quickly six months a year in launched over into a call funnel and that's still the call funnel we run to today. So we've been running this funnel now for 5 years we've done 75 and 76 in total cash collected 76 million um and this funnel one specific did 71 million of that. So I'm going to walk you guys through some of the funnels. We're going to go through some math and then I literally just want to open this to Q&A. Understand? I heard sales, sales management, agency, like different kind of mix in the room. So, I just want to make this as customized as possible uh for you guys, but I'll walk through some of the uh the funnels to start and some of the math. So, let me know if you guys can see this. Yeah, good. All right. So, if you guys have seen in the YouTube, I apologize for the five minutes of what you've probably already heard. Um, but this was initially the YouTube is daily what is happening now. So it's if we're thinking and we're all in marketing, it's all me all talking about marketing. If we're in sales and trying to fix sales, we're talking about sales. So I talked a lot about this marketing piece in the beginning, but essentially this is what we call our VVS is what our CMO titled this, but it's our value vortex system. So we have three different funnels now actively running. This initial funnel right here is your classic VSSL opt-in funnel. And this is the one that we did 72 71 72 million in before we even launched these. So, these are going to be very, very classic. You're going to send someone to an opt-in page. It's going to be for a free training. They're going to watch. They're going to put in their name and email to access the VSSL. We have two different ones and splits going on now, but just to keep this simple, an opt-in page, a VSSL page that's going to wait until the call to action in the VSSL. That's call it 80% of the way through the video. And it's going to have an apply button pop. They're going to apply. They're going to book a call. They're going to have a thank you page. They're going to talk to a closer. And they're going to close. Okay? that is like the simplest throughput like humanly possible. And this one right here, we've done hundreds of thousands of calls through. So, this is like uh we're very very heavy in paid advertising. About 99% of our first click, 98% of our uh first click is through paid, not through organic, which is a lot different than I'm sure probably a lot of you guys, as well as like the Eman crowd and stuff like that. Super respect for what you guys do with organic. Uh it's just not a a channel that we ever leaned heavily into in terms of optimizing for you know virality or first click. It's always been for us content has been around middle of funnel and bottom of funnel. The next funnel we launched was actually this low ticket ascension. So look at it just as these. So you're going to have a sales page. I don't know if you guys are familiar with Alen Sultanic and what he does in the Nothing Held Back group on Facebook and he's got a bunch of good content. Um but this is essentially the the method he was teaching. Um so you're going to have a front-end sales page that's going to be long form. They're going to start the checkout process with their name and email and then move to an order form. So on this you're going to target call it 15% of the people that land on this page from cold, warm, whatever traffic are going to uh opt in on here. Go to a checkout page around 50% of the people are going to then purchase. And then the big difference here and what we're doing on low ticket versus what you'll see a lot on the internet is ours is focused on ascension. It is not focused on AOV. So, we are not trying to do upsell one, two, three, four, downell left, right, like any of that stuff. We are doing a post-purchase that just says, "Hey, you just purchased your product. Now, book your onboarding call, book your quick start call, your implement, whatever you want to call it." And we get them on the phone with a setter. The setter then gets them on the phone with a closer and then they close. Okay? So, this throughput right here has the highest show rate and close rate of anything in our entire company. So, all you're doing on this game is you're playing economics. So, if it costs you $150 to acquire a customer, that is $50 purchase. Your net CPA is 100 bucks. And I can go through some of this math over here for you guys if you want or we can just open straight to Q&A. Um, but essentially the net number that it costs to get somebody on here to here and to here backs out to less than if they're going through here because you are accepting cash, right? Because there's the offset of selling something low ticket. You also have the framing complete difference because you're talking to a buyer, not a lead. And then you also have the setter two call close instead of the one call close that occurs up here. All right, so that's the general gist and then I'll touch on this one briefly and then we can go into math or questions or whatever. Um, but DTA, this is super common in the space. You'll see this all over. We call it DTA. Some people call it uh direct to VSSL, direct to app, whatever you want to call it. And this is essentially your headline, your VSSL, and your apply button. Okay, so way less friction. They don't have to go through this step, wait until the thing pops, get to here, do this. they essentially are jumping directly to the application right here. So, you're going to have way more throughput, way lower cost per call. Um, but you are generally speaking not going to have the same quality consumption show rates. So, your show rates are going to drop, your close rates are going to drop depending on how you frame these pages. So, we almost use this as a retargeting asset, but a lot of guys, like if you listen to uh Jeremy Haynes, they talk a lot about this funnel. This is like the main one that they run for all their products that get to a million a month. um they'll run this to uh an app and booking kind of in one actually and then book it and then they do all the stuff that's in between these and I could talk for literally five hours about different automations and flows and tracking and metrics and math and all that but like I don't really want to bore you guys or go in a direction that's not where you live um and what is relevant for you. So up here is just the connection of how all three of these funnels play into one. Okay, so this is essentially how they work. They all flow in one. A lot of the core traffic is going to come through the opt-in funnel. It's going to hit a router. We technically have a routing that occurs inside of our application that'll make them qualified or disqualified. We still take the bookings even if they're disqualified, but we route them to a lower quality pod of sales reps or training sales reps. So top leads go to top bookings or top uh agents. And if calendars are full, it'll push them over here into this low ticket. And then the DTA and the low ticket are both getting their own direct traffic. But the master that gets a majority will then route into these other funnels. Okay. So I can go through metrics, I can go through stats, I can go through math, I can go through organization chart, I can do whatever you guys want. Um, so yeah, maybe we open it up a little bit to question on what. Um, so I see one already in the chat. James, you tell me how you want me to navigate and we can go from there. Yeah, we can do chat until there's none in chat. Boys, I say you can go by chat or you can raise hand, whatever you prefer. Okay. Yeah. I mean, let's start with this one in chat and then if you guys want to do audio, I'm open to either. So, first one we have in here is Tom saying, "What internal upsells do you have? And if so, how do you structure upselling current clients into the program and what's the tech behind the router?" Okay, so first one for the internal upsells. So, for us, the main offering, let me see if I can do this. I've never built one of these live. Um, but so for us, the main offering is going to be VIP. This is an annual program. This is our onetoone coaching. Okay? So, no matter where you come in on this funnel, you can technically buy this low ticket product. That's the only thing you can direct to cart purchase and that's going to be a um $37 product. There's one order bump on there because order bumps don't hurt conversion rates or um affect the flow because our whole thing on this is throughput. But so for internal upsells, the only thing that's going to happen is after their first year of VIP, they're going to be offered VIP again. So it's a continuation program. So it's onetoone personalization for the entire year. So, we have people that are two, three, four years into being a VIP member and they'll pay we do two internal uh upsell cycles or internal promotion upsell cycles uh that happen in July and Black Friday, Cyber Monday, so six months apart where we'll do a discounted rate of VIP. So, we'll drop it a,000 bucks, call it 5K, 6K, and it's only for internal renewals and we'll do 2 million bucks in a week and just hammer it to the current list. You just need to make sure you know your costs on fulfillment so it makes sense. Um, but we only do that twice. And then what we just now launched, we probably left 20 million bucks on the table. Um, so far on how because we've had a leaky bucket and because we haven't retained these in the correct way. We've been stuck on this hamster wheel of getting new clients. You hear hormone, you hear a lot of these people talk about this, your LTV to CAC and all of that. It's because we've had a leaky bucket where people will churn out of this and that's for a million reasons. Because of how the fulfillment structured, because of the payment plan types we put them on. We tried to use a firm external financing and we didn't realize it was set up wrong and people could do 24 months of payments for a 12-month term. So someone's still paying into the second year which is like legal and okay but just like not good for retention and long term. So what we just rolled out is actually a thing called 360 and this is going to be group coaching. So our fulfillment model changes from onetoone to group. So you have a coach that has multiple right and doesn't do any of the onetoone communication all this stuff. your so your fulfillment cost goes down from call it 15 or 20% to 5% or less 2%. This is more of the Eman or like what a lot of these guys will do the classic group coaching model. Um so their fulfillment stack it's way less and then this is like half price. So this will be 7200 this is 3600 and this is for the year. So they basically just join they stay for community they stay for access to the app they stay for all the things they want to stay for but don't have to pay the full price for the second year just they basically pull back on that. So internal upsells, these are the only ones that would exist is year two because everything in year one is sold as uh one year. Um we do have different payment plans, but everyone is locked into a year-long contract. And then the tech behind the routing is in current state uh is Jot Form. So we just got on it early. I'm not a super fan of Jot Form. I like custom. I like you see a ton of people use type form. Like both work. Um, but essentially the router inside here is going we have one financial qualifier question that for us because we're not doing MMO or like ROI justification stuff. It's how much have you invested in yourself in the past. So it's basically saying have you invested uh less than 1K, 1 to 5K, 5 to 10, 10 to 20 or 20 plus. The less than 1Ks are what route to the DQ and they have a half the they have half the conversion rate that the that the next ones do. So all the other ones are 10, 11, 12% roughly and the less than 1K are 5%. And that's also causation and correlation because they're going to uh lower quality reps. So it's like you kind of play that game, but you have to think of it as the most positive side. And the most positive side is if you have the top possible lead coming through, do you want that lead landing with your newest rep? And the answer is no. You never want that. You never want someone who is the most qualified person in the world landing with one of these people. So you have to segment those out. But how we talk about it is essentially like imagine you have 10 bookings that come through and only two are premier and like top clients. You want those two to go there first. The other eight then get spread across top closers and bottom closers, right? But you just always want to make sure that those top top top people land with the top top top reps because if not, you're bleeding out on places that are like yeah in in the good fashion. So let's jump over to the raised hands and then we'll go or Tom has another one in here. Tom has another one. Uh then I'll go back to those. Uh I spoke to Nate management community and I mean he said you guys increase cash a ton from financing. Yeah. So we did when Nate was there and then on the tail end of when Nate was there. So Nate's great. Nate took us So some context on our our sales team structure. So we ran it ourselves like me and Luke were running the sales team. We onboarded the first hundred and something. We managed them. We took sales calls. Like we did all that to start and then as the team grew we tried to do sales. We actually we did the classic take your top rep and make them the manager which is the dumbest thing in the world and we didn't know that and uh we did that and everything exploded. So sales management exploded, culture exploded. We had to fire half the team. It was like a complete mess. Um and then the next layer was us trying to manage it ourselves then trying to do sales agencies through closers IO and stuff. Love those guys but like just wasn't a good fit for the external side. And then we tried to do uh 1099 external agency management, but it wasn't structured how it is today where it's like 20% flat fee. If it was that, I would do that all day back in the day, but now not now where we're at. And then we got Nate, we poached Nate kind of uh from Pompa and he had the high he was the largest pod leader of PMPA. So he had gotten up to three million a month in cash collected. We had only ever done a million a month in cash collected. And so we brought him over and we got up to 3 million a month of cash collected and then we stalled out. And uh Nate was great. Um but also a big portion of that is we added a firm as our financing partner and we're allowing 24 months financing and like 50 plus% of our closes were going through external financing which is not the model. I am not a fan of that and I don't think that we should have done that and can't go back in time but it really hurt retention a lot. So it's like we ramped a ton of new people but they any any external financing person for us was the highest refund rate, the highest chargeback, the most complaining, the most whatever and also the most unlikely to retain and like you know go into the next year. So now it's 15% maybe uh of our current and we are looking at some other options. We just got approved for split it. Um some people use some other external things. They'll occasionally link them to credit cards but yeah that's the that's what we ended up using. Um so let's go. I don't know which one in order of hand raises, but go for it. Tamir, who we got? Who we got? I see three. Tamir, you're up. Yeah. So, I had one question specifically about um your sales team when it comes. So, you guys are majority uh female reps. Yeah. Yeah. I think we have one or two males right now of 22 reps. Yeah. That's sick. How are you guys sourcing good quality female reps? It's been a big uh challenge. Yeah. So like to give you a point of reference, the most recent sales rep is sales rep ID number 376. So we are on our 376th hire for this. Um so our entire team is W2 now. On here I see one, two, there's two males of the current active roster that's now 23. Um and then main sourcing. So we've had some really good referrals. uh we kind of like have become we've become more known now in the space so where like the lead flow almost exists as like organic and referral. Um but for the longest time the very first batch came from community. So we hired from our clients and those ones crushed for us. So when we were selling the info product, it was a,000 bucks or 1,500 at one point over the phone and uh everybody who was on the sales team was a client of the product and then we taught them the scale the sales skills and the CRM skills and that was really good. But then when we changed the offer to instead of the info product to the coaching which was six times the price it was not good because one their belief and they hadn't bought that product right so like they weren't somebody who had spent 7K so to try and sell something 7K I think there was like a belief dissonant like you know mis congruent or whatever um so that was one thing then we tried to do the remote closer sicko classic style which I'm sure you guys are all familiar with the internet marketing high ticket sales cruise and like they crush. But like for us, we're selling to 46 year old women, 40 to 60 year old women and it's just not the vibe. Like we will have people who specifically say to the men, "Oh, I want to talk to a female only." Like they'll get booked with a male and they will message in and say, "I'm not taking this call unless I'm with a female." So like it's been a thing for us. Um but there's they're W2 now, not 1099. So we do have some, you know, there's like legality around only hiring this or that. Uh so we navigate that clear clean. Um, but we've now I mean to direct answer the question everywhere like we we'll get a new closer and they'll be like, "Oh, my two friends are closers and we need them." We've tried out of Shelby Sap's community. We've tried out of Closers. io. We've tried out of nothing held back group. We've tried Nate's recommendations. We've tried like we have such an inflow now. We have like 90 in the pipeline sitting right now that just sit there and like the most recent three that You mind sending me a few? Huh? You mind sending me a few? Yeah. Well, I heard of uh I made a post about this when I was trying to hire a sales manager and like six people linked to software or not software like a marketplace that all these guys pay that's I'm pretty sure there's like two or three of them but they basically upload all their stats in there. You pay 250 bucks a month or 250 something and like there Yeah. Like I think it's that one actually. It's mainly men though. Yes. Yeah. And then I I love the like Shelby's business model. Um, but I have I I don't have a ton of experience knowing like if that those are quality reps or if they you know because a lot of them are obviously beginners then getting into the space. I don't know how much training and stuff they need. They're pretty good. I hired two hired two from her and they they crushed it. Yeah. So like I think that is a good example of especially if you're trying to source female only. Um but yeah, depending on what the product is, getting them from the client base is huge if you can leverage that correctly. It's like you you basically have super oversimplified, but you have like the belief and the product and like the understanding here and then you have like the sales skill, the tech, the ability to do this like if you were to bucket it and if you can get someone who has this piece and then teach them what they need to know in the sales skills and the tech and like your systems versus all these high ticket people come in with this without any other product and it's like sometimes that can just be not good, right? Sometimes they can bully, they can push over the line, they can not understand, they can offer stuff in the program that's not included. you have that whole like fight of CS product and sales because it's like you promised them like nine extra one-on-one calls just to get them over the line and like we don't fulfill on that. Like you have to navigate that. Um but yeah, Shel's a good one and then there's a couple other ones. There's uh uh her last call I think is another one that's will um will change lives on Instagram. Yeah, his him and his girlfriend I believe uh have one. So, but again, those are going to be like your young gun shot out of a cannon, like high ticket for female. Uh, if you want the older kind of age demo, you got to you got to snipe them. Like, we just got one that came from Gym Launch. Uh, Publishing.com is apparently downsizing uh and they're doing a bunch of changes there. So, a ton of their closers are on the hunt, so we have a pipeline of those guys. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, what what would it take in order for me to maybe source like one or two reps from your bench? I mean, they're not going to be the good ones. Or or is that a complete No. No. I mean, I I don't even know. I don't like I could train I could train good. I could train good. I I I don't So, here's a better question is so for you guys, how do you currently hire or how do you currently source? Yeah. So mainly mainly just like referrals and people we know in the network in the info space that run kind of you know the make 10k a month is high ticket closer offer those kind of communities job post and stuff like that. Yeah. So for us so at one point in time we bought and owned high ticketfitnesscloers.com and we built an entire uh funnel for this. So we ran ads that then went to a VSSL funnel that was Luke and like going through an application funnel populated into a full like imagine you're running a salesunnel but you're running it for hiring and that's what any of like the big dogs say they do at scale is you need that. So you're going to have roles like an HR director that you're going to oneoff snipe and hire or whatever a senior tech lead or whatever. Um and then you're going to have evergreen roles. So for us our two core evergreen roles are going to be our coaches so to fulfill on the product and our sales reps. So we have those constantly. That's why that pipeline looks like that is because we've been in sales management transition. So we haven't been onboarding new people. So the pipeline has built up, right? So same thing with coaches. We haven't been hiring for coaches because we have x amount of open spots. And then we wait until we get to a point where it's like, yeah, we're ready for more volume. And then we go into there and hire from those pipelines. You constantly need to fill that bench. So whether it's a hiring funnel, it's classic. It's exactly what you'd imagine. It's traffic sources, whether that's Indeed, whether that's referrals, whether that's whatever. They sit in an application bench. They move from an application bench to a group coaching bench. They go from group coaching to singular approvals and then move into onboarding. It's like the classic flow. So, you just need to standardize and get consistency around the inflow. If you're trying to scale a little bit more aggressively, if you're trying to just snipe, then you just snipe them. Then you just find the best of the best. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. I appreciate it. Keep up with the content. It's uh good. I'm trying. I'm stopping at 100, so we'll see what happens after 100. I'm at 90. Okay, Chris, don't stop, man. Don't stop. I'll see if I'll see if I can get Iman on tomorrow when I'm there. But, um, all right. Who else was We had these two hand raises and then I'll go through the next question. Tristan, I'll go a quick one. Um, how highly do you value the uh low ticket ascension funnel? very except currently um if you look at here or let me do so currently what we looked at after a while on ours was ours is not cold friendly enough. So for us let's say call it 5% ascend. So you're going to have a 100 low ticket purchases that are going to come through here and you're going to have five that pop out as clients let's just say which is a great ascension rate. Um if we're trying to do 20 units a day I need to sell 400 of these a day. this funnel and how it's framed and what the product is and how all of that cannot do 400 a day. So the economics are on they work but as soon as we get over call it 50 75 whatever units of this a day it breaks and the economics breaks. So then the funnel no longer works and that is because of how it is framed right now is too low on the awareness or however you want to look at it to it is the it is framed as something that is not cold friendly. We can't we can't vsh this and sell 500 or a thousand units a day in this current model. So this mainly acts as almost like not retargeting necessarily but 50% of the people that purchase this are somewhere that have already been inside our VSSLs are already in our ecosystem are already in our CRM have consumed our content. So the economics work for that but it doesn't work at cold scale. So the new iteration of this is essentially this one down here and it's completely different framing. It's built for cold. It's mass market like uh Moves Method is a good example. They run tons of volume uh and they're in the fitness space. The I think it's women's fitness specific. Um they're out of Australia and they do millions a month right now and it's all from low ticket and then they have uh Ascension on the back end for high ticket. But their model and their their offer is framed in a way that's friendly to cold. So right now it's very low volume for us in terms of like we'll do 20 plus units a day and only a couple will pop through through this and a majority are going to come through here and then some through here. So it's basically like call it 70% 10% 20% maybe right now. Um but the goal is to get this much higher because the other thing is once you can spend 100 grand a day on ads your brand awareness is way up way way up right because they're seeing your eyeballs or like their eyeballs are on it which is good for us at scale. Um, but it doesn't make sense to spend into these ones because of the availability, right? You get fully booked at 200, 400, whatever calls a day that here you don't have that issue because you're liquidating and you're making you're making some of your spend back. So, yes, I think that answered that. But yeah, this is going to be a big direction of the future for us. It's just we haven't cracked it on cold to where we can sell 250 of them a day at a good cost. What are you guys selling as the actual low ticket product? The reason that I ask is like we have a huge organic audience that we're looking to basically leverage because a lot of guys are starters and they don't really have a lot of money. Um, so we want to leverage and kind of, you know, ascend them into, okay, I made $1,000 using your onetime purchase, $49 thing. And then now I feel like I have the social proof or the proof that I can invest into learning to make 10 grand. Um, and we're kind of leveraging trying to figure out like how we're going to do that. So ours is uh the ultimate guide to macronutrients which again is like only somebody who has the awareness of what macronutrients are or interested in that versus like a 7-day metabolism reset which is more mass market and cold friendly. So a big issue I see a lot of people do is like if in your case they'll sell something that either solves too much of the problem or is not congruent with what the upsell and backend is. So you'll sell a thousand units of something and no one will ascend because you either solve their problem too much here or because what you sold here doesn't directly like ladder them to the next thing. So our example of selling an ultimate guide to macronutrients gets their feet wet, gets them understanding the macros, understanding kind of like their customization a little bit based on some cookie cutter style stuff. It's not cookie cutter actually, but it's it's just the macronutrient part. And then the upsell and the ascension is what you really need is onetoone coaching. What you really need is, you know, transitions from body phase to body phase. What you really need is like all of these other customizations and onetoone help. And that's this next step. And like this is still very valuable on its own is a big core thing is like they have to feel like they get so much value. We're like done with the days of just launching a low ticket over a weekend that we just decided to spin up to make cash. Like ours take weeks to build because they're like full products. So you have to make sure that it's, you know, a bite, a small bite of the main apple that leads them to the next thing. So basically build your dream offer of what your backend thing is, then peel it away, peel it away, peel it away, and find the little chunk that you can sell up front to get them to the next piece or sell them the thing that is like the Alen Sultanic model is basically you're selling the same thing across the whole like golden thread, but you're just selling different layers of implementation is another way to look at it. So basically you'll sell the entire package, everything, but this person has to go through every video, every step and do it themselves and have no help doing it. The middle that's going to be the mid ticket or high ticket is going to be doing it with them either in a group setting and then the top tier is doing it onetoone with your help and that's like classic hormos on sultanic whatever the ascension pyramid comes with your time and their likelihood they think they're going to achieve that result which at the top tier is working direct one-on-one with you with all your stuff your personalization done for them whatever and then down here is like here's all the information just figure out how to do it on your own right so like you just have to make sure you tier the ladder in the right way and that there's flow because if there's not flow then you're just wasting time and resources. Yeah, appreciate you, man. Yeah. Next. Hi, Ryan. Nice to meet you. How we doing? Nice to meet you. We're doing good. So, uh, my question is, uh, I run an info agency and I'm looking to launch an offer in the Danish market where I'm from and I've been looking at some different niches and I've come to figure out that I think financial advisory based on also your videos would be a great niche to go into because you can have like a huge backend to monetize if done correctly, right? Um, and my question is that I haven't found any models in other countries where they sell something which is high ticket in the front end. Um, do you know of any models where it's possible to sell something which is very expensive in the front end? Because the only one I've been able to find find is like Dave Ramsey. Um, and he only like his whole model is basically helping the big population, right? And and sell something which is very cheap. Um, and it's really hard to get the wheels rolling when it's cheap. Yeah. Cash flow tactics. Yeah. So, I talk about this a couple times. So, I spun one of these up when I was So, okay. So, Warrior Babe at one point was just going to be a cash flow info coaching business. So, in doing so, I was all the tech and systems and structure, not really the ops. Like, it didn't it didn't require ops because it was only doing 10 10 million bucks a year. Everyone ran their bucket. uh as we've now chosen to go into like this big big game of like let's go to hundreds millions a year and like go direct response heavy backend multiple SKs full sea level whole thing um I so all to say on the side I was doing random gigs I was like building random things I was making money over here doing this and this and one of them at the time this had just launched and I was friends with an a whole life insurance rep okay so he was an agent that sold whole life insurance through infinite banking it's called which is like a really common thing in in the US uh as a known thing. So, this had just launched. These guys were in uh inner circle for ClickFunnels. So, Russell Brunson's like mastermind and he basically positioned I don't even know. Let's see what they're selling today. But when they initially sold this, they ran a webinar funnel that was direct to cart and I'm pretty sure it was a $2,000 offer and they basically taught people how to uh you know escape the rat race in 10 years or less, right, without Wall Street. And like this was their claim, but they were selling a 2K product that was a course. And in the entire time of the course, it was teaching them how to do real estate investing, how to escape their this, this, this, and this. But you have to use this vault to do it. Like there's this great way to do it using this vault. This vault, this vault, not like book a call. So they just nobody knows their numbers, but let's say they're breaking even. Let's say it was costing them $2,000 to acquire a customer for $2,000. They were breaking even on the info coaching side of the business, but then people were booking in a call to talk to them about the vault. And the vault was whole life insurance. And then they were selling 100k, 500k, million-doll policies. And we're making whatever the let's, you know, let's lowball and say 25% commissions. And then they're adding them to their insurance book. And then the idea being with whole life insurance is you can lend against it. So you can put 100k in, you have instant access to 80k, call it, and then you're going to take you're going to borrow that 80k out to use it in real estate. So you have your money working in more than one place in right. So it becomes this education around the financial instrument that you can use. People do this with taxation. There's another big guy that I'm forgetting his name, but he was at Onyx and theirs is all framed around taxation. So it's for business. It's like for if you're a business owner that does over 100k this and this. We we refuse to use financing because if you have to use financing to purchase our product, you don't have enough money to work with us. like that whole framing and gambit. They get inside there and then they use them for financial management. They have estate uh attorneys. They have insurance guys. They have like their whole rolodex of everything you need once you're somebody who's worth 10 million, 30 million, $100 million. You need an estate attorney, you needed this, you needed this, you need a this. And it's their referral partners out. So, this was more beginner friendly, like teaching somebody who already has a couple hundred grand, someone who's 40 to 60 years old, call it, that's basically just wants to like retire in 10 years or less. and it's teaching them how to get passive income to replace their active, doing it through real estate, but oh, you really need to do it through this financial instrument and real estate. And then they also owned the real estate company. So, they owned a brokerage that did the real estate portion where they already had done for you flips. They had uh ARMS where you could do um what do they call it? Hard money lending or that bridge finance stuff. So, they had it so you could do it for other members and they had a fund. They had like all these other monetization methods. So to my I I think if I'm like do not quote me on this but I think they did 10 million in 10 months I think with the info coaching and who knows how many tens and tens and tens on the back end and they have a thriving community. They've then cross sold them other things. They've had other products when the world went to [ __ ] and they were all like everyone was concerned about what's happening in financial markets. They had other products and things to sell them. So that's why I say that industry. Um, I ran a VSSL call funnel direct instead of doing this with info coaching because my brain wasn't on yet and I didn't understand how that worked. I could only see this far. So, I just ran the same VSSL callunnel we run in Warrior Babe for that and they were getting crazy qualified leads, but because the consumption wasn't there, they weren't actually purchasing. You're talking to a 55-year-old to move a million dollars out of their 401k and it just was very unlikely to happen because they didn't have the trust built the consumption, they hadn't purchased anything, they hadn't whatever. So that's why I say run info coaching with beautiful backends. Don't just go straight to the back end. That's why I say that because I did it and it didn't work. So you need the consumption. You need the people to come from buyers because if they're going to do this huge trust act thing with you, which is millions of dollars they're going to move or whatever large portions of their net worth, it's probably a better way to say it into whatever vehicle or asset management or whatever. You need to have the trust built. And that's why you have the Ramsies of the world that have so much content that it works. That's why you have these guys that have courses. That's why you have these guys that have books and courses around this as well. Um I'm forgetting the other one. It's like but like I have like four of these books. All these these are the guys that run BookFunnels, right? Because they want you to sit there with them for six hours and read them and think in their words because you need the consumption before you do anything with all of your money, right? So that's why I say this market. I don't specifically know for your country and for your market what does or doesn't work. what I'm talking like I can promise you if these financial instruments exist in your market then this will work. It just it creates it's a bigger moat and it's there's a reason a lot of people don't do it is because the consumption around this. There's another guy on uh Instagram that's uh let me see if I can find him because I just want to show you one more example. But the rule of thumb is like if I don't get it completely wrong, they sell to an audience which al already has money, right? Not the family father. Yeah, you have more room for uh error. So like this guy right here does the same thing except he does it through organic. So this guy partnered with a big uh agency. So, he's an agent himself and he does all these videos and directly calls out whole life insurance, whole life insurance, uh, infinite banking, has super long form YouTube videos and does all this and he makes ungodly amounts of money. And all he does is then point them over here. They go to the training, right? The infinite banking and it's a VSSL funnel that they opt in for on a GHL and that's it. And they will opt into a VSSL funnel, but they've consumed his content prior. They go through this and then he has people inside his agency that he's like partnered with and because he's licensed that's the other big play for you. I don't know how your monetization model is set but I got licensed so I could be on the cases because it's illegal to be on the cases and get a percentage of the revenue unless you're actually licensed as an agent. So you can only in our market I don't know again about your country. It's the same in Denmark. Yeah. So you have to get licensed in order to be on the cases which does offer risk by the way or does introduce risk into it. Uh or you have to get paid as a like a flat fee. So, you have to be like, I get paid five grand for every case you place because you know the average commission is 40k or whatever number. Um, you you either need to know your numbers or you need to get licensed and go through the process if you want to be attached. That's the big big game because if you have hundreds of these policies, you get like first year commission bumps, you hit like thresholds. Like these agencies are crazy. If you have x amount of units, you get invited to Rome to go to all the conferences. Like there's all these like fun things if you're like a because then you're a top insurance producer because you're on a million cases. But there is risk to that because if things do happen, you are on the case for negative and positive. So this is one way. I do know people who do the same thing uh in affiliate and lead genen mass scale where they just fire off the leads and get paid 20 bucks per call. But that's a different game. That's like live transfers and live calls. But if we're talking info coaching, this is how these guys work. That makes sense. And if you were to start again, that would be the same model you would go about. I would build this. I would build this. Yeah. I bet I could build this into like 250 million a year. Yeah. Yeah. It would take me take me years and years to do and I the biggest thing is the partners too. It's definitely the partners, but the these are [ __ ] huge. Huge. And these guys don't know info coaching like at the same level that like a lot of us do. I talk about this a lot, but like I think that I I got off a call earlier today that was somebody who's doing it in a sports niche. So I don't want to dox their stuff, but they do organic. They do a million a month with like a 5k offer cruising and they are uh uh for a specific like sport. So let's say like a soccer goalie or you guys say football, I don't know, you know what I mean? A goalie. Uh and they basically have such a pipeline. They have they're so good at it. It's remote and in person. So they have a facility that's like their office but also has like training center and whatever. And uh people will do remote and in person. And they have people who have been drafted. They have people who become all stars. They have like basically the whole tranches of like think about it like the most is going to be your like middle school, high school, college, pro, allstar, whatever. And they have like thousands, low thousands, hundreds, you know, tens. They have insane insane results. And their backend play is massive because they can I mean, you guys know, I'm sure, but the comp packages for sports and how you want to tie and play that out and theirs is the same thing. So this is a bigger backend because of how financial markets and all that kind of stuff work and like the the tools and instruments you can use. But this is just the biggest thing is the content engine and the partners of this. You can build an info coaching around anything. I know a guy who has it about how to build the largest pumpkin or how to grow the largest pumpkin. So like it's I am such a fan of using internet marketing and info coaching on an industry that is not internet marketing and not info coaching. Right. So, we do it in fitness. These guys do it in some sports niche thing over here. That guy does it in pumpkin growing. I use the example on from my first million of the guy who did it with quilting. His mom had a quilting blog or YouTube channel or something and he was doing XYZ. Next thing you know, fast forward whatever 10 years, they have a city in the United States that people fly to and it is the quilting capital of the world or whatever and they own all the buildings and they have a shop that's all about the quilting stuff and they have one that's all about the metal and this and they have like all this stuff and people fly into this city that's in the middle of nowhere and the guy owns like 80% of the buildings in the town and has turned it into Disney World and it's like it started with info coaching small ecom thing and now they're a hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year So, it's like you can take any of these to the nth. It's just like which one wealth factory was Gunner uh was what's his name? Gunderson. Gunderson book. Uh Garrett Gunderson. He sold this. So Garrett Gunderson is the guy who wrote Killinga Sacred Cows and like this was his big book and like what would the Rockefellers do? And these were book funnels that he wrote in order to get people into Wealth Factory. And then he sold Wealth Factory. I feel like the only thing nowadays is like majority of people don't have the patience to do that. Like that's that's a total long-term game. Yeah. This is a total long-term game. But it's like, right, so they're just using a classic book a call funnel and then where does this web? You have no idea, right? But this is their entry point. And when they used to have it, they had 19 different courses. is I mean I'm sure I have a login for this. Oh no, they moved it on site. Yeah, portal, right? So they moved it all on site after they per got purchased. But these guys are essentially doing like a more direct version of um Oh, here's another one. Paradigm wealth or life or something. Paradigm life, I think. Yeah, these guys are another version of this. So it's this guy right here. He has books. He has whatever. And it's whole life insurance, ILs, like all these financial products in the back end. And it's the same thing. It's talk to an expert. It's a call funnel that comes through. And then they have courses where they sell products. That's any of their stuff. Sells these different things. So they have products right here. And then they have like full book funnels, full whatever. You walk through here, it educates you so much before you can even book a call. And then these are very high commissionable products. Well, long-term care products, premium financing, whole life term isn't that high. Annuities are right off the rip. And different ones have different qualification process. Your your time from lead to purchase or commission on like this is like instant on this is long on this is kind of instant long. And again, this isn't fully my game. So, I'm probably stepping out of my tone right here, but yeah, this is an example. Another example. I'll uh I'll pick a few questions from the chat I think are most relevant, but uh what's your opinion on organic versus ads in early stages like pre 100K a month uh content ecosystem versus VSSN fun? Yeah, I think organic is like truly goated. It just takes too long. So, if you're trying to test and iterate, that's the other thing is like who you've built into your organic audience or trying to test and like build up an audience in an organic thing is a lot harder. Um, if you want to shift your messaging or your target audience, it's much harder to shift, right? Because like you're building like true I have a sticky note here that's like every every one is someone and it's like it takes one like it's every addition is a different person that saw you in a different way versus an ad is directly targeted at a person very quick. You can spend five grand tomorrow and test like it's right now. So, we test with paid. Um, we've actually never in this business specific never like hammered organic other than for middle and bottom of funnel, but I talked to the guys like Eman and whatever, which is like a longer tail game, but it crushes and you get 30 to 40% more margin when you do organic because you're doing 3x rorowaz and you're just lighting that cash on fire or ideally not on fire, but to get 3x back or 5x or whatever. So, I I like paid off the rip no matter what. Uh, paid while growing organic though. What? Paid while growing organic. Yes. Always. Always growing organic and brand. And I wish we would have done that sooner and better and optimized around it and shelled out the cash and used like marketing budget that you would have spent on ads for content organic team and like done that in a better way. We're doing that now, but you know, 70s something million later, not off the rip. We have like a couple videos that have popped off which is just annoying. We have so much content. Yeah. Okay. What are the best incentives/ bonuses for setters closure that you've tested so far? I know you guys have a pretty healthy uh bonus structure. Yeah. Um yeah, we're already kind of talking about how we're going to shift and change that and align it better because we want you want top performers to make top money, right? Like you want your top performers. So our top reps have made over 400 and something a year. Um we've had multiple that have hit that. So what is the cash collected amount versus what they should take home and like that game and then what is the what is top performance pay for somebody in that role right and backing into that. So a top rep is 400 grand let's just say in that number. So now how much cash collected can they do and then backing into the percents. So for us it's kind of pretty close to the classic 10% and then we have some bonus pools. Uh when we had everyone as 1099 we really needed coverage on the weekends. So we created basically that they would get like a a multiplier effect uh on the weekends. So they would open up more times on the weekends so we could get more stability because availability is an issue and that's hard to change ad budgets from 30K a day to 20K a day for just two days. So you're just kind of burning cash on either end, however you look at it. Uh either opportunity cost or literal cost. So for us the current model is 8, nine, and 10% based on how they sit uh on team. So basically what their sales per booking is which is a function of sale uh show rate and close rate. The what I want to move into and what ours is really kind of closely based off of is cash collection week overw week. So our pay periods are two weeks long. If it was weekly if it was monthly just do the same math and then figure out what your tranches are for cash collected and have different percents tied to those. So an example of that is like under 100k 100 to 200 and 200k plus let's just say and then you would have your anchors around that. So you'd have eight 8% 9% 10%. So as they hit the higher thing and were performing over that week, they would already be making more money, but now they get more as a percentage of it as they climb. And those are the most those are the most successful ones I've seen. And then mini contests like who can get the most units in a day. If someone can get, you know, a hat trick, they get a steak dinner, they can get their nails done, they do whatever. Like there's a bunch of those that randomly happen. Um but yeah, that's what we've seen for And then it like so how we actually actually our current state their W2 so they have a draw base of whatever the federal minimum is for the US 45 grand a year uh that is a draw. So as soon as they go over that in commission it's replaced by the commission not in addition right they're making their eight n or 10% and then we have bonus pools that are based on uh points which it gets kind of confusing but points are just one to one of cash collected and on the weekends it's 1.5x. So, we have like this point tracker thing that sits over here that like as they get to it, they get 3K, 6K, 9K, and 12K in bonuses for the pay period. Um, which shores out a little high honestly on uh on percentage of paid to sales team when the team is cruising, but like you want top reps to make top money. So, top rep and that'll make 14% call it when they hit everything, which is high. So is there like a maximum uh percentage you have in mind or on paper that you're like my dream state for the entire department is 15 points and that's just unrealistic right when you have all those people at that. So we're going to mess with it as we get more at scale because now that the reps are performing better uh we might have to adjust it a little but that's not really directly on the radar with all the other changes. Um I know sales agencies right now out of the box do 20% almost like like I know guys that do 20. I know guys that do 25. So if an agency does 20, why can't you do in-house? Ideally, you can do in-house and save money, right? It's like the idea. But the agencies have economies of scale with how they do sales management hires where they can have four or five and it drops as a percentage. So we have a we have a chief of sales, we have an outbound director, like a setter manager, we have all the setters, which we didn't have setters until 72 million. We zero. We only did closers and tons of volume. And then a closer team. So it's like those four comp plans when stacked on top of each other are 20ish% right now. Really? Okay. Um what is the onboarding process? That's ramp up time that you've seen that works best for closers as in like would be closers training closures the sales manager training one to one to manny. Yeah. So the initial flow is a group interview and then they get approved by the sales ops coordinator or in the past it's been the d the manager. Uh we're trying to centralize that. So the sales ops person sits between setter and closer and approves everyone as like the double check. They then begin the onboarding process and we have a talent experience manager that specifically does that. Um that's like her role. So she makes sure they're in the system. She does some like ramping. We have pitch decks basically like onboarding presentations they go through and then once they get through that they go over to um uh the sales op. They basically go into a dedicated Slack channel that's like an onboarding onboarding cohort and then they start to get their first calls. they will sit in that bottom bucket to start and we'll get like the DQ which is all leads just not the top top tier leads, right? So, they do get good quality in there. It's not to say we just throw them all [ __ ] We just like make sure the top leads get to the top sales reps and then everything else shores out between top and bottom. Um, and then yeah, we've bounced around with this number, but it's essentially what is your cost per booking and what is a fair amount of money to invest slash like at bats before you either pull the plug or they're ready to like full go. So for us that's danced around 50 to 80 callsish. Uh that is like that's a fair assumption. And if they can't get it turned around and start getting some sales from that and like some good metrics then and then of course all I don't want to say the soft stuff but like the activity level stuff. Are they showing up to all the meetings? Are they bringing their call recordings? Are they filling out their numbers? Are they you know taking good feedback? And there's a lot of oneto ones that occur. We do weekly oneto ones with the uh chief of sales for setters and closers. Um they have five meetings a week. So a daily huddle on weekdays um that occur and then the the first one is the only one different that's like expectations and you know projections for the week. Everything else is just tied back to that and the cadence is very number driven and around there. And I do want to quick touch on this but like we have the same sales team that we had two months ago. Um and we just got different sales management. And I this is no shame or [ __ ] on our past sales management or whatever. It's just kind of like an example of culture and how things are led. With the same sales team, the same lead flow, the same volume, the same call, everything. We went from 1.6 million to 3 million last month with a new sales manager with two less reps. What do you feel like he pulled differently? He came in and just completely set the tone of the energy, the expectation of hours, the expect the script they should use, the pitch deck, like all these things. But just off the rip of the energy shift and how we're now leading by numbers, people didn't know their close rates. People didn't know their offer rate. People didn't know like these kind of simpler things. They were getting calls reviewed at the same thing. And again, this is no [ __ ] on past management at all. This is just like an example of some of the things that can change when there's like a cultural and energy shift. And last month, we almost hit peak uh our our record for new cash collected. And this month we're definitely pacing our record which is crazy. Long-term five 10 year vision on the infospace direction with AI information that uh democratization uh trust bad players etc. Yeah. Um twofold. One I think that right now everything's already completely democratized and free on the internet completely. So I think you already can access anything on YouTube or in whatever way like can already do that. Um, but the new layer of AI has personalization that didn't exist before. So before you could find anything about any call funnel type or how to run this or that or do any of that stuff very easily. Um, but it wasn't applicable to you specifically in your use case. And now AI makes it so that is the case. You can take all the context of here's how this person talked about running a callunnel or this AI flow or this whatever workflows. you can feed that all in and then you can give it your specific use case and then it can marry those. So I do think that there's going to be a layer of info coaching that gets eaten or gets you know is gone because of that. Um, I think it would be unfair to realize not, but I think as being on the front of it with what we do is building it in right now where you can get it with efficiencies internally and use it to make more money now and then just making sure that you can do the same thing with product, right? is like you can do it internal to your product, but the second you start to show how the process works or how easy or light it is for you, like a really good and kind of s like funny example of this is like my dad has a landscape and storm removal company and they had guys that would shovel the sidewalk and it would cost $100 an hour to have those guys do it, right? They then got tractor things that could go on the sidewalk instead and it was one the cost. So example or the example there is like AI and I was like oh perfect now you can charge $25 an hour and like beat everyone. He's like no we're going to charge $100 still. We're just gonna it's going to be cheaper for us to fulfill on it. And it was like it was like 10 years ago when he said that to me and it like stuck so hard because I'm like oh so you get efficiencies through these things whether it's group coaching whether it's AI whether it's whatever. You can still charge the same rate because you're getting them the same result but it costs you less to do it right. So using it like that right now and then over time figuring out the way to use it in your actual product in a way that's like acceptable by the market or that you're leveraging all the expertise you have laid inside one of these AIs and then their personalization comes in. It's still I don't like you can get every Harvard class for free right now online and it's like people aren't going there. People are still paying people 10 grand to learn it because you have the experience because you've done it which is a biggest one because you have the modeled that information in an easy to consume way with a clear path from A to Z. So I think that's going to exist forever. Okay. Uh would it be applicable to run a low ticket ascension model for a B2B agency? No 100% do that. I know people who do that for templates is a big one. So people will be like, "Here's the SOPs that I use to consistently get clients for my agency or here's how I do it to, you know, only have five hours of management per client per month in my agency." And then people download these, you know, ClickUp board templates or notion temp or whatever. And then it leads them into booking a call on how to implement that in their company. And then it's like, "Okay, cool. Why did you buy just this little thing instead of apply for our like coaching?" And they're like, "Oh, it's your coaching." It's like, oh, well, every result on the website is from us personally building this into the companies because we actually add this, this, this, this, and this. I think the main um B2B in regards to to service based businesses. Yeah, same thing. Same thing. So, you should the niche down. So, like I use my landscape example. Um, Hormosi has one on this too. It's like a time management course can be sold like this and then you break it down to a time management for landscape professionals or landscape professionals that have one to 10 employees and you can sell it for more and be more unique with it. And yeah, that's definitely the model. You just have to niche down if you're going to do it in the service level. That makes sense. Okay. Have you tried lead forms? And if so, what was your experience at testing it? Facebook specifically forms in I assume. Yeah. So, yeah. Um, no, not for what we do here. Um, we I've done it in lead genen an affiliate um and done it for some localized stuff, but not for not for this because we want the consumption to exist. So like kind we've Yeah. No, not not at scale for us. I'm sure I'm sure it works. I actually know people who do it, but they do it more for when they have call centers and they have dials that they can do. Final questions, boys. I got time. So I have one on expanding on the uh B2B low ticket. Um so if your primary demographic is mostly BTOC, right? So guys starting service-based businesses. um how would you position that low ticket? Right? Because if you do like an SOP, yeah, the guys starting are going to also consume that, but technically you're kind of targeting more the guy who's doing between zero and 10K and he wants to systemize the business. And that's not mostly what your demographic is. So for someone who's 0 to 10K, they want acquisition, not systemization generally, right? Like lead genen. Yeah. Yeah. So like you're So you're saying you're tr the market your ICP is someone who's 0 to 10k to get into agency, right? No. So it's the offer is helping guys start service- based businesses like home services. Um it's going to be like window cleaning, permanent lighting installation, all that stuff. And so our primary demographic is going to be guys who are, you know, uh don't enjoy their job or they're looking to, you know, pivot career-wise uh or just looking to make some side income. And so they're starting out. So, for me, it's like, okay, well, we can make an easily sellable $9 SOP document, but that doesn't really Yeah. get assumed by that starter guy. Yeah. So, what's what's the back end off or what's the current full offer? Uh, it's ongoing mentorship and coaching at like a average 6 to 8K price point. Um, and we basically help you with everything like the services themselves, how to systemize, add uh SOPs, we'll help you with your lead genen. Um, but it's also very self-guided. So, it's like group coaching. Yeah. So, you want to pull away from that as much as possible. And what's the front front? What is the first thing that is in their head that you're solving for? So whether it is how to get your first client as a home ser like I don't know the necessarily the answer but it's like how to get your first client as home services how to make your first dollar doing this how to like I I've seen a lot of guys do like which is interesting to me that you're doing it as multiple home services because I've seen guys who crush it in like how to do a car detailing business right like how to start a car detailing one or how to start a window one they have the whole franchises that are around painting and all that kind of stuff and it's like picking your angle and finding the lowest because you want like you want it to be niche but you want it to work for cold. So you want it to be for someone as like the very first entry point. I don't specifically know what it is in your but if you break out your coaching thing and it's like where do they start right now and then just chunk that off as something you can sell. So, not an SOP, you're 100% right, but something that's like how to get your first client or how to um the 10 the 10step checklist to launch your home service business, right? Like checklist, stuff like that. That's like very easy to consume plug-andplay. Like that's what sells for $7 and 17 and 27. So, like here's your uh quick start your your your 12 bullet checklist to start a homebased business or a home services business or whatever and then sell sell that and then instantly have your uh you can on stuff like that that's a little bit different I think because it can make sense to have upsells and downells and to then you have to build out multiple products. Uh I do like the just direct ascension. So, it's like they buy that and then it's like now book on book your onboarding call so we can make sure you understand the things on this checklist and you have the you have the resources you need and drop them into a little portal and a free school gur group or whatever or I guess that's paid but a paid school group and then just have them all in there and then just nurture that and the call same thing that I said earlier which is like hey cool you got this but I didn't I see that you didn't actually apply for like our our coaching whatever like to do quick start whatever and they're like oh I didn't even know that existed and you're like yeah well everyone on the website all the case studies you see all the stuff everyone who's actually gotten And you know, a ton of like uh success in this has gone through our coaching program because we offer personalization onetoone and this and this and like they're like, "Oh, that's cool. Yeah, you want to talk to somebody?" And then they book them with the closer. Yeah. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. We've been floating the idea of like uh there's this these people that the offer owner saw recently. It's like subscription kings. um doing like a three-step ascension to where for us it would be okay make your first 500 bucks with home services and then ascend to make your first get your first $1,000 day and then you would that would be like the logical next step to okay now you're ready for coaching you know what I mean yeah we're looking at some guy's thing the other day this might have been you I don't know but someone was saying I think it might have been home services but they were like learn how to make $650 a day uh in home services and it was like someone would purchase it and then And we were looking at the Otto page. I It was yesterday actually in the in the video I put on YouTube. And then the next page was like ready to scale to 20K months like book your call. And it was like like the frame like made no sense. It was like what's 650 a day then monthly is what? Like that's what 18 grand. Like is that different? And it's like they haven't even done the thing in step one. They just purchased the thing to learn how to get to 650 a day. And then the Otto instantly is like ready to scale to 20K months. And it's like they don't even know what the 650 a day thing is. and you're jumping day versus month and like it just didn't make sense. So the flow is so important that I think that the ascension ones that crush it. We get 70% booked call rate from low ticket purchase to implementation call. So it's like you get all those people on the phone and can talk to your customers and then can change your low ticket because you hear this and this and you can change the framing or you can you know you get like so much feedback loop. That's why I love call funnels because you have so much room for error and so much like margin for and like feedback loop versus someone just lands on a page, buys something, you're like, "Oh, 2.2%. How do I make it 2.4?" It's like you have no true feedback loop. Yeah. Appreciate you, man. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good one. Good question. Anything else for Ryan, boys? Yeah, man. What's up, Ryan? What's up? I got a question. Um, how do you guys analyze sales calls and reverse engineer that into the funnel? Painstakingly. Um, it's much easier now with AI. Um, so we have HubSpot now out of the box, I think, has it or at least our plan has it. So, it'll give you AI summary of the call. Um, for the longest time in the OG days, it was like a feedback. It was basically the end of day reports. So, everyone submits their end-to-day reports. They go into one collection thing and then they just basically get pushed over to marketing like things that are highlighted. So, a sales ops or sales manager will find things and be like, "Oh, seven, excuse me, 70% of these are like broke or everyone keeps bringing up this thing where they're all talking about menopause all of a sudden instead of macronutrients or what you mean just the feedback loop." Now, we use Zoom revenue accelerator. We built an in-house tool that does the same thing, but it's basically like trans like calls done. You can do these end to end. You can do zap. You can do whatever. It's done. Feed it into AI. Give the summary points and then like act as a this this to say how would marketing change things based on this and then summarize those all into one and then resummarize them again and then fire that off to marketing. So we use Zoom revenue accelerator. It costs X amount of dollars. Gong did it for a really long time for like 100 grand a year. It was dumb. And then now you can do it yourself pretty easily. So you're separating that between the different parts of the business. That's interesting. Yes. What's the EOD forms that you have closers fill out? Because I'm sure that there's things that closers know that the Let me pull up their most recent. They have they have a new iteration one, but now the new manager is having them do it for every single call, drop the call recording link and drop their like notes and feedback on them into one form. So we standardize them through a jot form where they basically go through like how do they rank them, how many calls they do, like the inputs of like how many were on calendar, how many were live, how many were this or this instead of putting it in the spreadsheet like the closer IO one. So they fill that all out and it pushes into there and then there's the box that's down in the bottom that's like the contextual feedback and they fill all that in and then those all go into one master like log and then from there you can AI that entire log. Okay, cool. That's interesting. Yeah, I want to visualize that but that sounds super helpful. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's basically standardize the inputs. So, make a form in simple words, make a form, then have those all go into a database, a sheet or whatever, and then you can literally manually if you want, just grab all of them, feed them in somewhere, and then be like, give me the top keywords. Like for us, one of the examples was we did this with the customers in the end, and we're like, what is the uh what are like common words they use? What are this, this, and this of like a ton of feedback forms and a ton of them were saying like empower women, which is so interesting, right? because that's like it was kind of in our language but wasn't really and like that was a key thing is like oh this just a group of empowered women. It's like, "Oh, okay. Let's layer that messaging now up on the front and then the throughput is like right there." Or like we were doing things around um a lot around macronutrients because that was kind of hot for a minute and then all of a sudden we started to see things pick up around menopause, per menopause, where they're at with that stage. Menopause specific funnel 7x rorowaz instead of 3x like right. So like the feedback loop was like real. Yeah. Super cool. I love that. That's sick, man. uh as one. Yeah. Just uh I have uh one question for you. So I see a lot of guys online including guys like Brian Marada and Jeremy Haynes which really knows their stuff, right? Uh who talks a lot about hammering people with emails prior to uh people actually attending the call like in the framing window, right? And I've just been thinking about it and if it were any of my clients or if I were to sign up for something, I would be so annoyed if someone like spammed me with 15 emails and I've never seen anyone done it and I've funnel hacked hundreds of funnels. So what is your experience with that? Because I generally just send her everything in one page and then I just keep redirecting them to that one page where I have all of the information, right? Testimonials, pre-objection handling material, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So, I wish I had clean data for you and I don't, but I can give you soft data on this. So, we did this. So, we did every two hours after they after they booked a call, we hammered them with emails every two hours and we got some feedback that it was too much definitely. Um, but if you think of it in the scheme of things, we're booking 100 to 300 to five, whatever, 100 calls a day. And like if you're only hearing it a couple times like so I know as a consumer. So here's a great example. I booked a call with these ops kings guy and I was like I need their very basic website not allowed to consume. They redirected me they to nowhere when I booked a call. They then sent me an email and said sometimes the page is broken. Click here to go to the page. I click there page is broken. I email them back and say send meing everything you have before this call. Because as like an educated consumer and in like this B2B land, like I need to know everything before I make a decision and I don't want to sit on the phone with you for 45 minutes or an hour and have you like pitch me like where I'm at as a consumer or like this B2B land. Yeah, makes sense. That's not super common for BC at all. Right. They But the idea behind it is you're getting ahead of anything that could happen on the sales call so that by the time they're on the sales call is basically just like an onboarding, right? And that does not work for everyone because there needs to be a sales process sometimes to get people over the line and they're not just going to sell themselves through this education. So where we landed is we have two layers of this. So he has the ads side of things and he has the automation side of things. So on ads we do have the hammer them strategy that he talks about. So we have 15 pieces of content that are long form that are authority driven that are uh reviews long form testimonials all that stuff. And we have however many of those. They exist for people on a HubSpot sync list that have booked but have not had a call disposition yet. Right? So it's like booked calls within that 48 hour window. So that's anywhere from 200 to 400 people call it and then they get hammered with these ads. When they get a through play of one ad, they are now moved to the next and removed from that one. So they see a different ad over and over again, but you own their feed. You are everywhere you're on. And then we do the same thing on YouTube and uh on Pmax and everything. So we're everywhere on Google as well, our two core ones that we use. So we'll do that. And we saw a direct in increase when doing that. The next layer was the emails every two hours or so. So we send contextual emails and reminders from the sales rep specific from their email and their dedicated line. We have a setter reach out to them and call them and confirm the call. And then all those other emails that come every two hours are like authority and review driven whatever. And those are sending from the branded company email. So not to be like hammering from the sales rep. So they'll go from there directly and go through. Um, but yeah, so every two hours, I'm sorry, every two hours was too much for us and every four hours we've not heard a single message and we only send it on uh good hours because the whole thing is with email. It I have an actually terrible example of this, but we did this with text. So when we heard about that for the first time, we did it every two hours via text message and you would have thought we were like like harming families. Like that was not the move. text people are going to see like text people are going to see every two hours, four hours. An email, you know how many emails they get and like bounce through and they'll pick the one they want to see and they'll skip over the next one. Like email is not that big of a deal. That's why I even think two hours is not that big of a deal. Even if you get a couple complaints like, "Oh, you emailed me 90 times. I don't want to talk to you anymore." It's like, "Okay, then don't talk to us because we're aggressive and we like it anyway." Like, depending how you are, but if you do it via text or call or some of these other ones, no bueno. So, it's like ads easiest to get away with. Email second easiest to get away with. And then text and phone are like not even close. Okay. And do you redirect within the specific emails to the same page where they have all of the information? So the initial initial three will go through there and it's the classic like your calls now confirmed but you have to watch this video the proper frame video. Go to Alen Sultanic stuff. He talks about how to frame the video in a good way. And then it's pre-objection blocks or I'm sorry it's then it's here's what to expect. We're going to call you in the next five minutes from a XYZ uh area code. The call is make sure you know it's Zoom. Um, make sure you pop into your email and see an email like this and confirm it from an unknown sender. And then it's pre-objection blocks. It's the three core objection blocks that are the brand face being like how much does it cost? What do you mean how much does it cost? How much does it cost you to, you know, be overweight and do this and this and this and like do all that kind of stuff. And then like how does this work? How does whatever? And then it's just a testimonial wall. So we have mid form and long form that then exists within there. And that's all on one page. So the first three emails are going to point them back to there. And then there are other standalone pages that exist that are like a headline with a specific video and then testimonials with no buttons. You're not trying to take them anywhere. Okay. And do you send them via Calendarly or you use a totally different uh Yeah, we use Cali. Okay, makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I have looked at other tools, but we have so many integrations inside Calendarly. I have likeund and something zaps that are connected to which is a nightmare. But yeah, I've heard I closed is really really good for drop offs. really good because you get the the drop um because you basically get the application not built or whatever it is the other way around which is really nice. Um yeah, I like Cali personally. I think that a UI is the best. I hate HubSpot. I hate Acuy. I hate GHL. Um but they all work. It's like we talked about it yesterday as an example. Like you could have the ugliest sales page of all time that the buttons are broken and if you have the best offer and your and your address on the bottom like people will mail you to try and buy it, right? like think of it like that. But yeah, the cleaner the better. So the top top people use I I guess determines how you mean top but uh type form and calendarly are like the out of the box ones that most people use. Jeremy Haynes talks about that and embeds the calendarly inside the uh type form. Yeah. That's why he's like, "Oh, we have 100% uh app to booking ratio." And it's like, well, yeah, obviously they're inside one. Like I think it's so funny when he says that. Ours is like 60%. So, we'll have a 100 people that fill out an application. We'll have 60 people that book a call. And those 40 spread then live in a like app no book list that get emails that get dialed by uh setters that have all that nice. Final question, Ryan. When you boys when you guys had a tough period with ads, what did you feel like went wrong in recent like six 12 months? Um after like being educated necessarily, um what did you feel like went wrong with the ads and how did you fix it? Yeah. So, it was more so the acquisition system than it was the ads. Um, it was also the ads like how our entire ad account was structured was just like just we were just pressing it too hard. We were not diversified around things. You know, 70% of the spend was landing on similar creative because that was the one that won. Not to say we weren't testing other stuff because we were, but we were all we were hammering it all through one funnel and we did it too aggressively and over too short of an amount of time. So spending into the one we did with one VSSL funnel was not the move. So now where we're at right now, we have completely restructured the ad account. So like the entire structure of it and what we're optimizing for, purchase, schedule, different campaigns for that. And then the big thing is that VVS thing I talked about in the beginning where we have three different funnels. So they can come through and see different things and not just get hammered through one VSSL opt-in funnel and a ton of emails. They can enter through here direct app that has different messaging a little bit. They can enter through load ticket that has this. And we created more of like an ecosystem, not just one point of failure, which essentially is what happened. We had one ad account that was spending incorrectly and kind of structured wrong, but you couldn't turn it off because we need to keep calendars full. And then we had one funnel that you can only optimize so much that was getting a good cost per on stuff, but like we just hit it too hard. It's like it's not not to say it was fatigued, but like it was kind of fatigued for the for the pocket of audience that we're targeting. How do you differentiate in scaling to delegation versus self-learning? How do I differentiate delegation versus self-learning? As in like how do you identify what you want to pay to learn versus like what you hire from? Um yeah, when you're when you're scaling um that that has probably been a big error that was also the error of marketing was marketing was led by the other co-founder and me doing all the marketing tech and builds. So he was the mind behind it and like he even spent up until we were spending like 20k a day or more. Um when it he was writing the ads, he was doing that. Um so we needed to delegate that team out when we started to make more money earlier for longevity and scale and full like eyes and dedication on it. Um that was a big one that we didn't do um that we should have done earlier. So I don't know because I like to have I'm kind of under the belief personally of like understanding things well enough that you can delegate them. So getting your like expertise on a topic enough that like you know if an ad is good for example before you hire out someone to make your ads or like you know how the metrics or to run ads at x amount of scale to know if your media buyer is doing a good job or you know whatever how to coach in a good enough way to know that if your coach is coaching correctly right like at some level you need the experience or you need somebody who has the experience between you two. Um that's kind of our example of how we've done things with our you know chief of people chief of product like she was a coach then she led all the coaches and then she became chief product chief people. Um that's not something that like you can hire for though right? She like built the experience internal. Um I just last week hired a marketing tech for the first time. Like I have done all the marketing tech up until last week. So that is another example of like too late to the party but I can run circles around anybody in marketing tech. So, it's like I, you know, I just have him send me things now and I can approve them in two seconds because I know if I would do it like that or like that. So, that was uh that like we still pay for education non-stop. We pay to deploy things. We pay for education then have team deploy things. Um, right now I'm skipping our ops whatever meeting thing uh to be on here where they're going through basically a data restructure and tech and whatever and I'm having them record it and send it to me because like I still want my eyes on it and I don't want them to just full run it without me. So like I'm closer but like I still I still have eyes on that stuff. Okay. So you believe in to an extension of always self-educating and not just fully delegation without blind delegation to an extent. Yeah. Unless you can operate it in a way that like the person has experience in it already is a big difference between someone who's just like running it like almost all of our team has built experience through doing it in our team not coming with experience from external. It's a lot different if you hire someone that's you know our CSO for example has run 100 person sales teams. I have not run 100% sales team. So like my expertise is much lower than his. So there's a little bit more like hands off that can occur with someone like that versus like blind trust essentially in someone who comes in that's like I can run your sales team and they've had five sales reps under them and now they can run a team of 20. It's like you got to have eyes on it way more. Um my marketing tech just came from publishing.com built our exact tech stack and did 100 million a year through his systems. So, like I'm pretty I feel pretty good about him being able to, you know, structure my data, but I still am doing a checkpoint to make sure it like meshes with us because it's two weeks onboarding or whatever. Yeah, 100%. I don't want to take up any more of your time, Ryan. Um, yeah, it's been it's been a pleasure, but does anyone have any final questions before we wrap it up? I see one down here. The what percentage of your leads you convert to apps in the opt-in funnel and how many% of those apps come directly from the VSSL versus the mail flow? That's a little difficult to directly track. Um, I've run this gambit 90 times of trying to like direct solve for that. The percentage of here, let me just give you literal exacts because I don't want to give you a rough number. But like monthto date, for example, what's today? The 10th. So if I was to go today, the lead to app 30%. That's total, right? That's total total total blended. Now, that also introduces people that are direct that are whatever. But yeah, so we'll get, you know, let's call it 10,000 leads. We'll get 3,000 apps and we'll get 1,700 calls. Okay. So essentially around 15% of the leads get into calls. Okay. But that's benchmark as well, isn't it? Mhm. Approximately. Yeah. But our number forever has been oneish% of leads purchase which is terrible. Um but the math maths because of how we have so much consumption. So our we didn't really talk about this much, but our automations like hammer them. Like you want to talk about too many emails like we have opt we have opt no app. We have app no book. We have book not taken. We have no show cancel. So those are all contextual flows that are going to exist that are once a day emails that are value value in these directions. And then we have um twice a day emails that go out every single day, seven days a week for the last four years that go out to the whole list. Anybody anybody who's on the open hot list, which is hundred something thousand. So we're sending six million emails a month. That's crazy. Have you ever tried to six million emails a month? Yeah, I think it's Have you ever Have you ever tried to add the phone number and then dial the leads within five minutes to see how high you could get the percentage? Once once and uh the tradeoff was a 20some percent down um down in uh opt-in rate. So call it instead of getting you know 100, we were getting 80 and we weren't using the phone numbers to get the uptick. So it actually was a decrease overall. So because that's on us and our system was not built in a way. We tried to do it through AI. We built an entire in-house AI messaging platform that sends through send and like does all this stuff and we still use it to this day on app notebook but we don't use it on ops because it just has never converted for us well enough. Um we want them to take that action on their own um a little better. Now it is different with somebody who does like low ticket for example and doesn't book like we'll dial those right because they're hotter people but someone who just opted in for the training thus far we haven't built a system that makes sense to take the decrease in uh ops for the payoff of trying to get more apps through them like the math has never mathed and you managed to dial them within like I don't know what the speed to lead time on average was not correctly not correctly or 247 we have I mean because again to do that for us is like to flip it over. It's all of a sudden it's like, hey, now you have 800 phone numbers to call a day on top of all your other ones you have. And it's just like there's never been a time where we've been like, hey, let's just build a team and like test this for 14 days where we're just going to 800 new dials a day. Like even right now, we're talking about building out like a proper outbound team. We have 24 setters and they're barely managing the inflow before that. And they haven't even hit the 300,000 phone numbers in the CRM. like they're only hitting the ones that become app no books or low ticket not uh per not doing uh implementation calls or no show cancels or like if you look on our uh um our booking page we have like a no time works for you fill out this custom time request we'll have 15 of those a day that then setters claim the no like there's so many pockets the auto sets that come from low ticket our 15-minute zoom calls and fully pack their days like it's been a it's it's become a people thing more than anything that is like do you think AI AI upon is [ __ ] Yes. Mhm. You think it always will be or think it can evolve? No. No. No. No. I think we're six months away or whatever. I can't wait. I can't wait. I have an my AI textbot thing that we built that is custom is essentially like the Max AI. M AX.AI I think is the name of their company. We use them, but it was like five grand a month. We built it in-house for like hundreds of dollars a month. And it was sending through Alaware. And it would be like, "Hey, so we named her Mandy." Mandy Macros. It' be like, "Hey, so and so, this is Mandy." And it's after they get the application. So it consumes all it ingests all their application. It knows everything about us and then it's trying to push them to book a call. So it's like hey I see that you tried you know Jenny Craig in the past but this and this like what was your main holdback? Or it we have an entire database that scraped our whole site and it'll be like oh I see that you're 52 and have tried this and this. Here's a great resource on the site that I think you might like. And it'll link them dynamically to something on the site. And then they have conversation back and forth and then it's like I think you'd be a great fit. Click here to book. And that was 12% of our bookings. So you're talking likeund and something bookings a week, 150, 200 bookings a week for a long time and then setters like ate her cake because they're hitting the same app no book pool. But like if we could roll her out somewhere else, we tried her on email, didn't work. But we tried AI voice one time and we tried it on booking confirmations. So we were trying to make it so postbooking they would get dialed and get their like, hey, you know, this is a Zoom call, you know, it's central time zone, you know, whatever. And it would do that. Um, but it didn't work for us because the AI couldn't handle all the contextual questions. Didn't sound real enough. Like, it'll be there, though. It'll 100% be there. Like, I've I've listened to other people's, but they're always like simpler. They're always, you know, a reservation or order food to go or whatever, and like those work because they can like look up a database, look back. Um, but for us, the the context just didn't make sense. And maybe we built it wrong, but we used like a Y Combinator company that was XYZ, and they built it out and they still couldn't get it to work. So sick. Well, you know what? One last question. Yeah. Um, fellow American here. How you doing, Ryan? How are we doing? Doing great. Um, love the love everything that you shared so far today. Um, I run a B2B cold email agency for service based businesses in the US and I have like so many um, ideas. I I guess just hearing your system of sales, all the funnels um that you're running right now, I want to start tackling them through. And of course, you want to do everything all at once, but I'm guessing aside from my one main funnel of cold email, and we get fantastic referrals consistently from our clients, too. Um, what would be one that you would I guess look forward to run first if you wouldn't start with like a combination of them? DTAunnel. So I would do so we did we did this in the past where we ran a DTA funnel style for the insurance thing and we did it through LinkedIn messaging. So the initial iteration of that was him he was an architect that then turned life insurance agent. So we modeled the entire thing around that. So it's called cash flow architects. It was here's how you do your XYZ. I don't even know how you say it. It's like some ex something session that's like an architecture word. The entire VSSL was all about architecture. Like it was this whole thing. And then we went on LinkedIn. We just targeted architects. Changed his profile to be all about how he was a past architect turned life insurance rep. And then we just cold cold automated DM'd on LinkedIn and pushed people to the VSSL. It's all we did. It was like, "Hey, do you get a chance to check out the training?" Like start a conversation, push them to a DTA funnel, which was a headline, a VSSL, and apply button. And we got so many applications. the percentage throughput was disgusting. And then we realized that architects are broke and they don't fit the demo for what he's trying to sell as the product because he only had one product to sell them, which was this insurance thing. And we didn't do it the right way where we could have sold some architecture info product thing for life insurance and then had some long game. But we just picked the wrong niche. But the process worked phenomenally. Phenomenally. Okay. The DTA funnel is the easiest if you have traffic that's in a way that like at some level is already interested or is niche specific or whatever. It's literally a headline, a VSSL, and an applicationbooking. It's all it is. Two pages, three pages money. Okay. And I want to roll in uh low ticket like I have I have one that I'm building right now something that's like uh we just got someone a recurring uh contract for over 100,000 a year and I was going to say like three line email for 100 thou like used to generate $100,000 recurring work. Um where would you use that? Would you go like an ad directly to sign up? Yeah. So, you're going to sell the script. Yeah. Like Yeah. Yeah. So, it just be Yeah. Just be a long form page and then Yeah. Either add whatever source. I mean, it could be I mean, [ __ ] you could do cold email. I mean, you can do whatever traffic source. You can do ads, you can do organic, you can do whatever. And then either sell it for seven bucks or give it away or whatever. and then just have a simple page with some sales copy down it, some examples, some case studies. Look at uh Automatic Clients. They're the best at selling the low ticket stuff. Automatic clients.com is uh all sultanic and he is like all about that. Perfect. And he has templates and all that kind of stuff. And his course is 27 bucks or something and then it does the classic upsell trump thing until it's 35k whatever. But he g he gives away all of his stuff for free inside uh the Facebook group. So, he has a ton of stuff on that. But, yeah, the plug-and-play systems are the best things that you can sell for seven bucks, 27 bucks, whatever. That's here's my plug-and-play threeline email that landed me $100,000 client. And then you can either do a quick little VSSL thing and then an application, or you can direct sell it. You could use that exact example for any type of these acquisition methods, sold or application or whatever, dude. Incredible. Thank you so much. So, we'll wrap it up there, Ryan. We really really appreciate your time and you know um all these guys are between I think Tamir you're still 16 or what? Uh 17 two months. 17 two months. So being 16 and um I think the oldest me have here is maybe grandad Noah I don't know maybe Mike I don't know 26. Um, I don't know. But yeah, young group of guys and I know you're young yourself as well, but uh we really really appreciate hopping on because the world that we live in uh day in day out is full of like phonies to be honest. Um, you know, you just talk [ __ ] and flex uh a certain perception rather than actually knowing what they're talking about. And it's really a breath of fresh air to have someone come on who actually knows what the [ __ ] they're talking about. And it's uh it's very very clear to see. And so we appreciate that. that allows all of our guys to think bigger and um to realize like we actually know football [ __ ] all compared to what we shouldn't need to know. H so we really appreciate you hopping on brother and we wish you the the best of luck with everything you're doing with the YouTube and the the content, the branding and everything you're doing for yourself as well. And um yeah, enjoy it, bro. I really appreciate it. Yeah, I appreciate you guys reaching out. These are uh these are fun. I'm old in the game now. I'm 28 and I started in this when I was probably 19. I bought my first course thing and then started with Warrior Babe and building pages and learning this when I was 22 probably and [ __ ] off for a lot of years, right? Honestly, like we made some cash and then just kind of just thought it was cash flow and was doing a million million things and it's only been over the last year or so 27 28 that we took this thing like really seriously and tried to scale into it. So yeah, you guys all start in this age and all the people I'm meeting on X and YouTube and whatever are all young guns, 20s, even third, whatever that are or teens that are just cooking. So it's great to see. It's just what you just said, like there's a lot of fluff and [ __ ] and scammy and short-term thinking that a lot of these people have that I think communities like this uh help avoid that. So I appreciate you guys. you had like if you had a few sentences to say to that younger version of yourself you were just talking about what would they be? Oh man. Uh I someone asked me this on one of these on the Q&A and it was like in two words or whatever and I was like sit the [ __ ] down and shut up I think was what I said. Uh but I just like stand by that like dude I had such an ego like I started making a couple hundred grand like a month probably at that range and like it was and and by and all to say that was like this that was like in waves. It wasn't like, "Oh, cool. Now I make a couple hundred grand a month and it stays like that." It was like some winds and then it was like some troughs and then it was some winds and it was like, "I'm partying. I'm doing this. I'm that. I'm living over here. I'm trying to like figure out tax zones." And it's like don't even make like just so classic like like exactly what you see not to do. I had heard not to do it and I still did it. And don't take your sales person that's the best and make him the manager. I'd heard not to do it and we did it. It's like read every book on this shelf. And I just couldn't learn until I did it myself. And so yeah, so I had huge I had a huge ego. Um I would say stop that at the door. I don't care who you are. People respect the opposite of the flashy [ __ ] Um I don't like it on social really either. Like I like through and through just like as transparent as real as a human as you can be and sticking to that uh case studies and results and stuff like you can be proud of that by not being a douche. You can be proud of your numbers. You can say, "Oh, we did 75 million and I have friends that do five times that." And like it's not for ego, right? It's like just to like have some authority. Yes. By not being a douche though and being like, "Check out my 75 and like this and this and no one can beat us and like it's just it's just a shortterm game." So thing I would say to myself is shut up and sit down and keep working and think long term because I definitely thought very short term back then and longterm does not necessarily mean hormone 10ear stuff like he probably know he knows a lot better than I do. Um, but you don't have to think necessarily in 10 year windows. You can think in one and three year windows and still act a lot differently than if you're thinking in month windows. That that's great. I appreciate it, Ryan. Um, cool, guys. Yeah. In a bit. Thanks very much, Ryan. Best of luck. Thanks for coming. Talk soon.

# Avoid Shiny Object Syndrome By "Stacking" Businesses | EP88
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZISk534Mamc

In today's video, we're going to be talking about avoiding shiny object syndrome by stacking. All of us get shiny object syndrome, whether we see lead genen, ecom, info coaching, personal brand, whatever, and think that it is a better, faster, more fun, whatever way to make money online. And I'm telling you right now, the grass is always greener where you water it. Okay? Sounds cliche, but we're going to break it down today. Go through a couple different niches, and then how you could stack these business models on top of each other through acquisition models, monetization models, and fulfillment models. All right, this is going to be a fun one. Good thought exercise and yeah, go through some real life examples. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done over 76 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. All right, so let's get into it. This is going to be a fun one just because this is exactly what's on my brain right now. So avoiding shiny objects. These are just some common ones and even another one that was on here that I didn't throw. We're going to build this board live today which we usually don't do. So software. So a lot of people talk info coaching pros and cons. We're going to quick go through. So info coaching people see as a quick win. They see it as quick cash. They see it as easy to fill and deliver. And they are kind of correct. Okay. Um it is generally speaking a pretty high margin business especially if you are the one doing the info or coaching or if you're just giving a login access. Uh it's really just your marketing expense. Right. So, in your acquisition, if you're doing direct to cart, you are doing marketing direct to something and then giving them monetization is generally either one-time access if it's info or recurring model if there's some sort of coaching or continuation. And fulfillment is going to be a login access and some group coaching calls. As it gets more uh intense or depending on the model, you can have onetoone coaches, you can have group coaches, you can have all those things, but this generally speaking is a pretty high margin biz. physical ecom. People see the exit value. People see the just run an ad, make the like there's there's a lot of ways that people look at this, but depending if you're doing drop shipping, branded drop shipping, branded normal full inventory, whatever, it just has a sexier appeal for like a real business and real growth. You have recurring customers depending you play the MR game and you have recurring, if you have consumables or something, people come back to purchase. Um, but this has always been very attractive to me. Um, especially when they're kind of more faceless. Buy, sell, private equity. This is like the hot thing right now. You could also call it like hold co. Uh I'm going to get into this one a lot later, but this is like the tunch above that everyone wants to get to and they want to own multiple of these businesses and these business models and that's how they scratch the itch. Lead gen affiliate cash in cash out is a simple way everyone looks at it. You run $100,000 a day in ads, you make 120 grand back, you clear 20 and that's that. This goes so much deeper and that is such an over uh simplification of the business model because there are data plays, there is entire team plays. These have exit ability as well, especially on the lead genen side. I love this. Every 3 days, I want to go start one of these. Um, but that's what we're going to talk about here. Stacking these so you don't get shiny object syndrome. Software, very sexy thing for a lot of people. Uh, whether it's bolted on the back, it's a standalone thing. Real estate. This is kind of a side tangent, but this is more of the what I mean by this is more so of actually kind of doing it active but doing it more so for taxation investing that piece and then personal brand is the hot topic right so everyone's talking about doing personal brands everyone's talking about growing in that way and generally then doing it for info coaching so they want the fame they want the clout they then want to charge people for info coaching generally on top of one of these business models um all right So let's go through some examples. I'm going to use women's fitness on this because it's our exact example and how I'm looking at stacking these. So for us, women's fitness and let's walk through this right now. For us, acquisition models, let's start from the back. So fulfillment model for us is currently one-to-one coaching, but it is done through not us being the coach uh through someone else. So there's hard cost to that uh of having a team to do so. The monetization model is annual coaching. So there are we technically do have some info in here um that is one time but majority of it is going to be annualized coaching and then acquisition models for us is 99% paid and they're going through three different types of funnels and I have a ton of videos on the channel talking about that. Okay. Now, sitting in this knowing that we sell info coaching. Okay. I want to do all of these. I want to go I want a software. I want personal brand. I want lead genen affiliate. Like I want all of these. But it is shiny shiny. And it they don't make sense to put inside the same thing except a couple of them. Okay? And that's what I'm talking about here when I say stacking. So for us, I want to do physical ecom. I'm going to bring physical ecom into this business. So let's move this actually over here. So I want to stack these models in this way. So we can continue to have info coaching but then we can also have physical ecom that exists let's say to start on the back to existing customers but then gets becomes full force where it is front end and you can sell things direct but I want these to feed each other and live within the same as a multiplier effect not as a distraction where now all of a sudden I have this xyz ex e-commerce company that's for dogs. Okay, cuz now I'm running this business and I'm running this business and then also I want to do life insurance, lead gen and like all these other things and I have a fear that I will then fail at all of them. Okay, so in current state for me, let's move these back. This is the plan. We're going to do this. We're going to stack this. There is a potential play to do this, but that is much different beast as well. A whole dedicated team, the proper whatever, and maybe even should be standalone. Okay, so these are the three we're stacking right here. And then through these same acquisition, monetization and fulfillment models, there may be some differences for fulfillment where we do group. There may be differences for info where it is login access and even mid ticket physical ecom. This can exist either on the front end or the back end. Okay, so kind of doesn't really fit in this model, but uh the front end or the back end, meaning that we are sending ads direct to it because it's a hero product that can do that. And then software generally speaking unless it's B2B is going to exist on the back in some capacity and really not be a software that's like standalone in at all. Okay. So this is more so we would build software internal but not scale it up that it's like a standalone company in current state. Okay. Now let's go through some of these other ones. Dogs and let's take them to the nth degree. So let's put our women's fitness back. Let's put our info. We'll leave these over here. So next one. Let's say dogs. I know people that do millions of dollars a month in dog training that do it in dog that do physical businesses of draw dog in person training right so you can take this one to the nth degree and the skills that you learn through the online business piece whether that is and which is mainly around the acquisition it can kind of be around these two but like it's mainly around this because it's going to be your p paid advertising your organic your conversion cycle of whether you're doing what type of offer or phone sales or whatever I'm kind of bucketing that all into acquisition models but a Very clean example of this is info that is you know dog training or is dog XYZ. Okay. Now with that you have oops let me just move this over here. You have the exact same play and the playbook that you can run. Okay. Let's remove software from here but let's go like this. Okay. So you have info coaching. This can already do millions of dollars a month just as is. Okay. Whether that is literally in person or completely remote both work. And then physical e-commerce. I know guys who do multiple multiple millions a month by selling physical e-commerce like the dog sauce guys or whatever that company's called. Um supplements like in that game uh physical toys and products like whether that's branded drop ship or your own full-on situation like you can take any of these to the nth degree. Going further beyond that there is real estate plays, there are private equity plays, there are lead genen plays. So real estate I know people who own dog physical kennels and situations like that. not the same people that do this, which is interesting. Um, but you can take that to the nth degree. Leadgen, I know guys who do literally there are affiliate networks that have uh dog food, dog, whatever processing things you can do lead genen. So, all of where I'm going with this is basically saying taking one of these niches to the nth degree instead of trying to have a dog food business over here on the side and this and this. And there are people who crush it at this. So, this is not like a, you know, they are more so uh exemption or whatever. there there are kind of like unicorns out here that do that well. You know, you got your Elon Musk of the world, but like where can you overlap and stack the skill set and the business models on top of each other within a specific niche? Okay, so let's take vegan food. Same thing here. Uh my mom has a blog that's a vegan blog and how could you take it further? So that doesn't really exist in info coaching. It's more of a display and whatever. So it's kind of actually more a little bit lead genen affiliate but like super low scale. Um it's display ads, right, is what it does. But on top of that, the next business model that she would easily be able to do is to sell info. So cookbooks, um, education classes on, you know, 10day vegan quick start, whatever. Like they have ClickBank products around this. Coaching is the next tier up that could be mid-t that would be teaching how to do XYZ within the vegan food niche. There are software plays that I know that people have vegan software that have softwares that are around vegan meal planning and can stack those on top of each other. The personal brand exists basically on top of this. So this is her big play where she has this and then could go into any of these verticals. Physical ecom she can then take that and have and again this is not a business model I'm trying to pursue so FYI but um physical e-commerce where I know people who have made like this sounds crazy but they have like tofu presses and stuff that do hundreds of thousands of dollars a month that to my understanding have zero paid advertising have nothing and literally just exist okay and they have little patented things and whatever. So like there is the depth you can take this real estate. This is going like mogul status and I'm not going to go there but that lead genen affiliate you can easily layer on and then buy sell private equity. Now with this one and I haven't really talked about this one much through these models but there are plays that people have holding companies that are all health food oriented that are all businesses that are in whatever natural XYZ niche and it would not be far stretched for someone to have a vegan hold co that or private equity co that only does that. Now, let's get into some like actuals on like what my play is here and stop talking about some of these examples. So, if you go into here and say where we're currently at or what where I exist in this. Okay, so my play right now is essentially I'm doing this personal brand thing. Then I have this women's fitness thing where I'm trying to stack these. Okay, so I hate moving these while I'm talking to you guys. This is like difficult. All right, so this is kind of the play book we're running right now. I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this. But I'm not going to. The only thing and how I'm starting to navigate is I'm going to attempt to stack these on top of each other with this. Okay. So, kind of look at these like tiers. So, within the women's fitness, we're going to do info coaching. And this alone can be scaled to 10 million a month. I know people who have done 10 million a month just in this gambit, right? Not that big of a deal. So, info coaching layer in physical e-commerce as a why wouldn't you land grab whether that's through partnership or on your own. Whether this chooses to stand alone on itself on front end or not is different. Okay, so that's one playbook. Now there's me as an individual. I'm sitting essentially like this. Okay, so this is what I do here. And instead of being like, oh, let's go start this lead genen business on the side and do this where the skills that are overlapping and stacking are basically just the paid advertising side. Okay? And like we already have team for that, we already have that. It just sounds like a fun thing to me to do and I'm just holding off on doing it. Uh unless I'd had proper partners and doing that. So, what I'm thinking more so is leaning more in this land, which is so cliche and what everyone is talking about doing, but I have a theory on how to do it in a more strategic way for this info coaching land. So, a lot of people what they're going to do is they're going to go up and they're going to build this whole business model and they're going to go over here in this private equity bucket and be like, "Oh, now I'm also going to do this in I'm going to have a lead genen company and I'm gonna have a software company. I'm gonna have I'm gonna have a bunch of real estate. I'm going to do it across uh landscaping and life insurance and dogs and women's fitness." And then like that is not my play. I'm trying to stay navigated between a specific niche and a specific type of industry. Okay. So, if all I know 99% of what I know is within this industry, I want to learn this and I'm going to do it within this vehicle. Okay. Now, the other piece is what I'm building on top of here, which is me as an individual and the n and as I navigate throughout this, I'm not going to pinch myself just in this specific industry and I did not do that off this from the start because I am more so on this. Okay. Okay, so my personal brand exists within this space. Now, instead of going, "Oh, cool. I'm going to go start this physical e-commerce company that does dog food or do this lead genen affiliate thing that does insurance." My theory and where I'm trying to skill stack on top of each other is going to be keeping the personal brand highlighted in the info coaching space, but changing out the fulfillment model and the monetization model of this. So, how do I do this? and where do I live in this land where I can monetize this without equity play and fulfill this by not having 92 meetings a week where I have you know I'm sitting in sea levels or whatever or above sea level whatever you want to look at of all these different companies instead the fulfillment model being something and I'll I'll get into this later more when I get into when I actually start to build some of this out but info coaching buy sell private equity style but not as much on the sell okay so I'm thinking of this in kind of a different way. And I'll get into this on other videos, but that's kind of how my arc is looking right now. Now, let's use some more examples on here and then I'll shut up because this is just kind of like a circular video. Life insurance. All of you ask me all of the time, how would I start this today? What niche would I go into? Whatever. Let's use life insurance as a great example here and break down all of these. So, life insurance, I know people who have done info coaching in life insurance, have sold an entire thing for call it 5 or 10K. I forget the exact price point. So it might have been cheaper. They were doing direct to cart where they sold info coaching and did that right here. Okay. It was I think a 2K product, maybe 5K, I don't know. I don't remember. Um but once they were inside there, all of the product itself was talking about using XYZ system and that system was life insurance. Now the guys who were selling this info coaching were also licensed life insurance reps and then provided life insurance for all these guys in whole life and IL whatever they were using and made commissions on that. So, let's say they made a three to 5x rorowaz on the front. Let's say they broke even on the front. Who cares? The amount of money they were making then on commissions on the back end from this piece was massive. They also went the next layer to then say you're going to use it through real estate. So, they had other vehicles they made money in like funds, like flips, like pre- ready flips, like all these other things. So, they made money on info coaching. They made money on life insurance itself, not just as an industry, but as an actual product and skew. Then they also used multiple vehicles in real estate and they stacked these all into each other and just made a massive multiplier because there is somebody out there who will sell the same program for 2k or 5k and is going to make their 2 to 3x on rorowaz and that is it. And their back end might be some mastermind or something where they just talk about this stuff more high level. These guys had multiple ways to monetize as well as fulfill that made them 5 10 30x on the back end. Okay, so that was the beauty of that one. Now that is what I would do today. So I would do life insurance in some capacity likely uh as an example or something in the financial industry uh services. There's a lead genen play where you can do paper call, you can do forms, you can do whatever. So there's an easy not I want to say easy, easy is the wrong word. There's a simple framework and playbook that people run this in lead genen and affiliate. I know another guy that went the next layer and built a software that's not necessarily a standalone software but more a marketplace for the lead flow that he buys in lead genen and affiliate. You can then have info, coaching, real estate. This is we're just going to remove real estate because that's where it's going to get confusing. Um, and then runs them through here and then also has their personal brand tied into here. Okay. They don't really do any private equity plays. They don't really do any physical e-commerce plays. But all to say, they're loading these on top of each other to make it so they already got an offer for this to to exit this business. Um, just by doing the lead genen piece, the software piece, personal brand exists kind of outside of it. It is not the actual flow of it, but they talk about it as a personal brand and then they have info coaching that's kind of on top of it teaching this model. But this piece of the model was already offered to be acquired. Uh somebody already sent them an offer. So, a lot of ways to cut the cake. Uh a lot of ways to look at this. I feel like I'm being a bit confusing here, but I kind of don't care. Um this is just what I'm thinking about right now and how I'm trying to avoid shiny object syndrome by stacking these on top of each other. So, this is my example over here right now. This and this are the two core things I'm doing with the idea of doing this, this and this, right? And still never selling anything. Okay? Because I don't want to sell anything and I don't want to have that on the conscious of now I have to go help all these people who I've accepted money from. So that's the plan. Uh some of these other videos I'm going to go into some more stuff that's happening with us here because we're doing some crazy stuff and scaling really aggressively. Um, but right now it's just more interviews, more conversations around that. Today is day 87 in a row of us doing this. Um, I do want to talk about this one. Sorry, this video is all over the place. Uh, so this one I know somebody who is doing this right now and it's actually a different sport. So I'm not going to dox them because they are crushing and I don't want them to I like their business too much. So they are doing some different sport. Let's say it's for goalies for soccer. Okay. So they are teaching info coaching. They're the best and the best in the world. They have remote and they also have in-person. They're not necessarily making money on the real estate, but they have physical locations. They have a personal brand on top of it that runs it like an info coaching business or like a true expertled info coaching business, but it is branded. Um, so they have people that are communicating there. They do I think it's close to a million bucks a month right now through organic. They have a software that's basically an app. So it's not again a standalone software. It's just part of the fulfillment model and delivery. They don't do anything on lead genen affiliate. They do have some physical ecom and that is that. So the big play for them though is this model right here just selling off this. This is small. This is just piece of the puzzle and this is piece of the puzzle. But because of the niche that they're in, they have so much opportunity on the back end and it's almost all organic. So they have great margins because they don't do paid right now. But they have so much to squeeze within this that already exists. And then even more things on the backend fulfillment such as I don't want I don't want to give away their sauce, but there's big big big big like multi-million dollar backend plays um that works off of a niche like this. And yeah, so I don't want to give away too much of their stuff, but all I'm saying is whether it's these or whether you layer in a couple other online business things that people do, there are a lot of ways to cut one niche and break it down and make money from multiple things that excite you and that are fun all within the same instead of having to spin up a bunch of different businesses in different niches or different sides and then have them all be subpar. Okay, this was confusing. I'm sure it was even confusing for me. So, apologies for that. But let me know if you guys have any thoughts around this or some other ways you look at this. Uh, this is a constant thought process I'm having. And, uh, I think this is going to be my game plan for sure. Um, this is going to be my game plan. So, that's current state. We'll see. Things change quickly, but I will talk to you guys soon. Uh, all the videos are here. Like I said, today's day 87, I believe, in a row. I'm running this up to 100 and then we'll see. Um, but yeah, you guys can go here and see all the videos, find stuff that is specific to you, tech, sales, marketing, ops, all the things. And let me know if you have any questions. Uh, Instagram's the best. X is also good. and I'll talk to you guys soon.

Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people, building cool All right, so let's get into it. First question, beginner marketer funnel. I have no idea what you mean by this. Um, there's a lot of beginner marketing funnels. Uh, in info and coaching, it is extremely common for someone to do a DTA funnel as the first one. So, direct to app. Other people call it a direct to VSSL. You can watch other videos on the channel where I talk about this. But the simplest simplest is probably something that's to book a phone call. I would say maybe an opt-in funnel where it's just like a free lead magnet, but not like a full-fledged. Uh, if you're thinking beginner, I don't really understand the question, so I think you should probably answer it or ask it a little differently. Um, but yeah, I'm going to move to the next one. Uh, I'm a co-owner for an info product company. Nice. Same. Uh, we run a Tik Tok and Instagram to DM a book a call funnel. Our main bottlenecks are unqualified bookings. Everyone's saying they have less than 500 to invest. How would you change the content messaging? So, we target higher qualified leads and would you say you shorten the amount of DMs to book as many as call possible and put the qualifying questions in the Cly page itself? What's the best way to make sure leads are qualified and show up? All right, couple things here. One, so it's consumption/qualification. So first things first, instead of pushing them all to a phone call, you can push them somewhere else that you capture their info. So you can push them to get them to qualify themselves more. So you can run them into uh you can either get them to opt in for something uh you can qualify them there. Like if you look at an example like when HubSpot gives away something or uh does like a qualification, they will uh for like a lead magnet, they'll have qualifying questions in the opt-in. So that's one way. You already kind of said that here on the book a call. So yeah, you want to make sure that you are qualifying them before a call. You don't want to waste bandwidth of a sales rep or whoever pre doing that. So whether that's in an application, whether that's in a calendarly page or in the booking, whether that is in the opt-in itself, whether that's in the messaging you do inside this portion. So you can shorten the amount of DMs. You can qualify them in the DM, like in DM before you push them to a call. So I think you're already answering your own question. Um, right here, this is generally like pretty top of funnel and broad. The other bigger thing is like clearly how you what you're talking about up here is bringing those people in. So like the very very top of this is what content you're actually producing. And if that content is bringing in the $500 people and you have nothing to sell them or that's not your target person, like you can change the content itself and it'll, you know, go upstream. So if you change that first, that'll trickle down. But then yeah, the middle layer stuff is definitely necessary. So either qualifying them through DM, uh qualifying them on an application, sending them somewhere that is instead of direct to a call, you can have something lower ticket you can sell them that maybe that they can then ascend. Um you can sell or you can just give something free and try and qualify them as well. um build community. Like a lot of people for example will use a lot of these like top offunnel content and push them into a free community um school whatever they'll push them into there and then to send them from there. People do them to an opt-in to give them some free like everything from a free training which is a VSSL generally um to free courses stuff like that. So you get them in, they get more consumption, and then even though if they have less than 500, which they can blatantly lie to you, by the way, um if they have less, you still need the consumption before they're ready to buy something that's 2K, 5K, 10K, 30K, right? Like generally speaking. So, and then once, yeah, I mean, this kind of answers that once you know they're qualified is a little different than showed up. Um because showing up is you need a reason for them to show up and you need the proper reminders and stuff. But solve for the first one and then uh DM me about this because I'm happy to help. How do you get done? Um, too many hours, not enough focus. I'm terrible at this 100%. So, definitely need to work on this. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I just work a lot, but I work kind of haphazardly and scattered right now. And that is something I need to work on. Uh, what's the best way to grow to 20K per month as an agency? Also, should spend some money or stay locked in until 50K. Um, definitely stay locked in until beyond 50K. I'm going to tell you that. Um, but what's the way to grow to 20K per month as an agency? I've never run an agency, so I don't have a good answer for you here directly. Um, I personally like higher ticket. So, I would have a couple performance deals that can get me there. You could have one deal that gets you there pretty easily in my opinion. Um, but if you're just trying to do like small service and do the volume game, you know, 10 at 2K is really not that big of a deal. Um, you just have to come up I don't I don't know your offer is. I don't know how much your offer is or what you're selling. For example, I know a lot of people are doing and I talk about it on here a lot is the AI agency stuff. A lot of people are doing that. Uh which again is more so selling the result and then making it sexy as the mechanism using AI. So basically you sell whatever automated thing uh or whatever the result is of said automated thing and then you do it through AI and it's like a sexy way to sell it. So people do it for uh lead generation, people do it for efficiencies within the business. But something that you can quantify is, you know, you're making them 100k in value and you're just going to charge 20 G's. And that can be across, you know, multiple clients. So it could be you're making them 10 grand, you're charging them two grand or whatever. So yeah, that's what I would focus on. Um, but I need some more context here on what you're trying to do. And there's a million people who talk about this on YouTube who do really well and find somebody who actually runs an agency and then listen to them. Can you talk about in-depth on how to retain clients? It's not talked about enough. how often you should check in, onboarding, etc. Yeah. So, again, also probably not the best person for this, but um what is Dan Martell has a book um that's all about software, but you can use that book. It's I think it's uh software as a ser no not software as a service that would be too easy. Um it's like it's something like that. It's like software service something along those lines. Um but it's a really good book that talks about this which is all about in software you know it's a math problem essentially is what he breaks down but that churn is a huge piece of that and how to do things in onboarding activation client touch points um so you can use that for service not and and group coaching and one-on-one coaching but yeah it's extremely important to have proper onboarding extremely important to have a proper check-ins it's extremely important to have all that kind of stuff like when they're at their peak point you know sign resign them like all those things um so Again, probably not the best person here, but for ours, for example, just to give you a little bit more context, um, our stuff is going to have essentially daily communication onetoone. It's going to have monthly that's going to have a ton of touch points that happen all month. And then more so what it is is like that transitionary period for the next uh for like the renewal essentially uh is at the peak points and then towards the end as like a final bucket to scoop them into um or like have them land in if they didn't get it throughout the middle. So, not really answering it, but again, same as this answer, go to somebody who does agency specific because I'm sure there's some way that's like specific around how you do wins and when you guys have big successes talking about increasing XYZ service or going further or whatever. But I also know and I have heard that, you know, you get them the results and the next thing they do is they want more results or the changes that happen because now they want to go this other direction. Like I've heard that happens a lot in agency and I don't know cuz I don't run an agency. Um, if you had to begin from zero and had no network, I've had no network up until 90 days ago. Uh, how would you do things differently to get to the point where you're at today? No back-end product or teams behind only selfquidating offer funnels. Oh jeez. What products, markets, upsells? Um, I would do something. I don't know. I don't know if you're asking if you're telling me that I can have no back-end product or teams and it's strictly direct response selfquidating offers. Uh, that's also kind of not my game. So there's direct response guys that crush this. Um they do it with ecom, they do it with info, they do it with a lot of things. Um communities, MR. So I like backend stuff. I like actual scaled like business, not just like one-time offer. Um I do know that something that mid if you can land on something mid-t you have a little bit more room. But there are guys who do 50k a day all day every day either as an affiliate or I know a guy that does it with his own offer that he owns that's front- end profitable with low ticket. So, and they're in the how do I not they're in the health space. Um so they do something in there. I know guys who do it with supplements all the time. Um I know affiliates that do it. So I don't know. I mean for me I would do backend and I would do team. So I would do something that has higher ticket. I would do something that has legs that has commissions. And so I've used this example a lot, but like insurance for example or like financial management, taxation, that kind of stuff. You can sell them on info or low ticket or middle. That's either break even or lose a little bit money or I guess you could do it if you stack the right stuff with upsells. You could do it profitably. Um but you make all the money on the back like all the big big money because you get percents of whatever deal size or value or transaction like you make more money on the back and that's what a lot of businesses are. I don't really do a lot of stuff that's like, you know, make 20% on the front end day on day and then just like that's all you do. So, how to scale a pre-existing info product that another info agency made without starting again from scratch. How to scale a pre-existing info. I'm going to need a lot more information than that. Um, because you're going to have to build it around how to scale a pre-existing info product that has another info agent that another info agency made. I mean, if it already exists, you just scale it. So, find what's broken. Find the spot of where it's pinched currently, or is the cost per booking too high? Is the cost per sale too high? Is the cost per sale too high on a on a low ticket because of the ad creative and the cost per click and the whatever or because the conversion on page or is the offer just bad? Is the fulfillment not get the ascension? Is the fulfillment not built in a way to have as like I have no idea. Do you have a back-end program? Do you not? So, I don't have enough context to give you accurate. Make a video about what you do in your personal life to make your work life easier, such as chef, meal prep, any automations for your personal email, contacts, routines, no electronics, go in depth. Okay. Um, I can do this. Um, but I do terrible at this. So, I'm just going to give you a brief thing like try and get up early. Um, for a while it was 4:00 or 5 in the morning. Lately, it's like 6:00 7. Um, I did do meal prep for a long time, but now I just eat ground beef or freaking cold cuts basically. Uh, I'm on this computer all day and I don't need to be because I don't have that much work, but I'm scattered. I do not have an EA yet. So, I am scheduling all these interviews and doing all these videos and all this pre- stuff and post stuff myself uh and running the business. So, I'm not doing this well. I know all the right things you're supposed to do and I don't do them. I do not turn off my phone at a certain time. I do not stop answering things at a certain time. I do not get rid of electronics at a certain time and I do not sleep a certain amount of time. Um, I am an example of the worst model of this in current state. I wake up, I get coffee, I get water, and I sit down at this desk. So, that's the gist, but maybe once I dial this in, I'll make a video about it. Hey, Ryan, I think I'm making a survey of sorts to gather what time prospects would prefer to book their call if a calendar was empty. Collect data and see if there's a trend on what time would be and sort the factor into sales rep's calendars. Lowish prospects, we're going to try and give you save you guys the gist here. Contacts, we use a grading system that app inputs one to three. Okay, so they rate their bookings. Good. The level four books, what available calendar and shows the preferred two days. We look for level twos to replace, but example is this. Sorry, I'm just trying to rip through this. If high quality prospects show a trend wanting to book two days out, then create a content barrage system. Obviously, they would want I don't think this is a high point of return to business, but I do want to get your thoughts. Mainly because this is fun. Yeah, it is fun. Um, I wouldn't optimize around this at all. I would not try and backfill and game the system because you're going to have outliers every single time and it is there is technically yes you can find this we've done this and found you know what window or 4hour window or two-hour window is the hottest point and have coverage on that but the real answer is just have coverage so what we've tested in our market which is B toc is a 48 hour booking window leave it as that you go beyond that and you start to get show rates that fall through the floor setters try and book same day if they can't fill same day they go one day more, they go one day out, then they go two days out. And the setters actually are allowed to go three days out because they have the touch point of communication, not just automations for show rates. Um, so they're allowed to go beyond the booking widget, which also makes it so that the marketing booking widget stays at 48 on purpose and then the setter one goes out 72, but they try and push them as soon as soon as possible. So, hammer them strat, yes, it works dynamically, so you don't need to worry about that. Um, I mean, you're right, like you're they're going to get less content if it's a shorter amount of time, but if someone's trying to book like soon, you want them to be able to book soon. So, the real answer is get the coverage. Yes, this grading system, we actually don't we kind of do this, but we only do it in two buckets right now. Um, because we have the availability, right? We can book hundreds of calls a day with the calendars we have and we're actually pushing for more availability from current team and current state. Um, but yeah, that's that's what I would do um more so. And then yes, rank them and yes, put the top ones with the top closers. And yes, have this visible to at least the decision-making people on the team. Maybe not the reps because sometimes I'm torn on this because sometimes if you give them too much information or they think that it's an unqualified whatever person it somebody who's unqualified because of what they filled out on something is not necessarily unqualified and that is not like source of truth and like live by that because ours have historically showed to back out less too but they still close. We've also run like API tools against them of what they've said versus what they actually have financially or whatever with things like leadfy and whatever and they actually come back that they have more money sometimes than some of these other people. So, it really depends on how someone fills out your application, which is kind of hard for this, but yeah, that's what I would do. Can you please talk about organic versus paid ads for marketing? Like pros and cons of both. Yeah. Um I know so many more people now that do organic than paid um that I've met online and like through this and they crush. So the reason you can have margins you can have so like simple math is if you just sell something on the front end which is not super realistic but like let's say you do and you have a 3x return like quick simple math let's call it 30% uh immediately is burned on your P&L because you're using paid ads versus these guys that can do 70 80 90% like I had uh William Brown on here and he was talking about how they did 83% margin last uh or currently at like five or six hundred grand a month and that's because he has him and two people basically on fulfillment moment and all the uh all the traffic is organic. So he has no paid ads and he has the leanest team you could possibly think of and that's his only like you know his couple simple softwares and that's about it. So crazy. Um for us paid ads is it's the consistency around it as well. So we are booking calendar spots. We want the consistency and then we can't generate it through organic. We've never leaned in or with organic and we're doing this now enough to where it generates there. Right now, organic is like 1% of our first click. Everything is paid. And then our organic exists as our content more so exists as middle and bottom of funnel more so than it does uh as first click. So, we're working on that actually right now to build that out more. Um because I see a huge lever here and this is like brand. This is all that. And we produce a ton of content. It just doesn't really exist as you know initial source. So, I like organic. I think everyone should build it. I think they should build it over time and it compounds on itself. It's a whole brand game, but paid ads are quick. Paid ads you can scale into. Paid ads you can also spend a ton of money in a day and get no results and that money's gone forever, right? Versus content that's like this ever growing and compounding wheel. So I easy answer is do both, right? Um and if you're like strapped for time and whatever and you need money now style thing and like you're trying to grow this quick, it's paid. But I would always be producing stuff organic to begin to build in that direction. We went we're like too late to the party on having organic as like our core source. But yeah, so I think that answers your question, but organic is better for P&L, longer term, better brand, all that kind of stuff. But if you don't have something or if you're trying to do like an offer that's like, you know, a flash and it's going to be gone in three months or a year or whatever, like just go for paid and make it work because organic building around something is going to take x amount of time to do. Generally, there are people who pop off on this and do really well really early. Um, but like the general norm is it takes longer. Um, what is the proc what is the I'm sorry. What's the process if you came across a sales call that isn't compliant? And what specifically you have found material both sales that that non-compliant that surprised you? Also, do you magically lose those called recording? Um, so yeah, we have scripts around this and then we also have AI checkers that are on the back uh in the back end um that will check all this kind of stuff. So there's just tools you can use and you can do it like out of I mean you can either use tools that already exist or nowadays it's like pretty easy to just like plug in open API like just plug it into Zap, plug it into whatever and have those done. HubSpot has auto recordings of those done. Um and then the real thing here is solving for it on the front end more so than solving for it on the back end. And that is more around the scripting and how it's done. Like yes, people can go off script, but you want to kind of train on not having that. make sure that the script is built in a way that's not that uh that doesn't have stuff like this. Um and then again, we don't our whole methodology for what we do is like is long-term. This is not quick fix. This is not, you know, overnight. This is not XYZ. Um you know, all these CL, excuse me, all these client results are from, you know, a year or more of the program. So, I don't know. We're not We don't really live in this land, so I don't know. But there's like Anuk made an entire book on this that you can you know take templates I'm sure and use stuff and then you can always look backwards with AI uh really easily. What are your thoughts on this? If I want to gift someone entry in a program by covering the cost, what what would be negatively affecting the likelihood of them using succeeding in said program as there aren't ones that are committing financially? Would you book them the call and then have them contact you about the investment or ruin surprise price reveal and send them them up front? How would you go about doing this? Top five rhymes for sure. By the way, I'm not sure what that means, but um so we've done this in the past, way early days. Uh it was actually funny. One of the initial people we gave a test product because we launched a new product. We were like early early days, like we were doing like 30 grand a month probably. Uh we gifted somebody the program as like uh we're launching this new thing and we want to get some feedback on it. And that person then went through the product. They ended up buying the next product we came out with that was probably $1,000 at that time. and then uh became one of the sales reps, was our top sales rep, then became our sales manager and was a rockstar right at the time uh for what we needed and where she was at in life and all that. So, there are edge cases that will work. Um you're right though, most people that come into it, unless it's like some crazy qualified but like can't afford sponsorship opportunity or scholarship more so opportunity, um generally speaking, they're not going to take it as seriously because they didn't put money up. they didn't figure out a way to make it work. They aren't doing it in that way. Um, but there's definitely ways to do it, right? Um, there are things like people do giveaways and like sponsorships of that. It's like over these five days, everyone submit into this thing and you know, we're going to pick one that's a winner that's going to get sponsored for a yearong free of the program, which only costs you your delivery. So, if it's a course, basically nothing. Uh, if it's info or if it's coaching, it costs you paying a coach for a year or six months or whatever. issue with that a lot of the time at scale is that then people don't purchase over that window because they think they're going to be the one of 5,000 people that entered. So your like close rates just tank. Um that happens a little bit internally too if you do it for like renewals, but the beauty with renewals is they kind of batch, right? So well they can batch. So yeah um uh yeah I mean yes do it. I don't know that you'd make a big like deal about it. Um, but if you find someone that you think is going to be able to succeed because they have done XYZ and they are like yearning for it, but they can't afford it and you see some reason to give them to that either out of like morally or out of the good of your heart or because you see them ascending into something later or joining your team, like yeah, do it. Who cares? Just understand the cost because if it's coaching, you have a real cost and if it's info, you have an XYZ cost. So yeah, the programs you bought or torrented. Dude, I haven't torted something in like ever, 20 years. Um, are torrented, we don't judge. Rate them one out of 10 from quality while you bought. All right. Um, let me pull this up. I have a list of all of these courses. Um, I made an entire video on this, so actually just look that up because that'll be easier. I don't want to waste a bunch of people's time, but um, the core ones that stand out in my head are Becker's that he no longer sells. He sold Iron Mastermind, I think it was called at the time, and it was a Trojan horse to get people into Hyros. Um, that was a really good one. And then at the same time, I bought consulting. Um, I bought one of Sam Ovens's course back in the day, his mid-level program. Instantly learned that I was not going to be the type that was going to be, um, you know, the consultant and like sell my info and all that kind of stuff or whatever. So, uh, in that course though is where I met the co-founder of the current company and they were doing, you know, 30 grand a month and joined up with them and the rest is history. So, I met them in that course. So, that was the best one. But, I have bought tons of courses. I just posted on X. Like I bought two or three courses in a weekend and we implemented pieces and parts of all of them and put together the VSSL funnel that then did 70 million for us. So like I always buy courses non-stop um whenever we need something. So like Cole Gordon has some really good stuff that we've bought for sales management. Um we've bought stuff on YouTube ads when we wanted to learn and implement YouTube ads. We've bought things on physical e-commerce and like Tik Tok shop when that was like a thing we were interested in and we never actually launched. Um, we've bought stuff. I have a whole list over here. I've done a ton of affiliate stuff. We've bought Peter Kell stuff, VSSL expert. Uh, we've bought like peak performance or like an individual like for yourself things. We've bought a ton of ecom courses, agency courses, social media scaling, native building. I bought Wall Street prep classes, which are like L. Like I bought all these things. Um, so I could make an entire video on this. Again, I already did, but I could make it probably cleaner. But yeah, go check out that one. Um, Ryan, I'll keep it real with you. I'm 20. I started saddling Asia. I run a YouTube marketing agency focused on AI and SAS companies, and I've been struggling to land clients consistently. Right now, I've got two clients. One came from random Twitter and one in March, but they churned. Okay. I do about 20 to 25. Okay. So, you're trying to do outreach me outreach messages. Um, you've tried the free game. I have two two case studies, six testimonials, and I'm known for content. Since pivoting towards marketing, my numbers dropped unless I put AI in our title or caption. So now I'm wondering, should I lean back into AI to pull people into my YouTube offer? Is that something else I'm missing? Why promote AI? People are coming to me for this. I help with full YouTube process, strategy, scripting, SEO posting. I'm trying to charge a minimum of two and a half thousand a month. Any feedback would mean a lot. I have affiliate marketing deals. My expenses are like $200 a month. I don't go sightseeing or anything. Maybe once every two months. Okay. So you're working hard. you're doing in Asia, you're young, you have some clients uh success stories, but people are not buying your thing. So core thing is your offer. If you had an amazing offer, you wouldn't even need to market at the root of it because you would get so many referrals and you would have such good results that people would tell everybody about you. So that's case in point one. Two is how you're getting them to you, which right here, you're trying to do outreach messages. is I can tell you right now I have 50 of these in my DM a day about basically doing this strategy scripting editing thumbnails SEO posting um so having something that's unique offer um like you said trying to do work for free um but yeah you need to hone in the offer and then yeah you need to figure out a consistent way to where is it consistent way to generate clients starting with the offer then the lead flow okay so that's what I would say there um and then also like if you're already building these you know how to do this I I don't know anything about this, but I see tons of people doing this faceless like AI content and stuff and like crushing it. So maybe there's a game where you're not doing an agency like when you can just do it for yourself. So I don't know why you wouldn't just build your own. Um whether that's the faceless ones, whether that Yeah, like because that sounds like the easiest one. And then you can be on any time zone, you can do whatever you want whenever you want. You don't have client calls. You don't have agency work. You don't have clients. Like you're just like cranking out AI YouTube content and you already know how to do this part, the SEO, the posting. So like you can already build it up. And you said you have affiliate marketing deals. like lean into a bucket that I mean agency's nice is because you have no out of pocket and I'm sure there's a cost to like generate those AI videos, but unless you have an offer and you have good enough case studies and testimonials and then you have consistent lead flow and you want to be on whatever time zone managing clients and doing your thing, like I don't know enough about this game. So, this is actually kind of like probably not my lane to be talking about. But yeah, that's what I would do cuz right here like they're churning client churn is so real. Like you can just own these assets. So that's my thought. Not a topic, but you should get Matt Larson. I will look him up. Um, I built my brand in self-help market in Hungary. Sold more than 1K from one low ticket product. Sold more than 1,000. Is that $1,000 or 10,000 people? Um, now I want to build the same funnel in English. I was thinking about three different offers priced at 27, 3747, maybe only two offers. No mid ticket. My goal is to reach as many people as possible. I would do it through cold traffic. Have experience creating viral videos. Can I make it work and scale to 510K? How would you recommend the best resource for mastering low ticket funnels? Um, low ticket funnels, I would go into Alen Sultanic. He's in nothing held back group. I would just start there in general. I don't know enough about this. I don't know why you'd have multiple offers. Um, unless they're in Ascension. I would do one straight line. I would sell one offer. I'm not sure if your self-help worked because it was in Hungary and native and like local language and then you're going to try and run it in English and it's not going to work or if your product's good enough that it will work globally or in US market or whatever. I don't I don't know enough about that. um four years. Can I make it work to scale to 5K, 10K or even higher? I assume what you're saying is this. So yeah, I mean if it's a bigger market, but like 1K either in dollars or people is likely not that large in this market, but I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. So again, need more context, but go into nothing held back group and he'll be able like he has automatic clients that's all about low tickets. Um Josh Gavin has a bunch of stuff that's about low ticket um that they do. There's a ton of guys in that group that do a lot of low tickets. So that's probably your best starting point, but you probably can go deeper here before you have to try and do this English market if you have like a hold already in this best payment processor outside of Stripe. I process about 100 to 2K 100. So we still use Stripe because we have very low chargebacks. We have good fees with them, but there's it's a big risk um because they store and tokenize everything and like it's all trapped inside there. So we have backups. Um again, this is another thing. go into uh I think your name is Patricia inside um the Nothing Held Back group. There's tons of people in there. Um Deposit is one. There's a bunch of different um NMI guys. There is uh authorized.net. Like those are all like the top the mid layer, but then they'll get processors that are like under there. The mids they'll they will be able to get you different mids that then sit inside those. Um so yeah, and then it can just plug into whatever you use. So the other thing is Um, so just go over to the WAP guys and yeah, they have you get instant approved basically for anything and you can do size through them. So they do have some fees that are a little different, but it makes sense and works and like everyone's already on the platform and they also have out of the box third party financing. So I would do that um because that's a pretty, you know, you don't want to get stuck anywhere with that. Um, I makeund 100 to 150k per month in my agency but constantly fear the agency game is a ticking time bomb and it'll be replaced by AI or go out of business. are these normal fears that you face. How do you deal with fear of losing it all, losing it all once becoming successful? Um, and you don't deal with this. Um, but this is solid. And I don't know what the service is, but the real thing is, and Eddie Malof talks about this, right? He he runs a large agency, but they talk about how they're just using AI internally. So, that's the goal here. I don't know what the service is that if someone can just directly do it on their own but like you at least internally can be saving huge huge if your team is using it or you have a couple people on team instead of a 30 person team you have a 15 person team because they use AI in a good way so your costs mo you know go down and but you can do the same amount of service so I would start there is just in doing it inhouse and then seeing where it goes um but yeah I mean this is real and this is like I've heard uh my first million podcast they talk about this, you know, you're at 20 or 50 million or whatever. Um, and you still fear this. So, that's about how you store your cash. That's about how you live your lifestyle. That's about how you've upgraded your lifestyle and now all of a sudden you spend 50 grand a month because you make 100 150 and it's like that is where it starts to get funky versus like stockpiling cash or putting in XYZ safe investment or whatever. Um, to make it so you don't have this fear of losing it all. Um, but the inflow is real. The fear of losing the inflow is real. And knowing how to build this to sell it, knowing how to build this in a way that is has more cash flow because you're using AI inside the business because you guys find something that you're doing with AI and then you sell that as a specific service. Just like being on the front. So um EP or whatever his name is always, you know, front runners like you need to be ahead of this stuff and just focus on that mindset. Um okay, I can do some videos on that. Uh, what's your opinion on guarantees versus no guarantees for scaling a coaches coaching business to a million ARR? Okay, you already have over 50 documented case studies, but close rate on VSSL traffic sucks. 5K into 5% into a 12K offer. Um, all right. So, a couple things here. Uh, guarantees. Yeah, there's a lot of ways to look at guarantees. You just have to actually they have to be compliant and you have to abide by them. Um, but guarantees like if they're legit and it's actually reasonable for the person to follow it, like if they do XYZ thing and they don't get the result, then you give them their money back, like all good. Um, if they, you know, if you make them do a million in one hoops to jump through, like those are kind of gray area in my opinion, guarantees. Um, but it depends. I guess it depends because like I like those, right? So, I like some actionbased guarantees, but just has to be not too crazy. Um, there's a lot of them out there. And again, it's just making sure it's compliant. You don't need guarantees, though. If your offer is good enough, you don't need a guarantee. We didn't do guarantees for a very long time. Like, we even still I mean, we do have one now, but like even then, um, a million AR is what, 100K a month. It's 83K a month. Um, I'm not sure why that target what that target is or what, but again, you can either use them or not. You shouldn't need them if you have a good offer. Um, but it's always nice you can throw on there, uh, as long as it's realistic for them to be able to do it. Um 50 documented case studies is good for sure, but close rate on your traffic sucks. 5% it depends on what you're saying 5% is. If 5% is of leads, that's good in our in my opinion depending on it's all about your economics. So it's like if you have $5 leads, that's a fantastic CPA if you if you're doing lead. But if that is your if it's 5% of calls and you have a $200 call, that is not good, right? Because you have what is that? $4,000 CPA on a 12K offer. Like not great. Not bad, but not it's not terrible, but it's not great. So, depends on what it is there. But that's your funnel, entire funnel. That could be your VSSL. That could be your I mean, that could be the whole thing. You I have no idea. So, I don't know if it's your ads. I don't know if it's your opt-in page. I don't know if it's your VSSL. I don't know if it's your application. I don't know if it's your sales reps. I don't know if it's your show rate. Like, there's a lot of numbers here that I can't tell by just hearing 5%. And again, I don't know if you're talking about 5% close rate, if you're talking about 5% show rate, if you're talking about 5% opt-in rate. So, you can DM me about this. But yeah, you need to solve for the funnel because 50 documented case studies is good. So, yeah, I'm getting real traction on an on on an anonymous Tik Tok sharing entertainment behind the scenes. Look at my niche career. Not this is my life of an IB analyst, but more along the lines of vending machine investment education. Getting real specific. There's clear interest and I believe a low ticket info product or paid community to be a great fit. If you were starting from scratch and aiming to go from 0 to 10k per month, how would you map out? Yeah, so you can either the the best way to do it is to give away something for free. Um, so have them join a community where you give value in there. That's just nuggets in a free community. Um, so all that's doing is moving the audience from somewhere you don't own them to somewhere you kind of own them. So whether that's an email list, whether that is uh a Facebook group, whether that's a school group, whether that's a  group, whatever. Um I would move them into a group. Uh so you make a free one. You push them from there to there. So then you own them. Own them. Own the data uh through email and you own the data through a group and you provide a bunch of value to them and then you offer something on the back. So you have a 2K, you have a 5K, you have whatever that is structured education, that includes group coaching, that includes onetoone coaching, whatever. Then you go down like the offer matrix. So you go down or whatever you want to call it. Uh where it's one to one coaching is generally speaking the top and that's where you charge like 50 grand depending on what this offer is. It could be two grand I don't know but like generally speaking it's the highest ticket is going to be one to one with you. Then group with you is going to be the next lowest. So that's or the next down the tunch which is going to be call it 20k. Then the next trunch is going to be with coaches like a in a onetoone setting with a coach that you've hired because they're the pro now. And that's going to be X dollars, call it 10K. And the next one is going to be group with that person. Call it 2K or 5K. The next is just going to be a course uh with group coaching. That's going to be 2K. Then the next is just going to be just a course and that's a thousand bucks. Like whatever the math is, but like that's generally the hierarchy. I've also seen those flipped on their head, but that's a different story for another time. Um but yeah, that's how I'd map it out. So, I'd get them all into a free group, get them on an email list, and then come up with an offer that you see as valuable or they see as valuable more so, and then sell that. So, how can I navigate traditional industries such as solar, logistics, and other blue collar boring businesses within sales in general? I don't know what you mean, but with sales in general, yeah, I mean, these principles that you learn online can be applied there, and the principles you learn in bluecollar boring business can be applied online. uh depending on the skill set, just the part of the skill that you're learning is not necessarily the industry. The industry is just where you can go deep in it, right? So solar for example, if you're door knocking and doing that, you get the sales chops for that. There are ways that people that do that remote. There are also internet marketing tactics you can roll in there for inbound calls, for XYZ, for form fills, for leads, for whatever. There are people who do this at mass scale that do hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year uh in the full stack. There are guys that teach how to do solar sales and use info and internet marketing to get leads to sell a course for 2K or 5K to get into solar and teach them that and then put them inside their solar business and then own the whole solar company. There are guys that do it to teach people how to be solo, you know, franchise operators of or I don't know if it's actually franchise but like whatever it's called um downstream of them in solar and then they own the entire solar company up there and the sales agency that connects them with the providers. There are people that do that with everything. So I don't really know what you mean specifically. Um but you look like a cool Gordon for example business model with sales they take they go you know every industry but um let's just say just for internet marketing and high ticket sales they have like the multitrunch. So they have like they teach people how to do it. So they teach a general consumer how to get into online high ticket sales. They have a higher level program that is for B2B that teaches people or like has sales management whatever that then they can deploy these people and then they also sell to sales reps and like you know nine other things. So like they have owned that industry or that skill set uh of in that market right so and then they have multiple ways to monetize they have multiple offers within that stack they have some low ticket stuff they have some mid-t stuff like they just crush. So I don't necessarily know exactly what you're asking but I think that answers the question. So, uh, yeah, you guys didn't ask a ton of questions this week, which was surprising. Um, so pop into here in the request box and ask anything you have. Hopefully, this one was helpful. I feel like it was a lot of beginner questions. Um, today is day 86, 87 of making these every single day. All of them are documented here in www.rclog.comdoc. Um, and you can go by tech, marketing, ops, sales, mindset, any of the things, filter these out. Um but yeah and then if you just go here uh you will be able brought to the main page of that or just the channel and you can see all of them. So short video shorter video today 37 minutes but I will talk to you guys tomorrow.

# Raw Talk on How to Make $6M/mo with Ecom (Elon Moose) | EP86
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpQEKbhNW-M

What's up, guys? In today's video, we've got ecom legend Met on X Elon Moose. That's a fun. How we doing? What's up? Let's get it, bro. Let's get it. We are What's the business right now? Or what's the what's the model you're running? Yep. So, we run a e-commerce holding company. I have uh three other co-founders in the model. So, we run currently two main brands. Um I can give you the short version or the long version of the story of how I got here. Yeah. Yeah, we got time. Let's go. Okay, we got a little bit of time. So, I'll give you a little bit of the the long rundown here. So, yeah, got into e-commerce. Uh, well, I'll even go a little bit before that cuz we're going the long version here. So, before that, I actually started with Instagram growth marketing. So, that's how I really got into the digital marketing world. Um, so back in the time of the explore page with Instagram, there was a way to make content pretty much go viral on demand. It was right when Instagram introduced it. So kind of found a crack in that algorithm over there and there was a bit of arbitrage there. So I was able to grow a few accounts. I got a few clients and that was like my first real taste of just digital marketing as a whole. From there I kind of stopped. I was in university at the time and it was during co when you know I didn't really have much going on and I was looking for jobs at the time at uh I went to Florida State University. They have a very good film program over there, but unfortunately I was film super good, bro. No, they're actually like top five in in the nation there. Um, and yeah, for me when I uh when I got there, I wanted to join the program, but unfortunately I was nowhere near talented enough to get into that program. So instead, um, I was doing creative writing and I'm like, you know what, let me try to get an internship at a a big film company. So I was applying for a bunch of different jobs, HBO, all that kind of stuff. probably applied to a hundred different jobs. Didn't hear back from 95 of them. Heard back from five and four of them were just telling me that I was not even going to get an interview with them. So, I got one interview with HBO. Took the interview, pretty much completely botch it. And then at that point, I'm like, "Okay, you know what? Let me go all into this digital marketing stuff. It's pretty interesting." I saw some, you know, results from the Instagram stuff. So, pretty much locked myself in a room, started learning for, you know, 14 hours, 16 hour days just going down the YouTube rabbit hole. came across drop shipping, started doing some drop shipping, had some success very early on. I got to probably around like 15,000 a month, 20,000 a month within like the first few weeks of doing it. So, I'm like, "Okay, there's something really here." went very deep into it where I wanted to do a lot of the the things that in hindsight you know I'm happy I did all these things but now what knowing what I know I would have taken a completely different approach where I'm like I have to you know now create the perfect product create you know the perfect road map of how I'm going to launch it and I took a bunch of time to actually create a software so at the time I can go into what product I was selling so I was selling foot insoles that's what I would later get into selling but my stepfather um he was a podiatrist. So, I had a little bit of connections into that industry. Learned a lot about just foot and ankle injuries. I know way too much about the foot and ankle. Um, and pretty much developed like a software there where I was trying to create an interactive doctor visit. So, I like did a whole recording with him. invested probably like 10 grand out of my own money, pretty much all the money I had into building a software where we could create like an interactive software to diagnose different foot injuries and then try to lead them to different solutions for it. Uh that completely flopped and I took probably nine months developing that. But at the end of it, throughout that whole process, I started spending a lot of time developing different products because through that process, my stepfather, he actually needed products for his office. And I found out there was a lot of arbitrage there because they were ordering products for about it was this uh compression sleeve for your ankle. It's called Malot Train. And they were buying it for $78 a unit. I was able to get pretty much the same exact quality for $4 in China. So I ordered for his office. He's like, "All right, I got five other offices I can get this into." Got me the connection. So I started going actually B2B on the e-commerce side, making some decent cash flow from that. And then from all that, I'm like, "All right, you know, let me give this another crack. Just go. I'll take the best product that we had over here. Let's give it a launch. So, it was the insoles over there. I'm like, "This product is really good." You know, we've tested it. I've probably got like 30 iterations of this product for the office because that was like one of the main things that they were selling. And that just took off. So, like within a matter of a few months, got to my first six figure months. Then that started scaling up, got it all the way up to around 300,000 a month. And through that, I started going to a bunch of e-commerce networking events, started meeting with some different people, and that's actually where I met one of my first business partners that introduced me to the other B business partners um at an event actually, Alex Fedoff, if you know him. Uh so, shout out ESS. But that's where I actually met my uh first business partner. He was one of the speakers at the event. We connected. We started an agency together while I was still running my own brand. From there, we actually got another partner that he was working with on a separate agency. So, they were doing like a Google ads agency. My specialty was more in like the Facebook ad side. So, this guy was doing Google ads. My partner had done just a lot more of like the finance and understanding a lot more just from like a P&L standpoint, all that kind of stuff. And then one of our other clients that we ended up taking on for the agency had a warehouse in Miami, which was something I struggled with early on was the whole supply chain aspect of e-commerce. So we kind of all came together where we had very unique skill sets where for me I was a direct response Facebook marketer. One of my partners very good with Google ads and understanding that whole infrastructure and more like cold traffic with Google ads. So not just you know the traditional PMAX and you know retargeting kind of stuff. Other partner very good with finance, Amazon logistics and then other one you know had the whole warehouse customer service all that kind of stuff. So we all came together launched a brand that took off super quickly. It unlocked a whole new level level of scale pretty much within within the first 3 months of doing that. I think we got to 2 million a month with one of the products that we launched. Launched another product. Within probably 3 to four months, we were already at 6 million a month. So, we scaled it, you know, insanely quick. I I think mainly because all of us had like those missing components that we didn't have before. And so, all of us had e-commerce experience before. All had done like our own brands. All scaled, you know, to six figure months. But when we kind of all came together, it was all just unique skill sets coming together to really help take this thing off. And yeah, so that kind of leads us to where we're at now. That's a long version of the story, but yeah, it's good. Yeah, a million questions from that. So yeah, to clarify, you don't have to dox like industry or whatever company any be. So you guys launched a new brand. So you three came together and then launched completely new brand, new everything, right, from scratch. Okay, cool. Exactly. Yeah, I see that happen all the time. time. I mean, that's kind of how our model is with three partners where it's like each one lives in their own bucket. It's not as much like with ecom versus info, right? You need the brand face, the product, like that's part of it as one person usually is like the expert of the product and then you have though you have sales and marketing and then you have ops, system, tech, finance, like that bucket. So, that's basically our model too for the for partnership. Um, but yeah, I I mean we're in what's it called? Ezra Firestone's blue ribbon mastermind and dude it just the people in there and the deals that get done and connect like masterminds. So talk about talk about that. So talk about your because you said you go to masterminds, you went to meet these people like is it constant, right? You always see something new in like e-commerce education that's either you know like I know people that are like oh right now I'm teaching this education specific thing. They're doing hundreds of thousands a month teaching people how to do Facebook ads uh basically for that like is there always a new trend? Are you in all the communities and they change the content? Like how do you learn this? Yeah, it's a great question. Um, nowadays I'm actually in pretty much no communities, but early on it was definitely like I I definitely want to give a lot of credit to being in communities to helping me grow as quickly as I think I did. Um, because I think in those early stages there's a lot more access to the information you need. So like when you're at, you know, 50K a month or, you know, when I joined the program, I think my my store was probably it was actually like when I first was getting started is when I joined the program. So I think I was at like 15k 20k with the insoles like the first month that I launched it and then I was able to scale it up to like 100 grand within 90 days from there or so. So I think that gap of information of like 10k to 100k there's a lot of really good experts that can help you get there super quickly and you know you could try to explore on your own and I think you can have a lot of success just going you know on YouTube and especially now with the amount of information that's out there you can definitely do it all your on your own but I think also at the time when I was doing this there was less free information in terms of how to scale so that stage crucial I think where it becomes a little bit more difficult is more the stage where I'm at now and you know I'm I'm curious for you cuz I know you joined a bunch of masterminds and you'll probably have some good recommendations for me because this is something I've struggled a bit with. Um cuz I've joined other programs since then. Um I joined uh and maybe not the best programs for e-commerce specifically. I don't want to actually name any cuz I I don't want to talk bad about any of the the public ones. Um but I joined a few and I wasn't as impressed with a lot of like the ones that I've joined since the the initial growth. Um, so I'm curious from you like what are some of the best that you've been in and like what kind of results has that got for you? Yeah, the example you just said, right? Well, so like we are in uh Blue Ribbon. We still play Pay Root Blue Ribbon. I don't even know what it is now. 1,500 2,000 something a month. I've heard really good things about them by the way. Fantastic, bro. He is such a genuine like transparent dude. And there are whales in there. Like we were at one and the AG1 guys were I'm sorry. I think it was either AG1 or uh what's the mushroom one? the rise everyday dose. No, there's like the big big one. Uh Mudwater. It was either Mudwater or I'm blanking so hard. I'll think of it in 30 seconds. It's got to be one of those ones. Got to be one. Um but yeah, I mean those guys are just in the room like at the networking event. It's cool. So how he does his is kind of similar to like almost how I'm doing this except obviously packaged 9,000 times more and with a payw wall because I think people value it more and then it's inner community. So he's basically building he has brands and I think he actually might have exited some of them now but he has the ecom stuff where he started now he has software now he has like private equity stuff now he has a million things software to Shopify he was the uh ocu or whatever that thing's called like yeah yeah we use his software actually we've done a lot of money with his software yeah so like he's built all this stuff in the ecosystem and then all around at the same time he has literally he'll pop open his ad accounts he has you know Molly in there which at a at the time was whatever there's all these connections of his team that then share all this stuff as paid. So they will then create all these resources. You become a member, you get access to their whole library of stuff on Smart Marketer or whatever it's called now. Um yeah, it's amazing. And then like literally the group coaching calls and the weekly stuff is you just pop on there and he's like, "Okay, here's this new ad account thing. Here's how we're doing promotion calendars. Here's this new thing we learned about 3PL or this new processing thing or this new AI retargeting thing that came out that we're testing. Here's our results so far." He's just like open a screen share and just go through his stuff like he's he's sold me already, bro. I'm joining after this call, bro. Yeah, I don't even know what it is. I think it's at the time maybe it was 10 or 20. I don't even know actually, but I I know it was probably five figures I think to join and then whatever recurring, which I also FYI to anyone love that model for proper more like B2B masterminds. I think it's great to kind of gate it a little bit and then have the recurring versus just like this low recurring because people come in and try and like just eat everything and then dip and you want the community. That's the big thing. He is the most genuine like he'll even say he's like, "Oh, it's like my family. It's like my family in here." And he's so close-knit. People stay so sticky. So, that one for there. And then I'm on the hunt. Uh I'm trying to navigate who it is for info coaching. I just I I posted on X or tweeted. I don't even know what you're supposed to say anymore, but I post it on there. I'm trying to find what it is for info and coaching because right now almost everyone's language is around personal branding and like how to monetize your personal brand. It's like, okay, that's not how it not to say that won't work. Obviously, it's working for a lot of people, but that's like for the person who wants the personal brand versus old language was about kind of like how to become a coach, consultant, how to monetize your skill set, which is different than a personal brand. Um, but I can see how they're like in alignment. But I'm trying to find that because I'm trying to find who are like the goats in that space. Um I'm scheming on some stuff. But I want But you joined Iman's thing, right? Yeah, dude. Iman's a legend. I mean, he's the goat for sure. And that his is framed a lot. His is a great example. His is framed a lot about personal branding thing. And that's like kind of the reason that I did it at some level. It really was. I just paid my 20 grand and then it was a case to like record and all this. He teaches they teach so much stuff in there like access to the education the or I'm sorry the access to the sea level um or in the coaching calls the school but the big thing with that is like uh they go so far in that direction and I'm like doing this like they're like all the film stuff they have like three-hour videos on how to do this and this and this and like studio setups and lighting and clipping and like doing and like owning your own distribution and I like literally went I watched it all but I like went this far into actually doing it. But yeah, he does great. But that one uh that one is built for people who do over 250k and then he's got a whole suite of other programs. But he's a legend. But to give you your flowers, bro, I think you're a monster, dude. You've you've been consistent. What is this? 87 in a row, bro, of just posting every single day. 85, I think, is you and me. No, 86. Nice, bro. I was telling you when we spoke like, bro, I started the personal brand similar time, I think, to you. And I've been doing maybe one every like one or two weeks. And bro, that's a pain in the ass. So I can imagine just doing it every single day. I think you you've got a rhythm though of how you're doing. I've definitely got a rhythm down. I'm definitely hacking it a little now where I do these because the creation of the mirror board, the ideation like even though it's so basic, it like did take me a while and I was just kind of trying to be like what's hot now, which is like in the beginning it was all about the marketing stuff. Then it was all about sales and like stuff. Now it's all about data, tech, systems, and ops. And it's like that's where I'm like actually thinking. And I don't know, it kind of bounces a lot. But when I do these, they're nice because people pick up nuggets. So yeah. Yeah. I mean if you want to get I mean I'm sure what people want and again back to my process. I didn't do the proper tweet before this one or yesterday because I'm busy and [ __ ] and I'm like oh I have a call and uh so apologies. There's no queue of questions we have from these but I did look and I have X open right now. So everyone talks I mean you talk MR game which is obviously different. You talk a lot of paid which is pretty normal but like not sure if you go beyond that. And then yeah I mean subscriptions and paid right like what are what are some nuggets in there? like where are you where do you guys scale in? Do you do one-time upfront and subscription? Do you only do subscription? Do you do subscription on the back end? What's churn expected on that kind of stuff? Does it change from skew? Like deep drive. Yep. Um so the subscription stuff has been probably the biggest breakthrough I've had in probably the last like two years of doing this. It's like you know I think initially we had a a separate model where our our method of scaling is kind of what I was saying in the beginning where I think the collision of all the different skill sets between me and the co-founders here where we were able to bridge the gap between cold traffic on Google and cold traffic on Facebook. I think that combination together while also being able to manage the supply chain aspect and backend process of scaling that all up was the first like big arbitrage opportunity of being multi-channel to cold traffic that allowed us to get to multi-millions a month in scale. Now I think this is probably a bigger revelation where we've always gone with selling more physical types of products. So like the subscription stuff has been newer and we've got very creative with different ways of how we've looked at it. Um but now moving to more of these consumable products where it's a different landscape but for us you know the the big difference just to you know simplify it for and I'm sure a lot of the guys that are already doing you know supplements and stuff like this this is going to be very basic for them. But for the people that aren't as aware of like how the model really works is the difference is where the way we were doing it before is we were always trying to maintain between 15% and 20% profit on day one sales and we were doing that at multi-millions a month in scale. So as we were scaling up to you know 4 million a month 6 million a month we were doing that profitable on that first day purchase. Now the difference of this model and where we're shifting and we haven't gone all the way to this side because it's a it's a very fine line of balancing your cash flow to be able to manage it and this is like the direction where we're going where I think by hopefully the next year I don't I don't want to you know be too premature in it but like my goal over the next we'll call it two years is to get to around 10 million a month in scale. Um and I spoke with some you know good people on this that are in the space where they also changed my perspective. I don't want to go on a tangent. I'll come back to that after in terms of if you actually want to scale that aggressive, which was super interesting. Um, but the model here is that within 90 days, the goal should be, and this is how the big brands that are doing it. So, if you look at rise coffee, if you look at everyday dose, they're doing it based on breaking even usually within a 90-day window. So, for us, we're profitable on day one. For them, they're breaking even sometimes even longer. like the the more money that a brand has, some people will extend that out to 6 months. But beyond that, it gets a little bit risky because even if you have a shitload of data, it still gets a little bit murky in terms of like how far you want to go out with it. And that's why I think a lot of the the brands uh the big brands like Casper, for example, and those ones, they were trying to extend it out all the way to a year where they're going to try to like break even on that. So that's where I think it gets a bit murky because now your cash flow cycle is getting delayed and delayed. Um, but 90 days is a sweet spot from, you know, the consulting that I've done and the different brands that I've spoke to and a lot of the poaching that I do. Um, which is consulting within itself is that's that's kind of the sweet spot. So, what happens here is, you know, to illustrate it with very simple numbers is let's say your average order value is $50. Let's say that you need a two return on ad spend to make that 20% profit margin. Let's just use that for the example. So that means you have $25 to go and acquire a customer at that $50 average order value price point. Now what happens is if you can extend that out to now 90 days and let's say it's breaking even and not making that two return on ad spend. So let's say the break even is a 1.5. Um and not to do mental math because I don't want to get embarrassed here on the spot. So let's do 50 50 divided by 1.5 would be $33. Um, so based on that, let's do 50 divided by 33. That would be okay. So we got to the 1.5 on that. Um, so what would happen there is that you can now spend at the break even number within a 90-day window, you could extend an additional, excuse me. Sorry, I'm just going to do the the math on it. You're good. Plotting into the calculator over here. I'm over here still trying to think of my mushroom thing. Yeah. So, yeah, long story short, not to get too caught up on the math, but pretty much what you can do is now go at a one:1. So, instead of because you're going to move this back to day one acquisition and to not over complicate on that math, pretty much what will happen is on day one, instead of spending $25 to acquire that $50 customer, you can now spend $50 to acquire that customer. Because what will start to happen is over 90 days, depending on what your retention cohorts cohorts are, excuse me, for month one, two, and three. So, let's say you retain 70% after month one, 50% after month two, 30% after month three. we'd have to plot all these numbers out. So that's why I'll just use like makebelieve numbers so we don't get too in the weeds of it. Um but pretty much in that case like let's just say now you could spend $50. So you can double the cost of acquisition that you were spending before still break even in 90 days and then probably make the same amount of profit within like 6 months. So what that does is now it allows you to outbid your competitors which in Facebook you know I know you're a big Facebook marketer. I don't know if you're doing the marketing directly but you know I'm sure you know all about that. So the person that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins. So that's the super simplified version of it. Obviously there's a lot more complexities to it. Um so now the game becomes more so how do you optimize those really the first three month cohorts because if you're going to do it on a 90-day window then you want to get your retention rate on month 1, two, and three to be to be as high as possible obviously. Um but then also you know it's doing the things that you would do normally. So maximizing your AOV, you also want to maximize the thing beforehand, which is how many people from new customers are opting into your subscription program to begin with because, you know, if you're first launching it and you're doing like an option to subscribe and save, you might give them 20% off, but if you're only getting, you know, 20% of people to opt into the to the subscription model, then you can't really base your whole business model around it. So then it's figuring out how do you get that to 80% plus. That's what you have. So happy to go deeper on that. Yeah, let's go deeper on that because I want to talk too, right? So we're talking you said your first breakthrough and your second and I don't know how fast you want to go through first but so breaking it on cold on Google. So when you're doing that is that what what do you mean by that? Is that breaking it on search? Is that on shopping? Like I'm not super familiar. I mean what we do is all branded and then we'll do YouTube we'll do you know stuff like that like a little we don't really cold search but we'll do cold YouTube and like GD you know some stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. So for us at the time it was actually cold search but I think it can be a lot of like it doesn't have to just be Google I think that's just the example that worked for us but I think if you can have two sources whether that's apploving you know that's a big one nowadays in e-commerce where a lot of people are scaling just as aggressively as they were on meta with applovening so that's one right like Tik Tok is another one uh YouTube can be another one so all these together they uh when when you combine two of them together to acquire new customers customers. I think that's where you get the real breakthrough because now you're not just relying on Facebook. And the example I give with Facebook is that the way it works is it's very volatile and especially if you're doing the model that I was mentioning before where you don't have that subscription revenue coming in. You don't have that 90-day lifetime value coming in. You're relying on making money on day one. So with Facebook, the the nature of the platform, especially after iOS, is that you'll have some days that are amazing, some days that will go down, and it's just going to be volatile. even at higher levels of spend. It's just the nature of the platform. So, when you can balance that out with another channel that can have consistency because the odds of both of them not doing well on the same day is very unlikely because it's different customer segments that are, you know, shopping on each of those platforms. So, it keeps a lot of stability in the business, especially as you're trying to scale up. So, like if Facebook has a [ __ ] day, Google search probably can still do well that day or you know, YouTube ads or Tik Tok or whatever it may be. So that was kind of the first breakthrough to creating more stability where search for us was kind of like the stable backbone because it was a lot more consistent, a lot more profitable but less scale capacity where Facebook we could scale way more aggressively but it was a lot more volatile and numbers would go up and down up and down. So that was the first piece. Got it. Yeah. And then second piece so 80% take on subscriptions. So is it what is that framed as subscription only and then there's it's almost the other way around. So it's like or you pay it one time for an increase. Yeah. So actually for us we would probably be closer to 100%. Um but the problem is so we do installment payments and so we use shop pay for monthly installments. So we let people break it down into like four different payments and they actually don't allow you to do subscription on it. So the way that we do it is we send it very similar to Rise Coffee that they're the best example to study um in this model. So they do it where pretty much they send you to a page and your only option is to subscribe to get the offer. So they give you a bunch of [ __ ] with the product that you buy. It's a really compelling offer and to get that offer, you have to subscribe or you can go to like Amazon and buy from there like individually, but if you're going to buy from their Shopify website, you only have one option. So that for us, yeah, that for us has worked the best. Obviously, you like you can't do that in a sketchy way. You have to let people know that they're subscribing. You have to put in I'm on it right now. I'm on it right now. Yeah. And it opens me up in shop pay as my initial because I'm already in there. But then all the bonuses basically. Yeah. Exactly. So they give you app, your magnet, your spoon, your scoop, but then but then they do an automatic discount and then drop you to $27 a month. And funny enough, you mentioned like the mushroom coffee brands, but like all those guys are pretty much running the same exact model. So they're all running it just like that. And that's how all of them are scaling. And that's really the only way like especially if you're in one of those niches where you're competing against people that are doing the model that I just spoke about, you're [ __ ] right? Like if you're going to do it without like a subscription program when these guys can spend, you know, some of them like some of these mushroom coffee brands are probably going all the way up to 6 months breaking even before they make their profit. Yeah. You're screwed. You're cooked. like you can't compete against that unless you have, you know, either really strong lifetime value that's not associated with a subscription program or insanely high AOV and average order value that you have like a direct response salesunnel that you're fully like boosting everything. Then that's the other option. You could frontload a lot of that initial average order value and be able to scale. And that's how like some of the DR guys have got to like 100 million a year with no subscription. So, that's that's kind of the options I would say in D TOC if you want to get to 100 million is either monster AOV. My bad for Bing. I just got too excited on the AOV. Um, Monster AOV or uh the LTV. Interesting. Okay. So, do you know these rise guys before we just do this before I start talking about them more? I don't want I don't want to torch someone's funnel, but I guess we're already in it. Um, I don't know them personally. I don't know the founders now. So, like this example, let's just because I just want to use an example on this. So these guys right $27 right now and I don't know how to share screen on this cuz it's telling me I need to restart my computer and whatever and I don't care. So uh it so they're basically it says $27. It's normally 36 a month uh and it's 27. So they are just hammering at this one skew and let's talk like backend. Let's talk fulfillment. So these guys what like how easy is it? I have I'm so off base on this. Like we talk maybe about supplements and all this kind of stuff and even you and I chat about that but like I don't even know where to start. I mean I have the people in in in DM and in message that's like oh we can white label this or we can custom formulate this like what is this as an example or again without doxing your own stuff like how do you go about that like in terms of like sourcing the product? How would I make that product and how much would it cost me to make that product for example? Yeah. So for all consumable products, I definitely recommend doing it in the United States. Uh in terms of the actual like process there, so that's one of my partners that handles all that. So full shout out and credit to him on that um for, you know, sourcing all that. But pretty much the process at a high level for that is, you know, you have to it it's difficult with consumables. It's definitely more difficult than when you're selling like physical products because there's usually pretty highQ that you're going to need for the initial base purchase. So unless you have some money to invest or if you're willing to, you know, search through, you know, 50 100 different people that are willing to get you, you know, a lowQ to test it out that you can like really sell them on the on the vision of why they should. And, you know, for someone like you though, for example, where you have a successful business that you can show them that, it's going to be much easier for you where if I was someone that was just starting that wanted to do it, it's going to be more challenging obviously. Um, but I think that also the other piece is if you have good connections, like we actually met our person from a, so this is, you know, a little bit of a backtrack, but we were going more in like the at a point we were at like five different brands, six different brands. Uh, and I don't know if you can even call them full brands because we were more just like individual products that were starting to scale up and we're like, all right, do we develop this into like real brands? Um, and through that we actually were going to partner with a pretty big influencer in the fitness space. And with them, they actually had a connection because they already started like developing a product with this guy and like they had, you know, some clout, some, you know, recognition. They already had the product like in in the process with this guy. So, he was able to give us like pretty lowQ like test out a new concept, test some stuff out where we were actually able to then build a really good relationship with him to like start all the process. So connections is another really good way of like how you can get started with it. But I guess high level like the problem in the beginning is that high order quantity is required usually to develop your own type of consumable product. There is another option where you can actually just white label. So if it's like a very generic product um where you don't want to go as much in the formulations. There's a lot of you know facilities that will do it. You're just going to pay a premium on your average unit cost if you do it that way. Um, so that's a good way to test and validate a concept and then start to do some custom formulations from there. Like if you want to get started pretty early on it um but I highly advise against doing it in China which I see a lot of people doing now especially with like the Tik Tok stuff that all that stuff that's going on with Tik Tok shop obviously. Um, the problem with going into China with all this stuff, and it's not to say that all suppliers will be like this, but there is very little regulations in terms of the actual products that they're putting in and the actual dosages of each product, even if they are using good ingredients. Um, so yeah, long story short, you're going to probably get into some uh compliancy issues if you do that with them. Uh, maybe not right away, but, you know, it's it's something that you're going to have a big risk. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're huge on brand. Like the reason we didn't even do this initially was cuz it was like a time distraction and all that but also or like a focus distraction but also the quality. So that's why we were like trying to do this partnership route but like you do it with with the big enough partners and like you're only getting whatever 20% affiliate commission or something on top rung and like that math is like okay but right so and you don't get all like there's just all these ones. We had a really good quality one that was like, "Yeah, we'll give you 40%." But they were like of first purchase and it's like the whole point is that it's MR, right? Yeah. So, um, doesn't make sense. Yeah. We played that dance that line of trying to do it and I've talked on here before. We did a partnership with one that was really good, really high quality, all good. Um, which the math didn't math because we were doing the test kit, then they have to talk to them on the phone, then they sell them on the thing and like the drop off rates plus the AOV and whatever. Like the math just didn't math plus the commission rate. So yeah, we're talking about doing it, but brand, like you said, is so important. Quality is so important. And we hear that like, you know, supplements is a shady game. It's a shady game, US or China or wherever. And it's like, how do we make it so they're actually quality? They're actually unique, too, which is another interesting point is like everyone's got a protein powder, everyone's got a whatever. Like how do you do it beyond flavors? And you know, you can just basically match someone who is quality and but your unique piece is your marketing and your branding, right? is like what a lot of these guys say. So yeah, that's kind of the game we're playing with. Well, I'll give like a a nugget on that. Like I think one of the most underrated parts of like the supplement is everyone and their moms is selling, you know, the same types of formulas, right? So if you look at like neutropics for example, if you look at, you know, the the mushroom coffee, right? All those different things. I think the the low-key breakthrough is actually the delivery mechanism of how they get the benefit. So like for example going from like traditional pills to gummies where it's a much more enjoyable experience where it tastes really good. So I think if you look at all the trends especially with those really crowded markets of different supplements whenever there's a new innovation it's always usually because of like the mechanism maybe you know another ingredient or like combining different like different supplements and putting them together like that's one part of it but the actual way that you consume the supplement is a really big way of like how you can break through in saturated supplement spaces. Yeah that makes sense. We we're friends with some guys that do mid eight like or I guess what is that? Not mid eight figures but you know between 10 and 20 a month and they do supplement and it's it's like one hero and a couple like outside and they just crush but theirs is I think I know I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, I don't know. I'll have them on if they'll be on. We're not going to but yeah crush but um their whole idea was you know there's the other difference is that's so front end that's all paid driven. And that's, you know, not all paid, but you know what I mean? Like it's it's really heavy there versus what we're talking about doing is like, okay, we're going to sell it post purchase. So ours is going to be post info coaching. It's going to be like part of it. And then we're like, what do you because that's easier to just provide pure value and have that right there. And like customer acquisition cost is already kind of like drisked or like separated from there. But then the other piece is what could we create that is like what you're saying that's either a unique mechanism that is a mix that is unique in the marketplace in some way shape or form plus the marketing skills to make it so it could stand alone on the front. Um and that's like do we dedicate the time and energy do we just lean into our bucket but yeah subscription it's crazy. Yeah. Well, speaking to you specifically, we we chatted a little bit last time we spoke, but I think with your model, like I think one of the interesting routes which we spoke about last time was like looking to maybe acquire a different brand that already has like a decent run rate that you can build into it. And I think that, you know, going back to the initial example that I said, right, where the goal is if you can break even in 90 days, that gives you substantial room to then scale. I think the difference with your model is if you can find a supplement that directly correlates to the audience demographic that would be buying your programs, that's like a [ __ ] hack because now you're getting those customers. You can break even, but your LTV is going to be even stronger than the guys that are doing the supplements because you have even if it's like 5% of people that end up joining that high ticket program, even less, right? like from those from that customer base, you have like a substantial revenue source on the back end that like stacks on top of that lifetime value because the subscriptions really what it does is it brings predictability to LTV. That's what makes it so powerful is that now you can actually start to look at your data cohorts. You can start to like predict how much revenue you're going to do for the future. It changes the whole way you look at the business, but ultimately all it's predicting is the lifetime value. and you have a way to still raise that lifetime value probably 2x that amount just on the average basis of like getting those people into that program. And I was thinking about Yeah, I was thinking about this after we talked and I was like the only thing I I hang up on that versus doing it from scratch is I mean one there's the cash game and like the return on it and making sure that's there. two is like folding it into the ecosystem in terms and everything in branding in ascension in the ways that make sense because we've done we've had the conversations we've even tested doing it on the back of uh physical products um on supplements on things like that and like it's there but like the consumption and the warmth in order to go from buying a $50 supplement recurring to a whatever high ticket program is like not so you almost need like that middle middle gap and then the branding you know there's potential to have a 5x multiplier style thing. Not like eBay like like just results, not any selling, but like 5x multiplier on if it's branded in alignment and the LA, you know, I don't know that the move is buy something that has all this MR and then just flip the name and flip the color scheme and do whatever. So, it'd be like a Yeah, it'd be very specific to find, but let that interesting point you bring on now because acquisitions. So, yeah. Where where are you guys at right now? So, you said you've had five or six which were essentially just individualized products. You scale them up. E-commerce is super cool to me because inherently it has uh easier than something like info coaching or someone's face and brand uh easier easier to sell right like still you need to get up to numbers good business you know growing all the things but it is easier to do so in my opinion so have you sold any are you going to try and sell any do these even sell yours yeah I I guess without going into too much detail we're in the process of exiting one of our brands so this has been a bigger brand which we've had for a little while So that we're we're trying to exit. And then really right now um you know we've went a back and forth on a lot of different like ideas and concepts of what we could do. Um but what we found is in the process of like scaling up to like and I don't want to call it full-fledged brands because it wasn't developed brands. It was more like again like individual products that we were just scaling up all in parallel. Um but it really drove down the focus and I think that what we saw is the products that we scaled up super quickly initially those ones started to go down in sales and overall the ecosystem went down in sales even though we had more products that were doing you know well individually right so I think that what we found in that is that focus is really the most valuable asset right now in terms of scaling the brands until like the only way I feel like you can really go into that model of having five six seven different brands is that if you're so systematized and you have a fully autonomous or virtually fully autonomous team where you're really just like a strategic person that's coming in there and just like guiding those different brands and everything is dialed like then that that process makes sense and it's a very like repeatable process too. Um but we found that we weren't there yet when we tried to do it. Maybe you know in the coming year or two you know somewhere along those lines maybe we'll get back to that point. But I want to be extra cautious this time just learning from like past mistakes of doing it. So I think once we exit one of the brands, we're probably going to like fully dive into one of the brands that I think has potential to be a multi-figure brand. Um, and I think from like just the the pure numbers that we have right now cuz as I mentioned earlier is that we we haven't fully went into that model of breaking at breaking even at 90 days. like we're we're slowly approaching it cuz it is it is a lot to endure cuz you have to like make sure especially cuz what will happen you know is if you go to 90 days where you're willing to now break even and you can double up how much you're willing to spend on cost of acquisition let's just say you also can then probably scale like 2 3x the amount which means you also have to then um think about how are you going to supply the inventory for that right that that's going to cost you a shitload of money as well to go up to that scale plus you're not going to see that money for an additional 90 days where you have to float it. So that's what the most challenging part that we're finding right now is the actual finance component of like how do you maneuver scaling it especially if you're bootstrapped. Uh and we don't want to raise money as of yet. Um it's not to say that will change in the future. I'm not like closed off to it but for now we're trying to keep everything you know internal. So I think that's going to require a shitload of focus. So for us right now we want to like be super focused on that. Get this thing to you know 10 million a month nine figure brand. And then once we have that, I think also the same thing applies where, you know, what I found is once you figure out how to take a brand to seven figures a month, it becomes repeatable. Same thing with, you know, when you get to that first six figures a month. So I want to get to that, you know, eight figure a month run rate, figure out how to actually do that and then, you know, use that kind of as our basis of like a holding company and, you know, going into there. Yeah. Interesting. Um, because you said that earlier a little bit and I always ask almost everybody on here, uh, like how how far can you take it, right? And this one's a little bit easier of an example, right? How big these e-commerce companies can get a little something like an info coaching where you've got like Tony Robbins and these guys that go up top tier, but beyond that, the there's nobody in the middle or there's very few in the middle. Uh yeah, but yeah, that's So with what your plans are, why Well, let's back up a little bit. So a normal ecom business is what 20% margins like a the healthy one or higher? Uh between 10 to 20%. 10 to 20. Okay. And that's obviously the ones that are heavy on paid. And then yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like if you're more organic focused, you can get it up to like 30%. But yeah, I would say 10 to 20% is pretty standard. And you you'd be surprised, but a lot more closer to that 10% mark. Like 20% is like what everyone kind of shows, but usually, especially at high scale scenarios, especially when we're scaling now to like aggressive months, like 10% is, you know, we're we're happy with that. Yeah, 100%. Um, interesting. And then multiples are industry standard then for get over 2 million, 5 million, 10 million in IBIDA or whatever number and then those are yours, five, eight, 10x's. Yeah. Well, I think that's what's super interesting I guess just about private equity in general, right? Is like the the bigger you can scale a brand, the more the multiples go up. So like in the IBIDA levels, like if you're in that, you know, base 1 to 5 million range, you know, you'll probably see, you know, depending on how well your brand is actually set up, you might get, you know, a 2x multiple on that if it's really shitty. Uh if it's better, you might get like a 4x 5x in that range. Um and that's just really what what people are willing to pay, at least from the experience that I've had throughout this whole buying process. Um, but when you get to that higher level, so like let's say, you know, 5 to 10 million and then 10 million plus, 10 million plus, you could probably see like 5 to 8x, 5 to 10x. If you're in like a, you know, beverage business, you can get like a 20x on it. So like there's really outsized returns depending also on like the type of product, the retention program, like all those different components can really stack up. So it's hard to say like one benchmark for it but like if you're very intentional and you're you know wellversed in e-commerce where this is also what I'm realizing like the more that I understand and you know and this is something actually it's a good way to circle back to something I was saying earlier in the call where I got this advice from from a founder um that I think you know as well but he told me cuz I was saying you know my goal is I want to scale to 10 million a month in the next six months and he's like why do you want to do do that. And I and he's like, "What's your longer term goal?" I'm like, "I want to get this thing to multiple hundreds of millions a year and exit for, you know, 200 300 million." He's like, "Well, you know, those two goals don't directly correlate with each other because if you're saying you want to scale up to 10 million a month within 6 months, do you think that's going to be sustainable?" And I thought for a second, I'm like, you know, I think, you know, with the subscription program, maybe it could be sustainable. But then I thought about like just my my journey so far when I've scaled up, you know, six million a month and then we went down to like four million a month and then even back down to two million a month and then back up like and this is something I've learned in the process of actually selling a brand is the worst possible thing you can have is a decline in your numbers because even if we were to do 10 million one year, scale that brand up to 30 million and then the next year we go back down to 15 million let's just say whereas like let's say instead we went 10 million, 15 million, 20 million or something like that where overall it's going to be less revenue. Let's just say in that example, the second one, but it's steady increases up. That business is going to give you a much better multiple at the end. Even though you had a year that you did better than all the other years and the revenue overall is higher because everything is based on the trailing 12 months. So, I thought about that for a second. I'm like, you know, we probably should do a lot more work on setting up this foundation, right? making sure that the churn is going to stay like making sure that all those pieces like the cohorts are fully optimized within the first three months before just trying to like you know take the brakes off this thing and you know scale as aggressively as possible. So it reframed a lot of how I thought about it um in terms of the exit and I guess that kind of ties into the whole point of you know you should plan with exit in mind if that is your goal. If your goal is to build a brand and you want to have it for the long run it's it's a different story but if you do want to make a big payday think about that when you're starting a brand. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's uh that's so funny you say that because we've increased every single year, right? And last year we went we 3xed and everything broke on the tail end of the year cuz that would have been that I mean that was on pace for instead of 30 it would have been 40 and like mid-40s if we would have kept that trajectory where everything like this and then instead it went like this and like even at the beginning of this year we're like rebuilding we're like can we restart the clock right now because like we're rebuilding everything but it's like if you look at it on annual basis now we're doing this again and it's like if we can get back up we should be able to pass that from last year but if you look month over month it's like you know one of these on cash collected not on revenue because the stuff's over coaching and whatever, but you know, different terms, different whatever. But, um, no, that's super interesting. Um, and then the other thing with that, the like you said, making it a machine, making it in those ways that it could be sold, it's just a different play. It's a different play than cash because you're, you know, you have four extra people on your team instead of you guys just pirating it and you're just paying out those that would be cash straight in your pocket and, you know, navigating that. So, super interesting. Okay. So you've got these two right now and then did you say your your guys peak month that you've done ever was six? Six. Yeah. Six. That's crazy though. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Got to break past it, man. Got to break past it. Yeah. So something like that. And again, I don't want to get details, but like to start something like that for you, and I'm getting a little selfish here, and I keep saying that on these, but I use these for that a little bit, but like Yeah. What's what's your minimum order? Like how much does that thing start cost to start? 50 grand in inventory and load up a Shopify and like go to war or like I mean it depends how scrappy you want to be, right? I I think 50 grand is a good budget to to be conservative, but if you want to be super scrappy, you could probably get it done 10 to 20k to you know if you can find a good supplier that will give you like lowQ to get the initial base like you can probably start to test and validate something within that range. Uh and then also it was something I was thinking about when you were also describing you know your model. I think another big benefit of how you can do it is that you actually have a lot of benefits of how you can keep people retained into the subscription program because I think with the with the supplements if it directly correlates with you know the weight loss and all that kind of stuff and it's a pivotal part you need that goes handinhand with the workouts that people are going to do you can give them extended discounts into your high ticket program when they stay subscribed for like a certain amount of time so there's a lot of like mix and matching where I think you can get multiple benefits, super high LTV and super high retention rates, which is ultimately the most important thing if you're going to do this model is the retention side, which is a big shift cuz for me, you know, everything was always how do I make the most money on day one, which now thinking about retention, it's like a whole new brain that you have to like unlock of like how do you keep people like sustained? How do you make the product as good as possible? Like all those things are way more important than just the the base marketing now. Well, that's why everyone calls us stupid all the time when I talk to him who doesn't have a ton of context and like half I mean they're they're right depending on how you look at it, right? It is stupid to not do it, but it's also not stupid in sense of like how we've position this. But when we had these LOL months, uh this would have been very nice to have whatever number. But like I mean I'm using very simple examples, but it's like okay cool. How do we get to 100K a month in MR? Like call a supplement bundle 150 bucks, right? Like a month and it's probably more. I mean I pay more than that for supplements a month personally and I take three or four things. So it's like 150 that's only 650 units or you know purchases a month. Yeah. Which is like not that crazy assuming we sell you know these are not actual numbers you funnel hackers you. Um but let's say let's say 500 let's say whatever a thous like that's not that crazy to get yeah to get let's say 20% 30% of your customers that come in to then do that. Uh, and then yeah, like we're doing annual plans, we're doing multi-year, like we're doing all these things now. So, yeah, if we can pair those, but that front end stuff is just so fun to us because we're direct guys like in this part of the company. The acquisition side, we like live over here. But yeah, I don't know. You see the scale and the size and it's always been like, oh, whatever. We sell 200 people a month, let's say, and half of them buy supplements and we're making another, you know, 30 bucks in profit per. It's like, who cares? Like, we were we've always been like that. Like, who cares? Which is dumb. I do agree that that because all those dollar those cents add up, you know, to dollars and those dollars add up to lots. Yeah. So interesting, man. Okay. So, but I think I think also just one one point on that is like the biggest thing for you is also, you know, I think the the sellability I don't even know if that's a word, but the sellibility of the company as a whole, right? Like if you can add that front-end product and even get it to that 100k a month and now you have a consumable product that you know is driving a lot of that initial purchases into the whole like program as a whole. That's going to make the business way more valuable. I feel like like just from like an investor standpoint or a buyer standpoint or whatever you guys want to do like raise money, sell it, whatever it is, like I think that's just going to make that process so much easier for you guys. Yeah, I have I was listening to I want to say Josh No. Shout out Josh No. uh I want to say it was him and if it wasn't he's going to get the credit for it anyway cuz he's a legend. Um, but it he basically talked about how when they were selling one of their businesses back when they were attempting to build out I feel like it was Josh who said this. They were attempting to build out basically like another vertical because it was in like affiliate lead gen like that whole game but similar idea, right? So they were attempting to build out this other vertical or had other ones but they had their core main one, right? Yeah. they went to sell, it was essentially just valued off the core one that was actually the machine that actually had like consistency around it and stuff and all these other ones really didn't. So, it's like they put all these resources into these other buckets to do that. And I almost wonder sometimes or Horosi talked about this in one of his more recent pods. He talks about how people stay because they were essentially doing like uh they're they're testing ads for people in local markets with their own money with company money and then once they have proven winners they put them in this deliverable and then people get them and that's like a re one of the many reasons they stay is to get these new ads that are fresh to test in their market or to run in their market. And yeah, when he said that, I was like, that's so interesting because what they really were valued off of in all these different ways, and you can look at it up and down, left and right, but is like certain pieces of the business that are truly recurring, that are truly, you know, an acquisition engine plus a future cash flow game. And like you're right, right? Like, yes, it will value it more. The funny part is is it may be more valuable is where my mind is at is like, is it more valuable? And like there's this whole info coaching game, but then you have subscription consumables that people stay on and that's like valued at some crazy number versus this other piece. And they play hand inand obviously because we'll be using one as acquisition for another and like it'll be a total LTV game. But yeah, we've uh we've done pretty poor and I've said this a lot uh we've done a pretty poor job of maximizing LTV and that was a big reason that why margins took a big dive. I mean like yes well not necessarily why margins took a big dive there but why they kind of continued on was because of how we did the acquisition over here and then how we fulfilled on it without any other offerings really on the back other than like stay for more which was not smart and we burned tens of millions of dollars of opportunity like they sit in some you know lost pipeline basically or like or or churned pipeline so maybe there's some back campaign but yeah we we left a ton on the table for not keeping definitely a bunch and look I I think the other interesting thing and I don't know how this would typically work cuz I'm I'm not as well versed with like the infos space and how everything is sold there but like I almost would think like you know depending on how successful you can do it and how long you can get like a a supplement brand going like let's say you get it you know a year or two really get some good revenue good momentum going on over there I would almost try to sell it to like an e-commerce acquirer or someone that's trying to buy like an e-commerce brand where you frame it you know where this is kind of the lead product and all this stuff that you have surrounding that product and it's like a different positioning of how you present it to like a a potential buyer where for them that's going to be something like they've never seen before where there's whole like coaching program on the back end of it and obviously the margins are unsustainable like if you were like in e-commerce you can't do the same types of margins you do in info um but obviously the sellability part of it is that's like I guess the turnoff on the info spot um so I feel like if you can figure out a way to like merge those and then present it into like a very compelling compelling offer that could be super interesting. And there's also a huge play, you know, but again, this kind of goes back against a point that I said where I think the key thing is like focus, right? And I think you know that more than anyone of just like how much can you take on without miserably, but yes. Yeah. Yeah. Without like losing focus on the main thing that's actually driving the revenue. So I think that's like obviously the the biggest risk. Um, but I do see like especially if the model works and then you can find other products to other front-end products for example that you can go out and acquire that are already doing good run rate. So like test and validate yourself so it's less risk. If that works really well and transitions really well into your overall program then you start buying different entry point brands that you know are lower run rates. You can get good deal. Your personal brand will help you attract probably good buyer or good sellers for that. use that, buy, you know, one or two different purchases. Now you're stacking up your IBIDA. You have different entry points for the consumable product. Get them all to some form of a subscription. Maybe it's a bundle of the different products that you have that all come together. Put that into the coaching program, run that out a year or two, get some nice numbers, get it on an incline, present it to like a buyer potentially, you know? So something like that could be, you know, I'm with you. I mean, and the focus thing is so funny because it's the opportunity flow that I have right now through this stuff is crazy. And I'm like, I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything. Like, I just keep like repeating in my head. I'm like, oh my goodness. But there's like I'm trying to figure out the frame on that. And really like the the overall thinking of how I'm going about it is like don't touch something like real estate for example that where my learnings will not overlap as much. Like of course anywhere you learn something even how you think was can translate into your main thing. But I'm like, okay, we're info coaching, but if we roll physical product, it's internal. It's not like, oh, I'm going to start up some dog supplement brand, which shout out, I love that business model, but like this is like shiny. This lead gen thing is extremely shiny over here. And I'm like, oh, this lead genen and these paper call guys. I know all these guys. And I'm like, don't touch it. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Because it's not this is except right. So, it's like, okay, the physical products could be inhouse. So, like that pushes the main thing further. and where I have been thinking and you and I talked about this a little bit but like going upstream in info coaching to like that's that's where my frame is going and I don't consider that like oh I sell something like if I'm yeah I've got some like 0 to 10k course and all that kind of stuff which is like not my game uh anyway that I would but like kind of like the port co game kind of like the percent like it's almost agency but it's not because the fulfillment wouldn't be like deploy like full deployment but yeah You and I talked about that. We'll talk about that all because I think there there's a game to be played there that yeah with enough resources and experience in this I think monetized extremely well and super helpful for said port you know example port one stuck at whatever 3 to 500k a month in info it's like there's four levers that I am aware of or area you know they're just leaving on the ground doing some sort of like revshare deal like something like that I don't consider selling or like Yeah, you know, depending. But I don't know. I'm kind of like back and forth. It's like that that to me is also a little shiny object, but I would learn things that are info coaching based so it could apply. I don't know. But yeah, that's super funny on it because Yeah. No, I've had the same exact thought process as you with it. Um, especially with like It's funny you say the real estate thing because that's a conversation I actually recently just had with my partners because, you know, long story short, like we were talking a lot about like investing into real estate. they already had like some stuff in real estate beforehand, but that's something that I kind of was thinking through. I'm like, I don't know if those skill sets, you know, maybe there's some benefits of like, you know, tax deductions and pieces like that that you can translate over, but the the skill set that you're gaining there is a completely different one than what serves the main business. And that's really how I've always tried to think about things. If I ever were to synergize businesses with like the e-commerce stuff, especially like utilizing personal brand. Um, which right now, by the way, like I thought through it and I know we spoke about it. I don't think I'm going to do anything for the foreseeable future to be honest. Probably like next one to two years. I was going to go into it, but I'm like, nah, this is, you know, I have an opportunity right now to take this thing to $100 million a year, I want to say, dialed in there. And you know, again, once once all that plays out, you know, then we see. But like I think for now, just give value for free, build a good audience similar to what you're doing. I think that's that's the play for now. Um, but yeah, no, just on that point, like I think that I've always tried to look at things of how can I create a flywheel from the thing that I'm already doing. So if I were to do it, like the way I would think about it is with the personal brand. This is like my thought process and I'm curious like how you've thought about it on on this line as well. But if I do it and then you know hypothetically could leverage and this is like what Iman does, right? So I'm like this is the same type of model he does where he takes his actual SOPs that he's using to run his main business. He takes the core team that he's paying for his main business. He uses that seuite team plus those SOPs to create now a program that he can now monetize off of the core system that's making his main business run. And then you can extend that to even like softwares like potentially AI that you're using in your business to help you solve a function and then extend that out. So I've always looked at what are the things that I could do in my business to help me drive growth but potentially be able to monetize you know over on that side. But what I've come to the conclusion is that either way it's going to take a shitload of work and will distract you to some capacity most likely. Um so I think with that being said like you have to still focus is like your most valuable asset is how I look at it. So, you have to make sure that you you preserve that at all costs. Yeah, he's done a great job with that and I've talked to him about this a bit and um Yeah. Yeah. Using those resources and but then staying within the lane, right? Like you said, like using the current resources, not really distracting, just kind of going deeper like upstream or however you want to look at it uh within the same. The other thing is the which kind of relates to that is the capacity, right? Because if he has the high level team that can then be the service delivery for that or like a portion of it. I I sometimes wonder that I know we got to pop here soon because we said an hour, but um I sometimes wonder if like we have a lot of horsepower in owners, right? You even said the same thing. You have three different partners that have different skill sets, but like yeah, I sometimes wonder is like, okay, should all three of you or all three of us, for example, be like tripling down in this in our own right plus each other and it's 1 plus 1 plus, you know, 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 15. Or is it that you guys all have half in that still grows it like crazy, but you have your other things outside of it and it's like that's kind of this game of Yeah. And then at what scale do you get to like obviously way larger than where I'm at or you're at or whatever, let's say, but like way larger, but then you have these guys who do get up to the point where they have hold and all that and like that's not even in like the cards really. Like I said, kind of with this like rev share thing, I don't really view that as like a hold co because it's not equity. You're not like deploying team. you're not own them all outright. Like it's not like that. But yes, that's what I sometimes wonder is how much like there's no way we're already going all 100% into this. Like this even right now it's whatever 12:05 for me right now. I have 32 Slack messages since we've been on here and that's my own fault of like my skill set and whatever. And that's not necessarily but you know like this distracts from it but it doesn't. I also learn a bunch of stuff where I'm like okay cool there's overlap. I learn all this stuff. We have access to talent now. while we do all that, but where's the line? Where's the line? No, there's a lot of stuff I want to touch on now with you, like offline specifically. Like there's a few things I want to definitely dive into because I have a lot of thoughts on it. But I think just on that point like I think that's like uh that's also what makes it challenging for sure is when you have the other partners as well and obviously you're doing something and then that can distract you from the main business that you're working on as a whole as a whole and you know if they're not doing the same things like I think that's where it can become a lot of friction and that's also a big reason of why I'm actually holding back on it is I think because of those components as well. Um, but I think that like the way that you're doing it now, for example, and same with me, is, you know, I think posting now, like it doesn't take me that much time. You're doing every day, so I know for you it's probably a bit more, but you know, you've also grown super quickly, which is amazing, bro. But I think doing that obviously then opens up the the door like for me, I've been able to get on like some really highlevel consulting calls as a result of it completely for free because of me putting some stuff out there that now I can directly apply into the business. like what I said earlier, that was something I learned from a consulting call with someone that I met, which was a really valuable insight for me, which changed really my perspective on like the business that I'm building overall. So, I think that you unlock those nuggets by doing it right now, which you wouldn't have access to if you weren't doing it. So, it's like that type of mentorship, which you get access to because you're putting yourself out there, is so much more valuable to the business than the extra hours that you're putting in there. And it's not even you're probably taking hours outside. I'm sure if you're like me, you probably work all your waking hours pretty much. So like yeah, we just like like yeah I'm I'm on 16 hours a day and it's like even if I'm doing two hours over there, like I'll find [ __ ] to do for 14, which is not the most effective method. I very clear that I'm the same, bro. I'm the same. No, nothing. But like we have leverage now through team. So like you don't have to be on like this at all, but I don't know. It's like this morning I was on at 5 and I find these random things in reports and I plug them in channels and then people, you know, like I just like to do it. Uh it's definitely not the cleanest route, but like we talk about like you know some if you had someone in your life that needed you three hours a day because of some medical condition or something like you have the time to do the three hours a day. Like you know you'd make the time and like that's kind of how I look at it is like no matter what I enjoy this so much like these are my hobbies right so it's like how much would someone spend golfing plus this plus work and it's like you just got to combine all in one and it's about it's waking hours you know. No, 100%. Bro, I I look at it the same way. Like I really enjoy the personal brand stuff. Like I love, you know, I I think especially like in our type of position where I think there's le like the reason why I got into the personal branding in the first place is just because I love to yap about business, but there was less people for me to yap too. And I'm just like, you know what? I'm sure a lot of people can gain a lot of value if I just [ __ ] spew for 20 minutes just talk about it. People will get a lot of good insights from it. Plus, you know, all the benefits that will come as a result of it. So like it started really like from a passion first perspective of like I want to talk I want to meet cool people and you know obviously there's so much leverage from a personal brand so you can't ignore all those components but like I feel like that's what makes it like super easy to do. It's not like it's like a frustrating three hours you're putting in. It's like you're enjoying the the time that you're doing it. That is a perfect way to frame that. It's like I move back around like where I'm from and I have my hometown friends that are like you know 15year friends and great dudes crushing it all in their own game but like none of them are in online and like if nothing else I was [ __ ] annoying right like if nothing else I was annoying about how much I like this is all I do so it's all I talk right it's like funny you say that because now it's like I can just sit there and on my phone just like tweet something or like pop in my DMs and I can talk for hours with anything we do these for hours about it so it's ice cuz I talk about it less probably. Yeah, dude. That's not true. I don't talk about it less. Yeah. No, bro. I found myself like talking to my [ __ ] girlfriend about it. She's like, I don't give a [ __ ] about your [ __ ] bro. Same. Cool. You had to do what? Oh, that's amazing. You're onboarding a new whatever. Like, cool. And then I was talking about this and the That's what I knew. That That's when I knew, bro. Yeah. I've got room for the tax pieces and I'm like, "All right, man. Cool. We'll have to do another one that's a little more tactical because a lot of guys like that. These are these are I don't know that mid high level conversation that I like and just get. So, for sure, bro. For sure. Let's do another one, bro. Yeah, let's do another one. So, everyone, what finds you on X and YouTube? Those are the two. Yeah. X ecom moose. It's uh ecom with two M. So, EO M and then Moose on uh X and and Yeah, we got three M's, bro. But two M's in the ecom, bro. We go full out. I love it. Cuz we make it M's, bro. We do. Yeah, exactly. All right, cool. I will I'll have this live by end of day. For sure, bro. Good chatting. Awesome. All right. Be good, bro.

# Veteran Media Buyer Explains How to Make $100K/Day with Pay Per Call
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q7WzSONnX4

What's up, guys? Today's video, we have a heater paper call legend, Carlos. I'm gonna let Carlos kick it off, but today's day 85 of making these videos every single day since I started. So, we are we're on a heater here, too. So, great guest, Carlos. Who are you? What's your online biz journey? Uh, thank you, Ryan. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And to keep it short, I started online, well, I'm going to date myself, but I started online back in 2006, 2007, uh, with a PDF from Perry Marshalls. I was like, you know, the ultimate guy to Google AdSense and ads at the time. And then fast forward to 2018, I came across Paper Call and I've been in the industry ever since. Um, originally I started as a media buyer, a publisher, and then it evolved into a a whole network of paper callers all over the world. Nice. Yeah, I think uh that seems to be like a I don't want to say hot necessarily, but it's like almost still underground in that in that game for newbies at least. Like obviously the the guys that are in it are in it. Um, so what's your I mean what's your stack right now? So you've got a bunch of stuff going on B. Yeah, I see your stuff on Instagram and it's like 3,000 calls today. You got 60 live. You got all this. So, is that So, you guys aren't running yourself now. So, do you guys still do Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. We have an internal media buying team which I lead and we focus on certain verticals that we do very well on. And then we have the network side of things where we, you know, fully vet uh publishers, usually publishers that came into us uh very early in their journey and they stuck around and they learn how we media buy and stuff because we do like coach, not coaching, but masterminds uh weekly and you know, so we're on the same page. They're independent, but we're on the same team, quote unquote, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So is that considered and I'm and I'm pretty new to this game so shut me shut me up or tell me where I'm like wrong but like so is that considered if you're a network right that's very similar to brokering right so you already have correct yeah correct okay so how do you guys solve for because I talked to Nate Anellet and I've I've done stuff on marketing tech side of this like I had some friends when you know prior life where I was doing posts and everything for them back to like ACA direct buyers to all this stuff and so that's why yeah shout out that right but he uh he talked all about brokering and how to set that up. So, how do you handle stuff like cap if you have that much, right? Because I hear this stuff where you get stuck in a in a hole where you can only have x amount of Medicare, you do this or do you guys stay in different lanes? Like what kind of niches? A lot of questions. So a lot of our buyers we develop a you know personal relationship with in the sense that you know usually we start a campaign very small and then over the course of weeks, months and years we develop a relationship. So our cap in the sense is pretty secure because of how we approach it, right? And how we work with our buyers and the kind of relationship that we built that goes, you know, beyond um just calls, right? And that's how we get our, you know, that's how we get, I guess, our cap because we've been working with the same buyers for years and years. Yeah. Interesting. So, for you guys, I mean, I see your stuff. I was, we were talking real quick before this, but dude, I've bought I mean, I I everyone knows on this that listens to this that I buy everything. Like, I'll buy this course, I'll buy this training, I'll buy or just watch, right? So, like you have a ton of YouTube content that's years of stuff, right, that you put out. And then you also have I think I'm even in a Slack channel that you guys have that's like I think you're either network side but a ton of education like a ton of education. So, is that I mean there's obviously tons for free and then there's a little is there like a small pay gateway or uh uh kind of so I'll tell you you know to put it into context and I I spoke this uh before in like other podcasts and stuff like that. But when I first got into paper call I was doing a lot of home services stuff. So I was doing a lot of like you know plumbing water damage and all that stuff. And then a a good friend of mine, she told me, "Hey, you should look into flights." I don't know if you're familiar with that campaign, but it's for people that are looking to book a flight, an airline flight. So, they go online and they call and usually a consolidator will, you know, sell them the ticket like an Expedia or something like that, right? So that's when I I I look into flights and then I remember being outside of my daughter's uh pediatrician office and I was like in my laptop connected to their Wi-Fi cuz it was during co so only one person could go in the office with the mask and the whole n yard. So I was I went into Google uh that's what I started media buying. So, I went into Google and I set up like a a quick um you know flight campaign and I set it live. I totally forgot about it. 3 days later I see that you know I log into Ringbot and I see like hundreds of missed calls and none of them like you know connected to any buyer and it because I only set up like part of the campaign. I didn't do it completely. And you know that campaign was a game changer cuz with that campaign I was able as a single media buyer to like generate my first like mail um in a paper call campaign. And it only took me like 3 4 months to do it. And I was like wow this is pretty good. You know you can generate a million dollars uh running a flight campaign. Uh but I was like you know that's not enough. like I I understand that you know might seem like a lot of money but I was like you know that's that's not enough um how can I do this without being so dependent on my output so that's when we decided to come up with like you know training programs and I created a training for Medicare right and how to generate Medicare calls and stuff like that and then I reach out to a bunch of people that I know I was like hey listen this training out let me know what you think blah blah blah. We started running the campaign. We hit a million dollars within 10 days. I'm like, "Okay, now we're talking. This is more my speed, right? If we collectively do it, then we can definitely ramp it up." And that's when we started focusing on training. I went on onto selling info products, you know, high ticket, you know, $25,000 programs. But if I'm sure I don't know if you've done it before, but if you have it is exhausting. It is like you know it's I don't play that game. We're in the in space but like through the company like not actually me being coach or Okay. Well me doing it I'm telling you like you know being in front of the camera that thing is no joke. But I learned so much. I learned so much from doing it because I was setting up campaigns on a daily basis uh for other people fixing things. So, it's like I was in the gym 24/7 if you put it that way, right? Uh and I did that for like a whole year until I was like, you know, I can't do this anymore. I I I feel very honored that you want to give me such a so much money for my time, but I can't like burning me out. So we decided to make it for free and now it's doing better than ever. So we came up with uh unique 360 uh which is a white label of uh go high level. We just add value to it in the sense that we add you know paper call funnels uh paper call quizzes, chat bots, different landing pages that we use as well as we have a whole creative team that is constantly adding creatives that uh work for paper call for different verticals like you know final expense, Medicare, auto plumbing, you name it. And we have our weekly mastermind. So, I still commit one hour a week to jump in and into our uh masterminds where usually I bring in uh another guest and I'm you've been to some of our calls so you know that how crazy they can get. Yeah. So, that's what I've been up to. It's it's a Yeah, it's amazing. Seems like a lot. Yeah. The the info as like the small small barrier and you know uh Gabe Anel, right? he does his version of this and he has his but then same thing it's like has this backend and it's all the people you meet in there which is huge for your business model but then also you having the monetization method of then them you know being publishers through your and like doing it correct network it's amazing it's amazing you don't need to sell your time for 25k if you can do it on you know autopilot a little uh but we're correct so correct the bigger picture at least for me it's a microtransactions So instead of charging like a a a big amount or upfront cost to learn it, we rather just teach it for free. Like you know like this is the minimum that you're going to that you're going to require in the sense that if you want to jump into paper call or lead generation at the very minimum you're going to need like funnels and landing pages and some type of CRM, some type of automations and text messages or AI voice or you name it. So that's why we, you know, went the route of creating unique 360 so we can add the additional value there and then make it like an irresistible offer for anybody that wants to jump in no matter um you know where they are in their journey or how much capital they have, right? And that's exactly you know what we've been doing and growing it that way. And so far it's working, you know, pretty amazing. I can't complain. It's every day keeps growing and growing and I'm like hell yeah, let's do it. So focusing in the in the microtransactions because the ultimate goal is that we are so transparent and with you and we support you and and in and the journey that eventually we want to earn your trust and when you do decide to do business we will love you know the opportunity to do business with you and that's where the microtransaction comes into play. you know, us either buying or selling you calls. That's where we see the real revenue and the real throats. Yeah, it's amazing. It's It's just this much longer term, right, versus like these like and just thinking that far ahead. I mean, you see the awards back there. We were joking right before this, but I love those. I was like, "Adam, what do I need to do?" And he's like, "What do you mean, what do you need to do? You need to do a million or 10 million or 100?" I'm like, "Okay, fine. Well, I've never run anything, but So that's cool." So that's like really business in a box. So, somebody who has zero idea about paper call can go to this, learn from the ground up, and get all of the funnels, all the automations, the like all you don't need to be on a hay flow. You don't need your own ringbo. You don't need any of that if you're through your stuff. I highly you don't technically no, you don't need it, but I highly recommended that you do get it because as much as I would like to buy all your calls, a reality is that we're not able to do so because of the dynamic of how um call routing works. So, I highly recommend that you have your own account and that you add your own buyers to your distribution. Like the biggest mistake that people make in paper call and at least from my point of view uh or what I've seen it it has nothing to do with the creative or with the funnels themselves. It has a lot to do with the distribution of their calls and their call routing. Uh we can always optimize creative and funnels to have higher conversion rates uh higher CTRs you name it. Uh but a lot of people do not focus on the distribution side on your call routing and then they you usually sign up for one network and have a single buyer run a campaign and be like oh this [ __ ] doesn't work right. Uh, so normally when that happens, I'm like, "Show me how many buyers you have." No, I only have a single buyer. There you go. Right. Interesting. Yeah. So, you know, it's not going to work. So, you are going to need to have, you know, at least I recommend that you have at least, you know, 10 buyers cuz that's going to guarantee that somebody's going to answer the phone call. Yeah. Right. If you're pinging 10 different rooms and 10 different um you know call routings of their you know if you're pinging a network that that network pings all their buyer if you're pinging independent buyers or direct buyers and so forth you have to realize that for every person on the phone you also need one agent on the other side. So that's why you have to stack up your buyers so your call doesn't hit the floor. And in in the case that it does, you want to be your own buyer. And and what do I mean by that? With technology right now, it's pretty easy to set up using like retail AI or Senseflow or similar software. It's very easy to set up an inbound uh call center, right? where if nobody wants to pick up your phone call, you should be the person that is picking up the phone call and then getting consent to reach out to the consumer whether it's on a call back or uh through email or through text messages and be able to monetize that uh instead of just letting it drop and sitting like as a nov value call in your dashboard. So what does what do those softwares specifically do? So, is it like a live call? Is like AI conversation? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Just like an AI uh I don't know if you share stuff in in your calls, but I can share some stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you share whatever you want. Okay, cool. Let me click here this share button. Give me one quick second. You're good. No one's ever shared anything. This is exciting. Uh the gatekeeping. Yeah, we do. Sometimes we're like, "Hey, if you don't want to do, you don't have to dox." But we're all about the numbers, so we're about anything. Yeah. So, um this is like retail AI. So, you can set up here, you know, different AIs, uh with like click and drop, uh type of conversation workflows. Mhm. So, um here you can see that I have a inbound AI, right? That is going to be like, hey, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? so on and so on. Let me show you better than Hello, you are on a recorded line. Thank you for calling the benefit center. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Yes, my name is Carlos Corona. Hi Wing, thanks for that. Just to confirm, do you currently have Medicare Part A and Part B? Uh, yes I do. Great. Wing, can you please confirm your zip code for me? Yes, that's 33130. Thanks, Wing. And um could I also get your cell phone number, please? Uh yeah, that's 954-2478645. Thanks, Wing. Um I also wanted to ask if it's okay to send you occasional updates and promotional messages via text. Yeah, that's fine. Thanks, Wing. Just to finish up, can you please confirm your date of birth for me? As you can see, we collect the full, you know, val there in the lead. So then we can follow up uh you know, either through text message or any other way, right? Yeah. So how do you how do you then monetize those? So you're following up by text to push them back once you have openings on or Yeah. Then then you can monetize it either um through open like you said either through opening um when the call center is open again and you can also monetize it uh through our sock or email or you know Google ads or however else you want to sell it. Interesting. Yeah. So I was on with someone yesterday. They were talking about the hidden economics, right? And like where so many people leave things on the table and that's, you know, as simple as some people splitting their lists and, you know, mailing that way, the data play of being able to do that. But just something that sounds like obvious but clearly isn't for drop calls. Um, that's correct. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was I was in a call yesterday where you know somebody else that I was consulting um and and I was showing him like the numbers of how much revenue we're generating for no value calls for calls that were not picked up that we and then take oursel get consent and then we monetize it um uh thereafter and it was like wow that's daily I'm like yeah that's daily which otherwise it would have gone So like, you know, waste. Yeah. All right. That's insane. Yeah. See, you said a lot of things in there. So, do you talk about numbers? I mean, you show the calls. I have no idea. Like, again, I'm not I'm not privy to this game. I've heard the $18 call. I've heard the 20. Like, you guys are doing like volume, right? Yeah. Yeah. We don't dox those. We just talk about softwares. Um, but yeah, I mean, get the bigger picture. I mean, there's always going to be somebody that is doing a lot more than we are, and there's always somebody that is in the beginning that is trying to do, you know, way more. So, I don't want somebody to like look into the space and see like exactly like what numbers we're doing as like a benchmark. Like, we do like six figure days, right? Yeah. But, you know, like we've been doing this for a while. Yeah. Yeah. When I started, I I started making like $2,000 a week. Yeah. And you know, I had no money at the time. So, I started running and I'm like, "Wow, I'm making like two grand from this paper call," which it was way more than I was making from ecom. Yeah. So, I was like, you know, I'm I'm going to like keep keep, you know, putting time into this and see where it goes. Um, but yeah, I don't know if the IRS is watching, so I'm not talking numbers. Oh, no. No, you're good. You don't talk about anything. No, no, you're good. I can use that for the I can use that for the title. Six figure days call. Um, no, but that's uh another thing you said in there that I I'm sure is in the training, but yeah, the thing that because I'll get selfish of this, right? I have a good domain that's in the insurance space and like I have all of this stuff happening in info coaching and then I just layered on this whole like personal brand thing. It's really just to meet people, network, find talent for our company and like do stuff. Um, and it's taken up a lot of time, but I've always been like, "Oh, I want to do this side quest." And I've worked in the space. I see how scalable it is. I see that there's exit potential because it's like faceless. I see like all these pieces, right? And uh one of the big things people say is like, "Oh, make sure you have traffic before you have buyers, right?" So that's either yourself or someone. But then how do you go out and just, you know, you're getting 10, you just said 10 buyers. Like is that I'm sure that's in your training, but what's the You're a nobody. Like I'm a nobody in this game. like I can leverage some oh hey we've done you know all these sales and info coaching and a lot of people maybe don't know but how do you go find 10 buyers for a specific niche okay so what I'm about to say is probably like very unpopular but whatever um it takes money to set up one of this campaigns so you have to have your initial investment like let's say that you want to go into like fi uh final expense right final expense insurance so you have to have your initial investment where you're going to find your first buyer. And if you don't have a first buyer, Unique is happy to be your first buyer, right? Then you start pushing traffic into your first buyer and then you start collecting your KPIs, right? So you start looking at, you know, what is your cost per sale for your buyer, right? what is the average uh call length like how are they having meaningful conversations right and what kind of volume are you delivering to that buyer once you have that you can take beautiful screenshots censor the information do you don't want to share then you go ahead and you reach out to 10 100 a thousand more people and be like hey I am running my own ads on social media This is what I'm currently doing. Here's some screenshots. And by the way, here's some recordings for for so you can see what's going on, right? Make sure that you edit everything so you don't, you know, you don't share any uh PII, right? So then you send it to the buyers and usually they will reach out back to you be like, "Hey, how can I get some?" Me, I I like to do um you know, a trial if they don't know me. um like you know let's set up a trial and I'll send you like 10 free calls you know I have to pay you for them and some people be like well you're going to be losing money yeah sure upfront but I'm also going to be avoiding headaches because that's going to tell me like what kind of floor are they running like how the agents answer the phone like how well is the script that they're following and so on right so that's going to be either be like I can step in and be like look this is going to work out or this is not going to work out um without having to refund somebody or why not. Usually, it works pretty well. They they you know, if they get um a sale from their from their free trial, then they're on. They're going to be like, "Okay, so tell me more about it. How can I get more calls?" And so on. But that's how I will approach it. I will invest my own money uh to work with a buyer. If you don't have a buyer, like if a plumber, if you don't have a plumber, find a buddy of yours who is a plumber and be like, "Hey, listen. I'm going to send you some calls." like just I need to collect some data so I can go and get bigger fish, right? And run it. Once you have the the numbers, then you go ahead and be like, "Look, this is what I'm generating. Do do you want to give me a chance?" And you know, nine out of 10 they're going to say yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. I have a buddy that does uh that's just like the classic tinkerer. like he's done every little thing you can imagine and like taken all year kind of thing and then always had some like really steady remote job where he just crushes and then he crushes in crypto so it kind of doesn't matter that's like his his true passion but uh his income passion um but he does uh he does Google my business stuff so not you know that version but he is cooking for like months he's sending me these things and he's like you know doing the Google my listing game which is as people know probably like a little difficult to get all of the different properties but now that he has them built up and warm He'll send me screenshots. He's doing five six hundred bucks a day of just like that are from coming from calls. So call your local landscape or your true or whatever. And he routes them to like actual direct places with a network under it if they don't take them. So like basically like two buyer for like localized and he'll do like five six hundred bucks a day and literal profit. Like it's it I mean he has nothing. He's like Google my listing has the phone number. He doesn't even need the Landers. Like it's hilarious. And I'm like yeah it's just there's a lot of ways to make a buck in this game and Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just miss dial calls. If you ever want to do a an exercise, dial 1 800 followed by whatever random seven digits. I can guarantee you that one out of five calls are going to land in a paper call line. And you can do we can do this live. If you can dial 1 800 followed by seven random digits and if I can guarantee you that it's going to hit a paper call line. When did this game become so like I mean phones been around for but like when was paper call like you said 2006 is when you were starting but then 2018 was your paper callish, right? Like so like when did it start getting hot? Like I don't even know the time frame of Ringba or Adam and these guys like I think it started getting hot like it's been around for a while. people has been in the in the in the space since like 2010 through 2012. Okay, that's when all this call tracking platforms came about. I think like 2015 it started to heating up and then like 2018 coming in 2020 is when it really started getting hot and I think now there's so much content out there. you know, Adam from Ringbot putting out a book and all the other people that are crushing their paper call, having this events and stuff like that. So, a lot of people are looking into it like, hm, maybe I should do this cuz at the end of the day, you're running a real business, right? This is not like some type of affiliate play where you're just grabbing link and you're just pushing traffic and you never have to talk to nobody. uh here you actually you know you're building enterprise value and uh quite a few people in the space have exited for you know close to nine figures. Yeah. So it's yeah it's it's unbelievable. I mean I live in info I live in info coaching right where nobody sells you know there's two of them that have sold four of them that have sold whatever supposedly and most of them have reached escape velocity and are no longer only info coaching and that's why they can sell right they get out of it almost they starting it to get out of it um but yeah no I know I know whatever guys that sold for 50 something and something else and it's a great model so with yours though a lot of those guys generally speaking that and please correct me if I'm wrong but like are The simple example that just comes to mind is like a 1800 dentist, right? Where they own that paper call stuff and they go super deep within like one specific vertical, but your example is like the network itself that you're building with multi-vertical, multiple, you know, partners. So, do those sell? Like is that a potential play for what you're going for? Yeah. I mean, is it um cash positive, you know, as far as Yeah, it's a Yeah, anything. So that you'll tell to somebody. Yeah. But have you thought about going deep in one specific ever? Uh yeah. Yeah. We actually built a auto insurance. So we set up an auto insurance. We actually bought into an auto insurance uh agency and we're building deep into that as far as the platform. So, we're able through the through the tech that that we built, we're able to provide you with a real time auto insurance quote after you go through our funnel. So, there you go. And you put in, you know, like your information and whatnot. And then after that, it's like boom, here's like, you know, here's your quote. Then, um, the quote page, we build it in a paper call type of way. So when the person clicks the only thing you can do is call. So they call and it calls into an agency and then we go ahead and you know buy that policy and sell it. So we plan to go deep into that uh as far as like you know from the agency side as well as from the technology side and possibly uh white labeling our solution and you know enable it to other agencies. That's super cool. Yeah, that's what uh Nate on his was talking about because I I again don't really understand this super well. So he was basically saying you know you have simple term but you have media buyer then you have broker sometimes broker broker broker or you know agency and then from sales agency on the back you have uh the actual providers. So in that example he was talking about how they're going to build out a front uh a final expense actual agency. Yeah. So yeah that's like just going upstream. So that's super cool that you guys are then doing that. I'll show you real quick because I'm I'm a visual guy. I'm sure your audience are I'll show visual. So I'm here through the funnel and it says, "Hey, you know, select your car." So let's say that I drive this car and I own it. Had it for one year. Um I don't have any other second car. Let's say I'm single for simplicity and I'm a student. I have a bachelor's and Wow, I can't spell today. And let's say I pay 360. Then what this will do is it will call all the API connections for all the different contracts that we have and it's going to come back with pricing for the consumer. Right? So here you can see that National General, which is an all state company, came back with 212. Here's Progressive, um, Keer, Mercury, and so on, right? And Geico, we put lowest because people always want to call me, "Hey, what's the lowest?" So, but if you hit view here, you can see what kind of coverage it is, and you can see the phone number. So this phone number um once it's connected in the system the agent can see all the information that was input uh previously to get to the call right and they can adjust it you know adjust some of the coverage and why not to to get the best possible coverage for the consumer. So that's what we have been working on doing all the things going deep in this direction going wide in that direction free info just commoditized that's intense. Yeah, right. We got to do everything we can. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, what's your I mean, what's your goal with all this? Like your I mean, I can go in a million directions with this now based on where everywhere you go, but like what's your I mean, is it a number? Is it a Is it just Not really, honestly. My goal is to continue to work with amazing people and do what I like doing. I don't see myself doing anything else. uh I could easily, you know, spend more time into personal development and stuff like that, pick up a hobby and stuff, but at core, I'm always like, you know, a media buyer and I'm always building and always, you know, creating solutions for pain points and why not. So, this is what I actually love doing. I don't have like um an exit strategy in mind or cuz I I think if I sold then I'll be super bored like I'll be like okay so I can't compete like what am I supposed to do? Learn how to fish, you know? So this is my passion and it has been my passion forever. Uh so I see myself buying in media for the foreseeable future. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, let's uh I'm curious on this. So, just like from the start, because generally speaking, you're going to have six figure, seven figure a month guys, but you're always going to have kind of the beginner crew that are going to end up watching. Um, and I love it, right? Like sometimes I get these questions. I do a weekly Q&A and I have everyone submit this thing to a type form and I just rip through every single one of them and it's the context from over here to someone who's doing 600k a month, someone who's like, I just got a computer, right? And it's like I love like the the vastness. So for someone who's literally starting and we can even use my example of it. It's insurance. It could be what do you like the core stack is you can easily get into your thing and have your funnels your page builder right you want your own ring you can have multi buyer but what are you starting when it comes to traffic like what is in your opinion the easiest in or not easiest maybe the the best doesn't necessarily have to be easiest. Facebook works pretty well. Facebook. Yeah. If you know Google then you know some campaigns work pretty well in Google. Uh but if not I would say you know Facebook or Okay. And then when it comes to like niche selection again I come from the info coaching land where it's like basically find something you're as similar with as like that you understand already some capacity and you're also going to go high ticket right because it's like I have the most room for error and you know partner with somebody who's an expert do all that but like how do you do that in lead genen or paper call specific? Uh, it has to do with population sizes. So, the more people that will qualify for your offer or whatever it is that you're promoting, the better. So, I will say that you will stay in insurance whether it's like Medicare insurance, health insurance. Why? Because a lot of times those are subsidized by the government. So, those are pretty big as far as in term of potential uh value. uh if not they're required by the government such as auto insurance or homeowners insurance and why not right uh well not really by the government but they're required right uh so insurance is a big one then I will recommend um financial so like you know credit card debt credit repair um debt settlement student loans and stuff like that not student loan but like credit car and stuff. Yeah, I will definitely recommend those. And home services. The thing with home services is you have to keep in mind that is a very geographical uh type of play because in insurance you can have an agent that is licensed in multiple states either home or in a call center uh helping the client. In the case of roofing, you know, that roofing company is either going to be local or regional. Uh, and they only serve a certain area and stuff like that. So, just keep that in mind. Very is a very good category to be on. And then if you like dealing with [ __ ] then you can go into legal. I was going to say I see the legal guys. I get ads for those that are like But yeah, that's a different game. And we had a media buyer that uh for our stuff for info coaching that was spending like three I always say this number so vast but like that's how she would say it is 200k to 500k like a day and it was across every platform possible and they were doing those like claim cases like uh you know a Tylenol error or whatever error master yeah master. Yeah. So she would do that stuff and it's like that game is just wild to me. Like that is it's completely wild. It's insane. I don't even I don't even understand it. Like the payouts don't even come until XYZ. like what KPI are you using? Like I don't I don't understand. Yeah, that's that's why I don't deal with them. Yeah, it's it's wild because what they're doing is they're building this massive class action lawsuits and so they're ready to burn whatever budget is whether it's 10, 20, 50, 100 million building this case for potential, you know, billion payout. So they will burn like massive amount of money and trying to build these cases, you know. Nuts. It's insane. What do you think about? Yeah. So when you were saying or go ahead No, I was like, you know, we lost saw with the camp leg June. I don't know if you saw like the whole fiasco with cample June. Yeah. Yeah. The What do you think about competition in this though? Right. When you say like because I hear that talk about all the time and like Nate kind of said something. He's like, "Why am I going to have my in-house media buyers?" Well, he's like, "One, there's the conflict of interest where if I'm approving their creatives and then, you know, not running them or I am, you know, that's a gray area thing where it's like you're or not gray, I don't even know where you run the creatives that they basically provided to you inhouse. It's like, okay, you're kind of cutting them at the knees a little." But what about the idea that there are the guys, and you and I, I know some of them, you know, probably all of them, that are all they do is media buy, just the best in the world, literally. And it's like the sh is the share just so big and like the TAM is just there that you can compete with them in auto insurance for example or for Yeah, it's just so big that like everybody can win basically. Pretty much. That's awesome. I mean I I know guys that right now they're doing probably like 300k a day in auto insurance form fills and I it's not hurting me at all. Yeah, that's enough. So yeah, it's it's huge. You know, just look outside your windows, see how many cars you get to see. It's insane. And then you're you're in Michigan, so imagine, you know, exactly. It's everywhere. No, it's I don't I don't really worry or care about competition and competition is always going to be there no matter what business you run. Yeah. In the case of paper call, it's more about compliance. So, you know, yeah, correct. You know, like, can you play by the game and follow the rules? Cuz if you don't, you're I see so many guys that enter the space and, you know, 6 months later they're out because they think this is like the Wild Wild West and they were like, you know, they think they're running a ClickBank off or some stuff like that. I'm like, no, you're not. You're sending calls to a publicly traded company. Like, you got to follow compliance. You got to actually get insurance uh for cyber threats and for EOS and liabilities and stuff like that. You actually are running a legit business. It's you know you're not just an affiliate. Yeah. So at scale, I mean, I'm sure again you teach all this, I keep saying that, but I'm sure you do talk about this, but like at what kind of scale and size, like obviously you want to be compliant from the rip, but like when do you need to start worrying about these next layers? And then kind of on top of that, like obviously your community, but I'm in probably four, three or four of these like affiliate, lead gen, paper call kind of different groups on a Telegram, used to be on Skype, now it's on Teams, like these different ones. Like I feel like this industry of all the ones I've been in is the most I want to say like scattered but also crazy deep. It's like when you find a pocket of these guys, it's like you guys are all like thick as the like everyone knows each other. Everyone knows them by like like it's it's crazy. So like where do you go for that or like to find this that that kind of information I feel like is not like really readily available where it's like oh now you need like you know you need these different insuranceances or hey now and and a great example what you said like I we're in a group chat and I see this guy being like yeah I just can't get anything to work on these form fills like we've been trying for months and like it's off now and like nobody's killing it and some other guy literally responds like five minutes later he's like oh we're doing 200 grand a day with those right now. It's like what? and they're running like the same, you know, niche and offer style, but clearly different. But like where do you find those communities and pockets to learn that stuff? Uh, trade shows. So, yeah. So, like you have like Leads Con, Contact.io, Affiliate Summit, um, East and West, you have Lead Generation World, you know, just just trade shows or the Chandelier Bar, the Cosmo, you know. Yeah. So, you know, you see the same people that are the people that are actually taking it serious and they're doing numbers, they're going to be at the trade shows. And you know, once you once you come across a couple, you know, a couple people and you're genuine, you're keeping it real, you're, you know, you're actually not trying to scam or, you know, do anything shady, then, you know, everybody can make money from with each other because I can either sell to you or or, you know, buy from you or or vice versa. Yeah. So, yeah. And then like uh online like you have like you know the telegram groups uh like I can send you over and add you to more groups you know and telegram and there used to be Skype like all of us used to be in Skype and then that thing went down so everybody move over to like Telegram and why not. Yeah. Yeah. It's hilarious. you go to do I I just remember when I would try to do this a couple years ago. It's like you're going to add an affiliate manager and it's like well ping us on Skype over here and then you get in there and someone else adds you to some group chat and like especially the tech ones are hilarious. It's like now they have their tech support guy, they have the AM and they have you and you have like nine of those and you're like you just constantly played that game. But I wonder you know there used to be uh n someone talked about it but it was like they had warrior forum they had all these like forums back in the day that everyone met uh James Camp was talking about it. He's like I met all these guys on OG internet marketing days. uh on forums and I just find it interesting that there isn't like STM and stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like STM. Um I'm trying to remember the other one. There's a really good one for lead genen like MAD something. But um I don't know what hap like I I just find it interesting. I mean I guess it is more native and easy to just communicate on Telegram because like people are already kind of there. It's quick messages. It's you know but I just find it interesting that there hasn't been one that's come together that has truly centralized everyone again around something like that like I guess forum style I guess. in itself has kind of died. But the ability to have the education, the threads, the long form and the quick like reaction stuff like that versus Telegram. I'll click on that thing and it'll say 312 and I'm like I missed every like unless I have that open. I I'm not going to scroll and like try and miss and these guys are responding to this guy, this guy's doing whatever. It's like I get lost in those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. I mean that's a good one. We have Yeah, we have a Slack and we have a Telegram. Yeah, I mean I Slack and the Slack's pretty good. I like how Slack's structured in general, right? Where you can have that. And I'm in uh I'm in a high paid mastermind that's whatever like 20 something grand. Um and that is a WhatsApp group and I'm also in a Telegram version and they both do that whole like subset channel thing where it's like you talk Yeah, we do that too. Yeah, I like that a lot. We do that. We do that in Telegram. So we have like our general then we have our marketplace. So it's just people like buying and selling and then our support cuz if people and I don't want the general channel to be like clogged up with like you know offers or people asking support then we don't see it and then you know it's a bad user experience. So yeah we have it by topic. Yeah. What do you see as back to selfish but so you're starting out and you're like okay cool I am going to go find a buyer or you're the first buyer and then I go and find some others. I have my couple pages up. I'm ready to go. I start media buying. What is Let's say you're in a position where you're like, "Oh, instead I want to hire this from the beginning." So instead of me being in there media buying, which again, I don't necessarily know that's the right idea. You probably want to have your hands closer to it. You want to feel it. You want to see it before you just like outsource it essentially. But like where I'm at now with things is like I could get a media buyer probably for a percent. I could probably get a creative for a percent or like these creative deals and as could you right now be like I want a media buyer and I want a creative and I want this. I'm gonna build this lean team and I'm not gonna pay you anything off the rip, but when this thing's successful, you guys are all gonna get your like chunk. So, like, who would be the lean team if you wanted to run 20k a day up to you need a for now? You need a medium buyer. Uh, you need a prompt engineer or somebody that is really good at prompting. And you need a solid bisdev. Interesting. And what's the problem without without accounting like you know without accounting and you know stuff like that which I hope that cuz the prompt engineer can can can serve for many things. Prompt engineer can help you with landing page creations, help you with creatives, help you with all the other stuff that you just mentioned. Right. So interesting. That is not what I expected, but I like it and that makes sense to me because now you're gonna Yeah, you're going to hire a creative director, right? Somebody that's going to come up with creatives and stuff like that. I'm like, oh, I'm also going to need a um pages and funnels, right? That's assuming that you decide to take like the hard road instead of, you know, just signing up for unique 360. Shameless plug, but okay. But if if you have a solid prompt engineer, then he he or she can, you know, build all these assets for you. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. My uh my most recent journey of this was some affiliate course. Again, I will buy stuff on a weekend and spend 40 hours and just like eat it alive and test and do stuff. And the last time I did this in this realm where I was doing it myself, like we were doing Windows, me and a buddy that are like local, like I was trying to teach stuff. I don't I was like mind you I don't do this by the way but like I live in this online space but like here's how it works and here's a course that you know I'm in or here's the frame and you know he's spinning it up and he's doing two 300 bucks a day but we're like breaking even on Windows and I ended up getting one of these affiliate courses that was about um Chris Reer actually and I talked to him now. Oh I'm I'm I'm actually um launching a course with him in September. Yeah, dude. He's a savage. A savage. the first we're launching a we're co-creating a paper call course. Does he do paper call now? Uh I do and he does promotions and launches. Okay. A little bit more. Yeah, dude. He's uh he crushes with those like he has insane backend sales. They resell to the same customer like and and with new updated training and stuff, not like in a scam like Yeah, I know. I know. He's legit. That's why we're we're co-creating it. You saw it. Yeah. No. Yeah. He uh he was under uh Kramer and those guys back in the day like when I first met him before he was I I think he might still do some co-branded stuff, but um I got into the I think first variation of that and I had just like moved and whatever and just had all this time. I was like, "Oh, whatever. Two grand, five grand, whatever it was." And uh I get in and the entire thing is literally creative. That's the entire thing is like just make these ads. And I'm like, it's like scripting and then ads. Scripting and then ads. And you're testing the multiple leads out. And you're testing multiple D's and you're doing this whole thing. And the creative process, and this is like prei was so painful to me that I was like, "Oh, I'll just hire it out." And then I'm, you know, a couple thousand bucks here and videos and this and that. And it's like that wasn't the game. The game was just put your head in the laptop and make all the creatives yourself and like do it. And then you're running broad essentially. Uh on Google is how they did it back then when they were doing it. And it's just like those little things I get so hung up on or like and I know other people do where it's like oh like I have to build the pages now and then it's like a week later and it's like oh I'm tinkering with the domain and it's like just do it. But that stuff can be so like in front of your face. So it's cool that you have something like for your stuff when people pop in there and again we don't have to docs like exacts but like there's a reason people go custom eventually or that they choose to in general but like your stuff works. Yeah, I mean like you can pop your stuff up. You can make your own customizations for theme or whatever you want, but like the flows are already built that work and you already have people doing, you know, tens of thousands of dollars a day like through your stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That's so nice. Pretty much I have people that just come in and I'm like, listen, don't complicate it. What is it you want to run? Plumbing. Okay. Like call a plumber nearme.com. That's your domain right there. Buy it or you know call plum plumbing services whatever. Just add call in front of what you're thinking. Buy that domain. Connect it. So here's the funnel. Change the phone number for the phone number that we provided for you and then watch the course on how to media buy plumbing and can you do that? Boom. You're going to do it. You're going to make some mistakes and then you're going to make money. So you're going to have that instant gratification. As soon as you make money, you're like, "Oh yes, this stuff works." Then you're going to get better at it and then you're going to go from there. later on you'll be like, I want to add my own twist to it, my own sauce, whatever you want to call it. But I'm a high like I highly advocate that you get as many buyers as possible because that is the key to success in paper call. If you're running at high volume, you are going to need quite a few buyers. You can't just have one buyer. That that's like that's not going to work. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Not at the beginning. Not at Let me clarify that. Not at the beginning. If you end up, you know, closing a deal with like the select quotes of the world, you know, or a huge company that has five 600 agents, you know, any given moment available to take your calls. That's different. You know, you can probably get by with a huge buyer. Uh but at the beginning you are going to need to get those 10 40man call center uh buyers in the sense right you're going to need a multiple of those because the more that you have uh the better your call distribution is going to be you know because they go on lunch break they don't service certain states you know they're human so yeah yeah we were talking about this um back to the I think it's funny I've heard you talk I've seen these different things you put on YouTube and like you're the guy who always has the like even what you shared already on screen is like those things are don't I don't feel like those are as common at all like oh we now we're going to monetize with this hidden e economic of doing this or we're going to like way I'm I'm trying to remember when this was but like it was early AI you were talking about the voice AI agents like we tried to roll some of those out in info coaching and like didn't make sense because they needed too much context and like it wasn't there yet but like for you guys doing live transfers for example or getting like okay Do you have that like almost the yes no routing very simple like you guys have that o like og days so like are is that you are you just tinkering and you know the people and someone brings it up you find it I tell you like you know just we run a very lean team in the sense and you know I think we're 10 10 nine 10 people and you know three of us are very techy so we're always like sharing like we have this uh Slack channel that is called like cool software and we're always like dropping you know like links of stuff that we come across and then once I see something that makes sense for what we're doing like very early when AI voice I'm like wow we need this so we start like utilizing it and and why not so we trying to stay very you know to the front of what's coming out right and how we can use it to monetize it cuz I sometimes I start thinking like when you log into your Ringbot and you see X amount of calls and then you see like revenue and it says zero no value that's like oh my heart you know what I'm saying why so then you start thinking like well why there's no value well nobody was able to answer the phone call I'm like well But AI, I can answer all those phone calls. But what do I do with them, right? I I don't have somebody to transfer them to. So, best thing I can do is I can get consent and then I can add them to an SMS list and then I can follow up weekly, send them a SMS for whatever they originally call us for, right? And be able to monetize, sell it back to Google in a sense. I don't like selling it as a lead. I don't want them to go somewhere and fill out a form because then they're going to be in somebody else's list and now we're fighting for attention. Right? So, I don't want that. But I will gladly sell it as a click or as another phone call. Right now, all this no value in Ringbot are revenue in a different dashboard. And I like that, you know. So, yeah. And you say that you said this earlier too, but like inside the go high level setup like you are collecting the actual information on these forms and and you're owning the data which is not I don't want to say not super common, but there's a lot of people who don't do that, right? There's a lot of who just run straight and it's like if your ads are off today, like that's it. Like you're not making any money today because you have no data, you have no nothing. So like what is the benefit or draw? I mean, I understand the benefit, but like why wouldn't someone do that other just ease or? Um, first you need to somebody to either explain it to you and show you how to do it and then the know how, right? Cuz if not, they be like, oh, what you're telling me is so dumb. Like, I'm already doing that. I'm like, great, then that's amazing. But some people, like you said, they're not doing it because either they have it hasn't hit them yet or they like they don't think it's possible or they haven't seen any of my videos, I guess. But, uh, right. Um, but everybody should be doing it cuz people call after hours. So, I ran ads today. Somebody took a screenshot of my ad and was like, "Hey, I'm going to call this person after work." And they get off work at 6 and they call. Now, my call center is closed. So I, you know, again, I'm trying to monetize that call. So why would should a call not be connected? Like, let me connect it and let me see how I can monetize you and help the consumer find what they're originally searching for. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Like I know there's the two different models, very simple, but for like the affiliate game, different people do email capture, right? Name email and then push them to something, right? And then the other guys that just like again not bad way but like the that course for example is literally just ad lander and then you're running straight to ClickBank offer that's you know headline VSSL and then nothing CTA time and it's like you don't have ads tomorrow and that was like my experience right is like you get up and you're spending four or 5k a day and all of a sudden something goes off the rails and then you're like everything's off or you lose an account or something and tomorrow you make zero or you lose, right? You still lose. So, yeah, it's never I've never played the data game in this when I've done my random tests and all that kind of stuff. It's always been just like a in the- moment conversion or nothing. Um, so yeah, interesting. It it hit me. Um, good friend of mine, Ron Hart. Shout out to Ron. He uh he's a big data guy, right? You wouldn't think if you saw him, you wouldn't think he's a data guy, but he's a huge data guy, right? And he said something to we were we were talking and stuff like that and he said something to me that is like hit me right. He goes like listen I'm just trying to make $3 to4 per optin per month. Okay. And when when he said that it was like wow cuz that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money right? If you're making three to four dollars per person that opted in every month, you know, and you have like 200 million people in his case, you know, that's cuckoo money. I'm not saying that he's doing that, but that's the goal, right? The goal is is to build your own firstparty data and be able to monetize it. So each optin generates your company, you know, three, four, five bucks a month. I don't want more than that. Just three, four, five bucks a month. If you do that every month, you know, it it compounds on his cuckoo money. That's nuts. Yeah, I've never heard of it framed like that. I mean, I talk about on here sometimes. The very first internet marketing thing I did was essentially build a list, right? Like that was the I bought some I got on a webinar, didn't know it was a webinar, bought a $497 course, and the traffic source was Instagram shoutouts. So, you put a graphic up with link in bio. you paid 200 bucks like DMs and then they would send it to the link and it was some random I don't even remember what it was like bounce or unpaid or something at the time and uh it was optin and then the as the redirect you just put it as a clickbank link that was in the niche that was their whole model and it was like you just selfquidate the cost of what you paid for the shout out but I built this list of like 20,000 people and that was the same model except theirs was a dollar it was like you need to make at least a dollar a month per subscriber and I was such a rookie and there's no AI so I couldn't 80% of the way there with copywriting. Like I didn't know how to do it. I didn't know how to email the list. I didn't know how to do any of that stuff. But like, you know, the number in the affiliate game used to be a buck. They've said it's been lower. But I have heard that you now that you say that, I've heard people say it's two, three, four bucks depending on what vehicles you're using and if or what monetization methods you're using with different form fills, different uh call, you know, going direct to and having those. I hear some of these guys on X talk about like the cact difference of some of these like uh like GLPs and like that kind of game and like there crazy. It's crazy. And same stuff when you start to get into some of the higher ticket like financial services stuff and and different paper call. Yeah, the GLP1s are crazy and it's so easy to put together. Yeah. Like compoundingies everywhere. You can look into like 503 A's or B's and then you get like a doctor network that will do your ecripts and that's it. Run it, baby. Do you do any Do you do any ecom anymore? Uh, no. Um, I still kind of like consult for a gaming share company. So, we used to do a lot of ecom back in the days. Um, and then you know we do like kind of like the gaming chair that you're sitting on. So yeah, but no, not anymore. Yeah. I I just recently when Jason uh Jason A uh started posting about some of his stuff like I guess I didn't realize at the time about his like branded or what's it called? Uh um affiliate ecom. I guess I just didn't even know about that game because that's not super common on some of like the beginner networks at least that I knew of. everything was always either some info product or some like sub supplement through a ClickBank or one of whatever those networks. But that was an interesting model to me too. It's like being able to just create assets for those marketing side of things and be able to run to that and like the economics being how he kind of explained it is super interesting to me. Um yeah, it is. Jason's a great guy. Yeah. I wish I can get him back into paper call. Is he out? Doesn't want Is he out now? No, he's just, you know, it's a love and hate relationship. Yeah, he's been in the chat talking about things for sure. But he's Yeah. Yeah. We had a good run. We had a good run. But, you know, he he does very well with with the stuff that he's running. Dude, he'll message me about something and I'll be like, "What?" Like, he'll ask me a question about this or that and then about because I do the info coaching, call funnels, do you know in house team that it's just like same world but like completely different pockets. Um, and he'll ask me a question. And I'll be like, "For what?" And he'll be like, "Oh, this and this." I'm like, "What do you mean you're involved in that? Cuz aren't you involved in that and that?" And he's like, "Oh, yeah. And that." I'm like, "Dude, I love it." Like, he's just constantly in it. Constantly. It was You have to be delusional and addicted in order to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's definitely With that being said, I really enjoy it, but I got to get ready. I got to jump for another one, I'm sure. So, all right. So, people find you where? I mean, obviously they find with your name. You're everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. just Carlos Corona as you just search Carlos Corona paper call and you can find me everywhere. My YouTube has tons of free content. Uh each of those videos is close to an hour plus when I used to do Moneym Mondays and you have like literally over a 100 hours of free paper call training. No gatekeeping, showing my ad account, showing my funnel, showing everything that's in YouTube. It might be a little outdated, but the same principle applies. um on X. I've recently joined X again and I've been talking [ __ ] and [ __ ] posting non-stop there. So, and on Instagram, uh 305 Shark and then Telegram is Carlos Corona Jr. and reach out. I'm I'm I'm looking to connect with other, you know, affiliate marketers and digital marketers out there and see what we can build together. Yeah, 100%. I cannot echo that more. We didn't get into a ton of tactical stuff on here, but I've watched him and he'll go for an hour straight on anything tactical in any which direction about I would love to. You do. You already do. I would love to. But but I literally have to get ready to No, no, you're good. You're good. You're good. All right. Well, I'll talk to you. All right. We We need a part two. How about that? We need a part two where we just eat something alive. We launch one from scratch and then we just watch it live. Let's do it. Let's Let's do something live. I'm down. I got the domain. All right. Let's do it. Cool. Thank you so much. All right. Bye. price.

# $17M+ in Direct Response Sales Explained in 3.5 Hours | EP84
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Csj7ZLZVA

What's up, guys? In today's video, we have Julius. This is a highly, highly recommended and sought after episode, so I'm excited to get this one on here. Julius, who are you? Uh, my name is Julius. I am a marketer, copywriter, sales guy, all things how to sell to people. Uh, right now I am working on scaling a funding brokerage. Uh, right now I was in credit repair. before that. We're still doing something right there in terms of like offers that I've run. My background more so is in actually working within companies. So, I'm really kind of new to this whole like operator thing, which is why I absolutely loved your channel. Like I found it, my business partner actually sent it to me first. I was like, "Yo, like you need to watch this guy." And so, I've been uh the one video that you had about like hiring, tracking people, like the KPIs, all that stuff just really good because I'm new to actually operating. In terms of selling, I've been in SAS. I was head of product. um product growth for SAS company, ventureback SAS company over in Europe. I was in an agency. I handled all the accounts, did all the marketing. We're managing like up to like a million dollars a month in budget there, which if you know anything about Europe, that's a lot over there. Here it's like almost nothing, right? But over there, it's a lot. Um did some lead genen stuff like fractional consulting on the side. uh worked in info lead genen again like every vertical like from local to final expense which for all my paper call guys I'm gonna have some sauce for you guys later uh all that stuff um coaching a lot of uh a lot of like low ticket info products so I actually started in like dating I'll get into that as well like writing copy for dating offers I was mostly front end like almost all front end so like all the copy all the ad creatives like stuff like that is the media buying as well the media buying side was more on the agency And like I just I wrote the copy and then I noticed that all the media buyers were like kind of like botching the accounts and stuff like that. I was like, "Yo, my copy is so good. Uh like you guys need to push this correctly." So I just went on there and I actually learned how to do media buying just so that I could have full control over all that. And I got so good I just took over from them. And then that's where I actually I learned the skill set of media buying as well alongside the copy and the messaging all that stuff. So rounding out had to learn how to manage and ramp a sales team which was new to me still new to me terrifying it was like I was like how I don't know how to you know but um just rounding out my skill set there and now you know operations is still like my my biggest weakness and even on Twitter I say this stuff like I know some things this is all my opinion none of this is hard truth because if there's one thing that I've learned is that there's a million ways to do something it's just the way that I've done it like everything that I talk about is the way I've done a test that's actually worked. So, yeah, that's just about me. 100%. Dude, I say the same thing. It is these are all opinions or things that we've done, right? That's the beauty of this is whether it worked or didn't work. And I'm happy to share that uh what we're currently doing. So, you were the first one. Oh, you need you need a number. I'm sorry. You need a number. I I like wrote this down in my notes. I was like, wait, he needs an actual number. And it's so hard because I've been in so many. Okay. for for businesses that I've been in where I've had a actual impact on the front end in terms of sales like as that I've written you know messaging that I've done or media buying that I've done the numbers around 17 million in terms of revenue generated not all me that was not all mess okay I was just a guy on the front was like actually writing the copy and all that stuff so I I know I had to give you a number and I had to like kind of like pull like I usually just pull one from somewhere random and then people hate on yeah literally yeah I'll take it I'll take 17. He fully did everything and it was a whole Yeah. Um All right, cool. You were the first one ever to put me on. So, context for everyone who's listening. Uh I had probably two 300 subscribers on and I was making a video a day. I was probably 35 days into doing so. And uh Julius was in my DMs on Instagram and we were going back and forth and he was asking some questions. I was asking some questions and I was out on a golf course and he's like, "I'm going to put you on." And I was like, "I didn't even have X on my phone." And all of a sudden I'm like seeing these charts go like this. I'm like, "What's going and he tweeted and literally next day it's like 3,000 on YouTube, 3,000 on X. So forever indebted to the initial Kickstart. I appreciate it. But dude, so welld deserved. So welld deserved, man. Genuinely like your content is insane. Insane. So well that I appreciate that. I'm going to be glazing this episode. Today is all about you. So we're going to learn this. So you pull questions. I'm going to put X directly next to this right here. But you have perfect 29 questions on this sheet that came from X from everyone. and we're going to start on the top and then you and I'll bounce back and forth. But first one that keen to hear how you approach hooks based on the awareness of the audience. So hooks that convert for cold versus hooks for people in lower in the funnel. So top of funnel versus bottom of funnel awareness levels. How do you do it? Okay, it's funny the question kind of answers itself a little bit. If you're aware enough that based off of your based off of your marketing right now, I have ran x amount through cold. I'm seeing like people are coming in that are, you know, unaware of the problem or problem aware or something like that. You have a top offunnel channel and top offunnel messaging that's like working that's converting. You're kind of already halfway there because you can kind of tell based off of the split testing on the front end like where people So the way that I structure my creative tests, so I have my CBR, AB, whatever I do and I have really good naming conventions for my actual like adsets. So I will sometimes test awareness levels of the actual market that I want to go for in my cold prospect cold prospecting campaigns. A lot of people do that. Cold prospecting campaign retargeting campaign. I'm shifting away slowly but surely from retargeting campaigns because Facebook does a lot of retargeting. You can like see just go through like your frequency, your 7day, whatever. And there's ways to actually like set that up. Like you can see that Facebook does a lot of retargeting for you. A lot of the media buyers on the ecom DTOC side of Twitter will tell you that too. They've kind of stopped running retargeting campaigns. And so I will split test awareness levels in my adsets for my cold prospecting. So I'll go for problem unaware. This is like where my indirect leads come from. So like I share a lot on Twitter about like writing indirect messaging. And so that's where that'll come in. And then I'll have my solution aware, right? Or perceived solution aware, right? And so there I'll be like very heavily mechanistic copy. And then I'll have my problem aware right there. There's like your everyone almost everyone operates in the problem aware space. Almost everyone does problem aare messaging which I think is something that needs to change which we'll get into. But in terms of like the hooks, there was a guy Mark uh Puscetti. He has this thing called awareness positioning and I love it. He's like your awareness positioning is your hook. So it's like where you sit in the spectrum of like what the market is aware of in terms of your solution or their problem. That is your hook right there. Right? And so oftentimes this comes to everyone does like the desire thing, right? Like, oh, want to do XYZ, right? And then maybe they'll add a modifier like without ABC or something like that. That's like the most You hate one, two, three. Yeah. Yes. Like that's the most common type of hook that at least I see a lot of the times. What I like to do, my favorite kind of hook is catalyst hooks. These are my favorite now. And so I'm learning this a lot from affiliates. Affiliates are great people to swipe ads, like fantastic people to swipe ads from affiliates. They love their catalyst. So, let's say um someone in Florida, let's say it's a guy running a uh I don't know, let's an insurance ad, right? An insurance affiliate and they target by state, right? Because the coverage. So, let's say it's like they're running to Florida, right? I live in Florida. I'm going to see an ad and it says, "Florid residents now have the opportunity to do whatever because of either this new law or this new tool or this new system, whatever." When I was in MVA, we did a lot of that. Yeah. Right. These are my favorite now because in these as a market gets like more and as an auction gets noisier and noisier, everyone like people become claim resistant. It's like the banner blindness, right? Right? It's like they they hear a claim, they hear a thing. It's like it's because people are scrolling all the time. They see all these ads. And so you need to even justify why the thing is happening, right? And so it's because of this thing right here. Now you can do XYZ. Because of this new financing plan, you can get a roof for 59 bucks a month. I get hit by those like every day, dude. Right. And so that's my like every day. That's my new favorite kind of hook to run now. And I'm testing this like aggressively across offers, even the funding stuff, even like the B2B stuff. It works really, really well. Yeah, that's that's what I was going to ask. So that works across. Yeah, because what you said Yeah. So what you said so far, so I mean Yeah. And again for everyone here, like I this is not as much my speed. I'm going to ask questions this entire time. Like I exist more on economics of this and understanding overall strategy than I do like hook versus like you I mean all of that. But I I have a concept of this. So I'll try to navigate this as best as possible. But so when you're talking about those awareness levels and an example for what we see is for our low ticket right now the it's almost acting as a retargeting asset more than a cold asset and that's because the awareness level the mechanism is like in the middle right more so than it is up here. It's not really like broad cold friendly to where it's the seven days in two second you know like all that kind of stuff. It's not built for that. Um so we're going through that but question I have for this top section because yes you can test based on these three buckets of what you were saying right on awareness level but within the top how are you testing across the top section of you know what I mean like like problemishaw aware right so problem solution product how are you doing it in there on the top layer so let's say we're talking about problem aware right so let's say we have just the just the buckets that's problem aware when someone's problem aware and I'm going to get into mechanisms and I was going to leave this for later because I had a question that I wanted to talk about this but we'll I'll I'll start it here and then I'll go more in depth there. Uh Stefan Georgu I think he popularized the idea of the unique problem mechanism. I'm pretty sure he popularized that concept. I know it's been talked about before um but I'm sure that he popularized that concept. And so for people who are problem aware, it's very important that you tell them why they're having the problem in the first place. So everyone knows like agitate the problem, right? You also have to explain why that problem is there. And so for example, you were talking about this in one of your podcasts, the prebiotic ad. Someone mentioned I forgot who the who the guy was, but you're Yeah. Yeah. the prebiotics, right? Yeah. And so prebiotic, first of all, let's say I'm let's say I'm selling like a gut health supplement. Okay, cool. unaware. Oh, uh, my gut health is a thing. What's a gut health? Right. I didn't even know that was a thing. Problem aware. Okay, it's my gut health now, right? I know that I have a gut health problem. Why do I have a gut health problem? What is this? Right? Then the ad goes into the VSSL goes into this thing of the prebiotic. That's the solution mechanism. But the problem mechanism is that you don't have this prebiotic in your system. You need this thing because of and then you go into the justifier loops, right? Right? And this is where the unique problem mechanism sits. Your uh I don't know anything about biology. I'm about to embarrass myself. Your gut microbiome doesn't have enough thing to feed on. And so this leads to this this this this, right? And so if you want to that's in like a BSL or sales level, you want to condense that into a hook. It's very very simple. You say if you've been struggling with this, right? you can do something here like stop doing and then perceived solutions to the thing because everyone who's in a problem aware market they've looked at other solutions right or they've heard other messages they they like think they know what to do right so the easiest simplest way to do this stop um stop doing stop taking what's a gut health supplement do I don't take supplements I don't know what's a what's a gut some like what some like gut health supplement we can stay on the we can stay on Craig Clemens it's we're down the same path here we'll stay on Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, stop taking these supplements. Stop working out. Stop drinking water. Stop I don't know sleeping, right? Like whatever people think that I don't know like whatever people think is the solution to that. Just like diss all of those, right? And then be like the actual problem is your gut doesn't have prebiotics and then you can go like write better copy for this so that your gut can do XYZ and then you can go into the solution. Right. Got it. for unaware. Well, yeah, let's say unaware. I feel like unaware is such like a vague thing because people are oftent times they're aware that like something's wrong. I think um Albert um he he categorized this as like people have this feeling, this energy that's like something's not right. Right. And that's like usually where the unaware market sits. For unaware, it's the easiest thing in the world because you just tell them something that they haven't heard before. Yeah. It's the easiest thing in the world. problem aware is I think the hardest and then solution aware is the easiest because is is easier because solution aware you just go into mechanistic copy right reason why all right as O Gilby says it right and so that's how I would structure the hooks that's the simplest way to do it if I know nothing about your offer nothing about your like your formulation that's the easiest way to do it yeah I uh only time I ever had any direct experience like real real was when uh I was doing some of Chris Reer stuff like I bought on his courses one time and they do like really really mass volume affiliate stuff. Um, so they're like super affiliates. They use YouTube ads, but everything was around that hook and like basically the the shift right there. And you're going pretty broad with his stuff, but he crushes that. So, uh, let's move through these because we have 29. And uh yes, we're going to see where uh number two on here is if if you're trying to scale a DD DTOC high ticket brand that's in a niche that's mostly commoditized, for example, saunas, how would you go about considering it not an impulse buy, funnels, positioning, mechanism, ads, VSSL? What's the overall strategy? So overall strategy is how are you taking something that's commoditized like a sauna? Yeah. And building it out to be something that you would do, you know, DDC direct response with. I assume is what he means by this instead of just brand. Yeah. So, one of our in terms of like actual like markups like how like the the funnel structure and the channel and then all that stuff. Um, we had a furniture brand as a client like back in the agency. Um, and this is going to be a very unsexy answer. It was as simple as longtail Google Google uh keyword ads and then some SEO on the back end. Um, and then we had a blog which was just like furniture styling blog. So, it was we just ramped up a bunch of keywords. So, like here's how to style XYZ, here's how to do this, right? Here's how to uh have your dream living room, what your dream living room looks like, right? And then like we had like a bunch of inspo stuff like that. It would go off to Pinterest as well because we had a social media manager would go off to Pinterest. They'd create boards that backlink back, right? So, in terms of like markups like that messaging now, let's go into the messaging. And that's the only experience that I have with like any high ticket ecom like I don't I don't like to touch commoditized stuff. I really don't. I'm selfish and I'm lazy. I like to go for stuff where I have some kind of arbitrage opportunity in the demand genen. That's where I like to operate. Um, but if I was doing this in terms of messaging, there's the easiest way, which is just go upscale, go up market, right? Like basically 5x your price point, take some really sexy pictures, right? Like that's like literally the easiest way to do it. Like I've seen people do that where it's like the same literally the same exact product. They just mark up the price, really really beautiful branding, all that stuff. maybe do some influencer [ __ ] right? Um, that's the way I've seen people do that. But if you want to talk about how to sell something that's commoditized, let's get This is the This is the mechanism question. So, this is not from me. I have to make that very clear. It's from a YouTube channel called Copy Squad. Highly recommend following them, watching their video on how unique mechanisms work. This does all the heavy lifting. Highly recommend that. So in this case, if I was selling something commoditized, you have a few kinds of mechanisms because I want to go into the mechanism because I truly believe that this is the single most important part in copywriting that everyone neglects. And I'll go into that a little bit deeper. Let's say I'm selling something commoditized. There's a very uh there's a very famous example here from the show Mad Men. They're selling cigarettes. Guess what? Very commoditized. Everyone's selling the same exact [ __ ] right? And so Don in the show, he was asking the CEO like, "What's different about your thing? What's different? What's different? Like how do you how do you make this thing?" He was like, "Well, I mean, we use the same ingredients that everyone else does, the same process, like everything like that." And he was like, "Okay, walk me through it." He's like, "Oh, well, well, we toast our cigarette, our tobacco." And he's like, "You toast it." I like, "Yeah, but everyone toast it." And he was like, "Who says that they toast it?" And I was like, well, and so now he was like, our cigarettes, they're toasted. That is an unspoken mechanism. That is something that everyone does if you're in a commodity market. It's something that is a part of everyone's process or product or service or whatever, right? But no one talks about it and you just highlight that and now that is your thing. Another example, another example of this, let me open up here because I had the examples written down. goldplated uh detectors, smoke detectors. And so there was another this is from uh Joseph Sugarman. So he was selling fire detectors, right? And the same thing like, okay, what does everyone what does everyone use? I was like, well, we have a goldplated like detector. And he was like, does everyone else have it too? Like, yeah. Does everyone talk about it? No. Goldplated. That's it's it's so stupid. It's so dumb. But that thing positioned them in front of everyone else in the market and now their competitors are looking at that they're like what the [ __ ] like I I'm goldplated like he's toast doesn't matter because they were first to that. So if I was selling something that's commoditized let's say let's say a piece of furniture let's say it's wooden furniture wood and let's say it's high quality right? What kind of grain is used in the wood? What kind of what does the grain pattern look like? What kind of wood are you using? Where's the wood from? Is it imported? Is it European? These are like some things like if it's imported, it's usually always perceived as a little bit higher value, right? Like is it imported? Like what does it look like? What do you use to assemble the thing? Why is it sturdy? Right? You can look at a bunch of different things there and just look at literally what's in your process. You'd be shocked at how many things that are in your process, in your product, in your service that you are not highlighting in your messaging. And if you find that one that could be like your big idea, some people call it big idea. I just call it like the actual like unspoken mechanism that could absolutely change everything and now that's your positioning. Yeah. So that's how I would sell something commoditized like that. Yeah. And you and so you're saying though that even though that is commoditized even though that everyone has that because you're first to market you win on it because you're first to position like that. Interesting. Yes. First to position. Exactly. Correct. Yeah. And so if you have something like let's say we do the wood grain thing like oh everyone talks about their wood grain thing or it's like um let's say it's the I don't know it's like the bolt pattern because everyone says don't sell on features. Everyone says this don't sell on features sell on benefits. It's toasted as a feature, but it positioned Lucky Strikes as like the top selling cigarette brand in the world, right? Every like goldplated as a feature and yet it outsold every other smoke detector on the market by like 10x because they use the mechanism in the right way. Yeah. Interesting. So there is a point where you do have to use your features. There is a point, right? And so that's how I would do that, right? Again, look at everyone that's in your market. Do some really good like market analysis. Obviously, make sure that you do have something unique and highlight it. Like really highlight it, right? Don't just have it in your bullets, in your copy, under your description. Highlight it. Put it in your headline. Put it in your ads. Right? That's how I would do something like that. Oh, the sauce is going to get real. Number three on here. That's super. I'm like thinking that for our stuff, and I'm sure I'll talk to you offline about this, but I'm like, "Oh, there's some very obvious ones for our stuff." That's like, oh, hell. Um, yeah. Um, all right. You talked to us about create uh creativity and ideiation in copy. I read one of your landing pages a while back and that [ __ ] was good AF. So your creativity and ideation process for copy. Okay. I wish I could give I wish I could give people a structure. Um I really wish I could give you like a set of like like a formula checklist to go by and be like okay so this is there and this is there and this is there. I don't have that. A lot of this at this point is just intuition because like I've written just I've just written so many sales letters. I've been in these markets. Like I've seen how the biggest people operate. Like it's just intuition at this point and like I've done so many split tests on like different structures and formulas. Like okay here's let's say I'm writing a brand new sales letter and let's say I'll use the business funding. Actually I'll dox I'll dox it. I I'll dox my I'll dox my uh my my kind of like awareness positioning here and it's okay because you can copy me but you can't copy the reason why I do something. So we're selling business we're selling business loans, right? Everyone sells business business loans. Um I'm going to do a modifier mechanism here. So I'm looking at the market. What does everyone say? What is everyone selling? Selling loans capital. Some smart people are selling growth capital, right? Some some smart people position it as growth capital, right? And so I'm looking at this, I'm like, okay, what do people believe? What is the belief that people have about the thing that I'm selling? I would start there. Well, no, start with your market research, your basic market research, of course, first have the fundamentals, but then start with what do people perceive about the thing that I'm selling, right? What beliefs do they have? What limiting beliefs do they have about the thing, right? And what are the perceived solutions around the thing? So, everyone around business loans believes that you need a bunch of collateral, right? You need a perfect like credit score if you want to get like I don't know um lines of credit or like 0% interest credit cards like whatever something like that, right? Um people believe that it's a hard process that it takes a long time, right? People believe all these things. So, okay, those are all my negative beliefs around the thing. Okay, how can I flip that? And I'm going to give you an example from a sales letter that I wrote about marketing. So this was in a segment targeting a niche that I had never heard of the term attraction marketing before because and so I was like looking like okay everyone's selling everyone thinks that it's hard people hate ads. People do all this stuff and you try to sell Facebook advertising it doesn't work because everything's saturated. Everything's noisy. No one's buying anymore. The auctions are too expensive. Blah blah blah. How do I flip that into a positive? Attraction marketing. I'm not bothering people, I'm attracting them, right? And so I wrote that sales letter. It did really well. I had to look at the market and like what people believe around the thing. And so let's say I'm doing that for business loans. Okay, what if there was something that where I could add some exclusivity into there where I was like, hm, I can get you approved for XYZ very fast, the best terms, right? Everyone says that. How now? How can I do that? What if I told you that I'd h I had some insider relationships? This is really funny because this is the this is the unspoken thing. Everyone does. Everyone does, right? No one's talking about it. So, I'm going to use this angle at from like insider reps, right? Relationship funding, right? Insider banking relationships. Okay, now we're getting a little bit interesting now. Now it's getting saucy. Okay? Because now all of a sudden from that from that now I can paint now I can further differentiate myself. I can say I'm going to get you these great terms right I'm going to get you like this great capital allocation right because I have these insider relationships and now I can go into hero's journey. How did I get that right? Why does this matter? Right? And I can kind of now that I just have that I can branch out and I can structure I can kind of create all these other elements in the copy. Yeah. That's so interesting. Like Yeah. Yeah. That's so interesting. I mean, continue, but yeah, continue. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Because copy like if you're writing a a VSSL, right? Like or you're writing a landing page, it's like all structure, right? Like you have your open, you have your lead, your lead type, you have like your your hero's journey, you have your need problem mechanism, your like solution mechanism, you have your offer, and you have your close, right? It's always easiest to go from bottom up. This is something that Allan talks about a lot, right? I didn't even realize I was doing it was like bottom up. So always close, offer and heroes and then you just go up the cycle, right? But I found that a lot of the times if you go mechanism first, the rest kind of falls into place. Mh. Because what a lot of people don't realize when they're writing copy, if you sit there and you're writing a sales letter, you're typing out a sales letter and like you have all these elements like you have your little check box. I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. And so you write it all out and then you read it and you're like, damn, it's clunky. This is really [ __ ] clunky. Why is it so clunky? And it's because you have not established a series of ideas that the prospect has to agree with first. Right? Because we forget a lot of the times that copywriting is writing. You have to write well. And the way that you write well is by expanding on an idea and then summarizing the idea and creating an open loop to another idea. Right? That's the way that you have to do it. And if you start with the mechanism, if you start with what you're doing, how you're doing, why you're doing it, a lot of the times the rest falls into place. And so to answer the question of very roundabout way, that's how I get like kind of creative or idea in copy. Another way, if you just want like really really tactical, like let's say you're scripting ads, like you have an ecom brand, whatever, and you're trying to script ads, dude, go into a market that's completely unrelated to your thing. If you're if you're in D TOC right now and like you're in ads library and like you're looking at all these direct response offers, go look at info. Look at info. All right. Like open up, dude. Open up MSNBC. Scroll down to the to the to to where everyone has the um uh those what are they called, man? Um the ads there that are that are on the page. Yes, thank you. Native. Jesus Christ. All the native ads, right? Look at those. Look at the headlines, right? Look at the images. Look at those. Look at different channels, right? Because for native they have to click. Like that's their whole thing is like if they have to the the headline has to be good enough for them to click through. Get your ideas from there. Like I have a massive swipe file purely from native ads, right? Interesting. And so go always like if you're just too entrenched, sometimes you're just too in your thing. You're too like you just need to get creative. You need to like take a bird's eye view. Look at other niches. Look at other channels. Other channels is huge, right? And get some inspiration from there. Yeah. No, that's super helpful. I mean, sorry if I cut you off in the middle there. Our video gets choppy, so no one knows comments because I cut you off. Um, but no, that's uh No, it's all good. Extremely interesting because you do have a process, right? You do have a process and it's like it does come as intuition now for how you do it. But before we get to the next one, just offbeat a little bit, but like where where's the highest leverage opportunity that you could be applying this? Cuz like again, I'm not super well versed in this land, but like it sounds like you really know your zone of genius in this. Like is it like an agora? Is it like uh you know one of those because it sounds like you've done a lot of things which I think like that that's kind of my model too is like I did a lot of things before we did this one big thing or whatever that's just you know big in terms of size compared to the other ones if nothing else. um helped me like skill stack for sure, but I definitely could have taken one further. And it sounds like you're taking a lot of these like this. And so is this like funding thing? Is that one have the return potential for you for this skill that's like really high in comparison to the other ones? And like is there a higher like where's your journey looking like for that? That's a good question. Um I think part of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it is a kind of a byproduct of my negative heristic. So, I've always kind of done this like like I've always been around in like every industry and just like playing around like getting a client there and then scaling one then in the agency we never niched down. We had everybody like literally any do you sell something? Cool. You're a client. And the wild thing is that it worked. It's the wild thing is that we actually got results. And so I've been in all these different industries. The reason why if you're a copyriter and you have like that skill set and that's what you want to operate in and that's the only thing that you want to operate in then yeah 100% go apply for an Agora like a copyrighting position at Agora right like work your way way up to copy chief right like maybe you can be like a CMO for like one offer right I think at a certain point I've fallen out of love with info I won't lie um part of it comes from I I had when I was doing like my freelance thing I I had a bunch of coaching clients and info clients um two years ago who are working a job now like it seems to be so much of the case like we can point to several big guys who've stayed who have longevity but like let's look at those a bit deeper Tai bro he launches 10 offers a week right like and like every every [ __ ] week it's something new he has to right like Grant oh my like Grant's is very like my god the operation he's built is insane. But he has his 10x ventures. He has his 10x like for the for the local stuff. He has his like internal like capital raising thing like the real estate like all that stuff. He he has to do a million things at once. He has to do the seminars. He has to do these things, right? And I think at this point now seeing all of this I'm looking at industries that can stand the test of time. People need money and they will always need money. I've seen this industry. It's very unsophisticated in terms of how they generate pipeline. Everyone like MCA like MCA shops have floors, massive floors, right? Line of credit guys rely on referrals, right? If I can go in and run paid ads, which I have, um I was getting like $15 cost per qualified leads from business owners who are making $150,000 a month. Pretty solid if I have that skill set. Like, oh, okay. [ __ ] All right. Right. That's the key. And that's what I that's what I've been talking about too on this. Like I'm going to get you to re fall in love with info because it is it's the it's the broken part of info, right? Or not the broken part, that's that's that's crude. But the it's the coach to coach to coach side. It's that like you do it. You take your skill set and whether you call it direct response or copywriting or the the info business and coaching model in itself, you can look all the way down the funnel or the whole model and if you apply it to an industry that's not internet marketing or like make money online or whatever. It is so beautiful and so simple in itself, right? you don't have this business operation that you know funding for example that has which I'm not which there's no disc but like you know it has way more moving parts and it has like it's real business not an offer and like 99% of info businesses are offers or multiple offers that becomes a brand that has like you said all the offers versus the ones that can stand the test of time that can start maybe as info coaching and transition into something that still in itself the model is you're selling info or coaching and this is no [ __ ] on MMO this is no [ __ ] on like we're in, you know, I'm in talks right now of how to do this in a way that I feel is clean that's like a way to cherrypick essentially the ones that I think are like real like businesses and have opportunity like legs. But you're so right, like taking the skill set and applying it to a little vegan company or I use the example I hear all the time of the guy who applied the skill set to his mom who had a knitting blog or like YouTube channel and next now they've gone to this and they do like whatever I don't want to misquote but like hundreds of millions a year with this knitting thing and have an entire town that they're from in the middle of nowhere that people travel to because it's the knitting capital of the US and it's like you can take these ideas so much further and she was selling essentially there's e-com and physical products, but like that was the evolution. It was her talking about knitting, then it was like, you know, like it's crazy. So, it's I think I think you're right. I think it's the skill set. And now that's what I was kind of asking is like where's the highest leverage for that skill set and it sounds like you've stacked a lot of the skills in that realm of like DR and like that game, which you only get through doing it in all these different buckets. But like yeah, like hopefully you have and we don't have to dox your your setup with those guys, but like hopefully you have a meaningful size of that because what you're doing I do is a huge lever. Yeah, a huge lever. Yeah, I I won't I won't go into um I won't go into specifics because that absolutely could do. Yeah, you don't need to. Yeah, I I I will say that we have one of the best terms with our originators in the market, at least of people that I've spoken to in this industry. And so we want to talk about like economics, right? Because you love economics. So tell me what you think about this. Um there are a few ways to to obviously to to grow the business. I can cut kak in half, right? For example, like I can like me as a marketer, right? I'm a marketing guy. So I can cut CAC in half, whatever, blah blah blah. If I see that in an industry like, okay, I have to stay within XYZ CAC and like my sales cycle is this and then blah blah blah this and so my clos rate has to be or or since I'm a brokerage and I get a commission on the allocations, I can just have a 40% higher allocation as my commission than everyone else in the industry. And now I have so much more to play with on the CAC side because of that. And so I can kind of like not that I'm going to like mess around, but I can kind of mess around and not be perfect on the acquisition side and have some some, you know, leeway to play with. I can do that, right? And so that's how I've kind of played this out. Like if you look at a lot of MCA shops right now especially like they give their reps 50% commissions sometimes right on their 10%. Right? 60 we don't do that. I'm not going to dox exactly how much we give in like a comp plan and like in the structure like all that stuff but we don't do that right we have a model that is very very healthy for us on the P&L side and the reps love it too because they don't have to outbound dial. they don't have to hear like [ __ ] you like you know blah blah blah all day right and so I can play around there and so I'm looking at that I don't know if that's the right framework I would love to hear your thoughts on that because again I'm not I'm so new to operating dude so new to operating like we scaled just like internally like we we got the funding offer to uh 50,000 just topline uh in 27 days off of like basically no ad spend like the returns were insane um but we have a couple offers I can walk I can walk us through like later I can walk us through like offer stack and like where we're liquidating like what our monetization is. I can we can we can walk through that. We can walk through that later but I want to hear your thoughts on that. No. Yeah. I mean I don't know enough about the space just off the rip. So this is like opinion only but as long as because lead lead quality and the ease in which or the efficiency that someone can do their role. It's like the path to money, right? It's like if you have a rep that's making 20% versus a rep like we're talking high ticket sales. You have a rep like a very there's a perfect example inside the info whatever space they have mercenaries they call them. So it's somebody so your normal your normal sales rep super simple and like basically classic is 10%. Let's just say that's like very very common in the space is 10 and then maybe like thresholds or they get up in cash collected amounts and then they reach 10 to 12%. That's like around the range. There are reps that are 20 25% that you hire on that you don't feed at all. So they're essentially a full stack mercenary and they pull people from the CRM. And this is better for guys who don't have like full machines where they have setters already doing this and all that, but like like this would have been perfect for us back six months ago and I didn't even know it existed. And I've talked to someone since that that was talking about this and they're like, "Yeah, they'll pull three, five, 10 deals a week depending on the warmth of the leads for sure." But like they get 20 points on that because you would have never had them or you would have hoped that they saw, you know, a retargeting or an email or something and pulled themselves back in. But these people were able to like snipe them and full stack do it. So a setter who did this is maybe gonna make three to five points. But a full stack person here, you're going to give them the whole pie. So it's 15 20 points. So in your example of as long as it as long as the volume plus like the percent maths out is really what it is to where they are making. We like you know we pay above market it hurts the P&L. Yeah. Like we do that kind of in a lot of places. Uh we try and be competitive but like we always try and keep cost down. It's that game. But like if they are with the volume that they get plus the like ease of close that the math nets out to them making call it 40 grand a month because the top dogs make 500 in the space like you're all good. You could give them 10% if your leads literally were just clo like you know they were CS calls where you just like signed them up right like it's it's a consumption quality game. So that's my opinion is the volume plus the times the percent equals whatever they get paid. As long as that math is mathing, you're like in the money. And it doesn't matter if it's if market's 50 and yours is 20 because if you have the hottest leads possible, they're still doing the volume to where it makes sense. And that's where you have to like play with comps and stuff like that in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. Thank you. I I got into like, bro, just you saying that I felt like I was watching the YouTube channel. Like when I watch you like I have you open and I have like a notes pad. Like I literally got into that mode again because like the stuff I I need to learn all this stuff. But that's that's good. I'm okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. There's just so much in Yeah. detail and like in ink like whatever around that that's like Yeah. It's very specific. It's very specific to your use case and just to blanket it is maybe not a good answer, but I think that that works. But let's keep moving through these. We got we're on only on number seven of 29 on this. Uh Jesus Christ. Where are we at this one? We spend 5 to 10k a day on paid traffic. What do you spend a day? What's the most you've ever spent in a day? Before I continue this, the most that I've ever spent of my own money embarrassingly low. The most managed Yeah. The most that I've managed The most that I've managed per day was 100,000. Wow. And it was not This was not like through a full calendar year. It was a thing that was seasonal. It was Q3 they were ramping and so they had that spend there and then your normally their thing is like anywhere between like 30 and 40 but it was 100k period they were just doing they just like spent a million bucks on R&D for a new thing and they wanted to really get it out. They did their market research, all that. And so I was in charge of a lot of calories. Hammer. It was it was that period of I think it was like seven days where I got maybe two hours of sleep every day and aderall wasn't enough. I literally took methamphetamines to stay awake and work. So like, okay, I have a different experience of this. Uh I have a bunch of different experience of this. FYI for everyone. But okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Uh, dude, the most I've ever spent, like you saying embarrassingly low, like I've probably spent four to five grand of like my own out of whatever money that was like random testing some ecom drop ship or like affiliate link thing and then my ad down or I blow something up and then within the company, well, that's not true because I've actually managed spend that was up to like 25k a day for ACA like a year ago. But they literally handed me everything and we're like, we can't watch as many ad accounts as we have. Will you just like launch these and watch them? And I was like, yes, I can do that just for fun. And that was similar. I was getting up at like three in the morning because the ad account was on a European time zone. It was a whole thing. Like it was it was one of those games. But yeah, that's hilarious. But yeah, we I mean ours I think we've only max spent probably 35 40 in a day. Uh when we were like heavy kind of doing stuff and testing, but again I'm not buying right. Co-founder is up to 20. Wow. The co-founder that's good that the co-founder was in there. That's so important. He's a sicko. It's why we were able to do what we did early is because of visibility in copy and and like I built the funnels and stuff like that for sure. Like cool. That's tech piece. You can hire someone on Upwork for that. Like the messaging, all the copy, uh creative review, he wasn't actually making them necessarily, but like creative review, we always outsource that. And then the actual media buying, he was in every course. He was in every community. He had done it prior in some drop ship games and made a bunch of money just like messing around. And then Quinn came into this. Yeah. He spent up to 20ish, probably more for us a day every day. Was was when you were because you mentioned a lot on on uh on the channel that like acquisition broke at a certain period. What was it when you were at at those peak spend like peak daily spend times? Was that when it kind of broke? Yeah. Close to I mean it was around there call it you know within a 3090 window. Um but also at that time we weren't spending. We weren't spending. So we had done at that time we had brought in basically like a lead genen media buyer to do meta and then like a YouTube person Google person to do Google and it was like okay but their contract we never really had a we never had a marketing division because we were dumb and didn't know how to like hire for manage and he did that stuff and had enough oversight that he managed that and then I do all the funnels and tech and tracking and everything. So, we're like, why do we need somebody? Like, we're just going to cash flow this thing and never like build it out. And and then we got to a point, excuse me, uh we got to a point where we hired agencies. We had like a like ripcord style, like aggressive agency that actually did really well for us that like lives in the info coaching style space. um and did well for us for a while, but like it's almost like and again, no [ __ ] on them, like we hit some some of the higher peak months uh when they were coming in on it. Then it felt like they were not fully like in the accounts enough for where we were going with size. And that's on us as much, you know, as them, right? Where it's like we were navigating that. And then we moved off that, tried to go internal again, basically broke, hired another agency. And that's when and again, not on the agency, but like we had hammered this funnel. We had already done 20 something this year in that funnel of last year. Yeah. And it was just kind of like it was everything right. It was like the account needed to be run like info and coaching and consumption meant to be run not like ecom but then it was also that the funnel types and the acquisition methods needed to be updated. We needed multi. We needed different VSSLs like on front end. We needed a low ticket. We needed like more ecosystem on the front that we didn't have. Uh and it exploded and we were paying them 13% I think. So, we're spending a million bucks a month paying 130 grand to an agency that did everything. They did all creative and buying, but like it was not great. And we gave I mean, they gave us a lot of shots. We gave them uh them a lot of shot. Like, it was back and forth. We changed everything with pixels and track and all that at the time because something broke there. We had never really properly split test. So, we're throwing scripts on page to try and split test stuff. Like, we introduced a lot of variables uh when things started to break that but your CPA is going like this. your ad bill is going like this and your agency is a percentage across there but like you know is also climbing. It's like we were burning money in every bucket you could. So it was like we just pulled the rip cord did it ourselves and then since have built out these other pieces and we have like sickos for these individual but marketing team is whatever almost like two hands basically now and they are they've rebuilt the entire structure like you could say they have the same results if you look at like cost per call or whatever and cost and like volume but how it's structured and the ability for it to get the next layer of scale under this new leadership and team is like night and day. Yeah. Night and day. So that's Yeah. So that's our tangent. I want I wanna I want to like dive deeper into like outsourcing versus in-house, but I know we can do whatever we want. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we do have three hours, so like we can we can we can get into 45, but I'm good. Yeah, we can go we can go now or later. I mean, we're good. We're good. So to answer this one, what he asked and then we can bounce around is if you're spending they're spending five or 10k a day and how do you handle volatility because they'll have 10 negative 10% to 50% plus. I assume he's Oh yeah, right there he's talking CPA models of sending to VSSs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to actually because I asked him a bunch of questions in the Twitter thread right here. I have ADHD so I need to write everything down. So I'm going to open up the thread right here because I asked him a lot of questions. He has his answers here. So yeah. So I asked him, this is going to be a bit more in depth. So he said his uh blended new customer rowass across uh 30 days he said um made a total [ __ ] show around 6% um don't know 6% NCOS it doesn't really so I'm not sure what he was trying to say there uh 6% NC when he's saying CPA model he's meaning let's just I mean you're going to know better than me but are we assuming he runs call it affiliate ecom or something or affiliate model where it's 100 looks like it yeah okay so he spent 100 grand and made six Yeah. Yeah. I I that's I mean that'd be insane if you're spending 100 grand, you're making six. That would be crazy as [ __ ] I mean, okay. Okay. Um prim's 20%. So, okay. So, the volat volatility window that he's looking at is daily. Um which that's kind of first thing right there. So, I told him that usually when you're and actually Eddie mentioned this as well. um when you're looking at these this volatility on a daily basis and you can go by hourly is like you just go into the Facebook view you can see that during certain hours of the day right you get like higher OS lower R OS like more clicks less clicks like clickthrough rate can be as much as like 80% lower like during certain windows of time within the day and so if he's looking at that hourly then that's what I would look at but if I'm if I'm going to analyze performance and especially these big swings like that um he said like weekly and monthly are also volatile obviously if you consider 10% % versus 20% was like 100% swing. Um, I would really look at what are you doing during like let's like pick a window. So, let's say we pick a 7-day window because daily is way too short. You don't know like that's not even enough at that spend to get a statistically significant test through if you're doing like a test. We launch a new creative that's just not enough, right? So, I would pick a look back window and then be like, okay, this is what we did during this period from I don't know May 1st through May 8th. This is what we did. And so like now I'm looking at that window. We launched a new creative we launched a new creative concept that was around X persona with this angle during that period. And now we're seeing that our CTR let's say here because he was saying his CBR is the problem which leading indicator like I need to know those. Let's say like our CBR is like 20% less or whatever right doing that look back window. So we need to go back and test something different. That's like the number one thing which is super duper basic and like you talk about this a lot is just having visibility into what you're tracking and why you're tracking it and like understanding correlation because he literally said here the sale is in the VSSL so it's not like ecom where your creatives advertorials etc should do the heavy lifting if the sale is in the VSSL and like let's say I'm assuming he said he runs outbrain so you're doing clickbase so let's say the ad is obviously like with the with the graphic and the the headline all that stuff but let's say within your VSSL since that's your entire entire kind of like sales mechanism there is your VSSL. Um there's a million things to test within there. Treat it like a funnel, right? Because like you have your lead type, right? Are you going direct? Are you going indirect? Outcome based, promise, promise based, offer based, right? Like promo based, like you do a million things there. And then you have the structure of the VSSL. So you should be testing those. You should be testing that all the time. Um you had um God, I'm I'm really horrible with names, but he was the the branded drop shipping guy. He was talking about this how he test like 20 V. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 20 VSSLs or something crazy like that, right? Within I don't know what period I forget, but like he tests a bunch of VSSLs. And so that's the one thing if you're seeing this volatility. That's the one thing that I would look at. I don't know enough about Outbrain or like any like demand based platforms to or um DSPs to to like really give you any insight onto the actual media buying. Yeah, I've never bought media there. Um, I'd like to talk to someone who has, but I couldn't tell him like campaign structure and like blah blah blah all that stuff. So, I couldn't tell him there. Like the main thing is if you don't know what's going on within what period, if you can't tell me that between May 1st and May 14th, we were doing this, we excluded XYZ placement on Outbrain. So, we weren't like showing up on these news channels. And because of that, I saw that while our click-through rate, let's say like decreased by whatever 15%, our conversion rate actually increased, right? Because like this is just better placement, better leads, better traffic. Then like that's the first thing that I would do like first of all because the answers aren't really there. Like tell me what you're doing there. There needs to be a structured way like just the basics like have data visibility and understand what you're doing and what you're testing. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean that makes sense. Yeah. Because when I've talked to some of these affiliate guys in lead genen in the past, it's like you will have this until you crack it, right? And like that's what I've always heard is like you're testing these different things like you're saying and mainly if you're just running to this their offer, it's like a little bit simple example, but let's use like bridge page and like clickbank VSSL, right? It's like you can only adjust the ad. I mean, you're media buying land basically, which is as everyone says mainly creative at this point. And then you can have your lander and as long as your lander has whatever clickthrough rate within this pocket, like you just kind of leave it. Let's just say simple. And everything is over here. Everything is like how many different leads are you swapping? And then all of a sudden you're going to get your uptick. And then it's like now how many different bodies are you messing with? And then your CT like until you get one that goes from five to 20 to 50 and then hovers around this 50% or whatever drops to 25 whatever the you know KPIs are. But that's exactly what we've heard. We we do probably 20. It's it's roughly 20 new ads a week still. So not quite high like you hear you hear some people talk like way crazier but I mean for us like we have some tried and true ones that have like carried the accounts as like as the CMO says like we overuse some of them and that's probably an issue. Um but yeah their new generation cycle is roughly that there's like 20. Okay. I would say um about the creative testing thing because this is something that I'm seeing more and more people be aware of is that volume doesn't matter as much as one quality obviously because like the whole thing that we're optimizing for here with like creative testing is your hit rate, right? Obviously it's like you want a high like the highest hit rate as possible. So just just so you're like you're not wasting money on on [ __ ] ads, right? with Facebook specifically and I can talk to Facebook more than any other channel because like I've spent some like I've done some like PPC right in like in the actual ad account but Facebook's my baby. So with Facebook they literally tell you we want breadth of creative in terms of difference in creative they need to be wildly different right so not just format not just change a hook because everyone goes hook body CTA right no and we're going to get to there's there's a question that was talking about this post um that I made uh I can't say the word that was in the first sentence of uh of of the of the post itself. Uh, the PG. All right. It's the naughty word. Yeah, it's the naughty word. Um, creative strategist people talking about awareness levels as if that's not marketing 101. So, I'm going to go through some of these things here in terms of like creative testing, what you should be swinging for and how wide your swing should be just for context. So, number one, are you separating your messaging to target different uh demographic triggers? For example, using traditional news sources to anchor your USM when targeting boomers. So let's say you have an older audience, right? Something that's very apparent is that they still trust traditional media sources. If they're on like a certain side of the political spectrum, they're usually very very very religious about that, right? So if it's let's say like you have the you know a bit more like right leaning whatever they love Fox, right? For example, like as a go a bit deeper, figure out what they actually love like what your buyers actually probably watch. But let's say you have that. So, now that I know that, I'm going to actually test, let's say, and this can get a little bit gray hat. I don't know, like people do it, you know, especially on like the the advertorials and stuff like that, like they try to structure like news sites or Yahoo, whatever. Um, let's say in your ad, I'm going to do a uh an AI avatar where it's a uh a news anchor and the color scheme in the background and the structure of the graphics in the background is going to look exactly like Fox News, but it's not going to be the logo or anything like that, right? So you don't get obviously get flagged, but the structure, the super structure is there, right? And they're going to be talking about the same thing that you talk about in all your ads, but you're changing that, right? The the the the delivery mechanism of the thing because you understand that your demographic probably trusts this delivery mechanism of a message of an idea. And so you're going to try that, right? Like this is getting like super like, you know, I've tested this. I've tested this. It works. Another one that I've tested really heavily is uh the other one, so uh using the common en enemy when targeting uh African-Americans. I'm half black, so I can say this and not be racist. Um when you're targeting African-Americans, a lot of the times we're talking about the catalyst, right? If there's a skin, there's, by the way, there's a um CEOs brand that my buddy Ben showed me that uses exclusively targets African-Americans. You see this in almost all of their ads. It's brilliant. You target the system, right? Because this thing of oppression, right, of being marginalized is a huge component of that demographic, of that niche, of that community, right? And so you want to highlight that in your ad, right? And be like, they don't want you to know this. They're trying to keep this from us, right? This whatever thing, right? To keep us under, then use their language, obviously, right? So things like that. When I talk about breadth, let's say you have a product, you have three demographics. Let's say it is, you know, um 50 plus uh conservative men and then you have African-Americans, right? And you have all this. Test those things. Put that in there instead of having like the same structure of ad for every single demographic, every persona. It's like, oh, I understand their desire and I understand what problem they're trying to solve. No, be very, very diligent about that. Be specific. Go deep. And that's what actually Facebook loves to see is that variance, right, in what kind of creative you're actually putting out there. And everyone says this with format. It's like, oh, the before and after, the UGC, the green screen. It's not just format because Facebook is literally finding you like pockets of buyers in the ad ID itself. That's why everyone talks about like copy your ad IDs, copy your ad IDs because it literally understands the bucket of people who are buying the thing or engaging on the ad, right? And so you want to take that and you want to dial it up, right? And you there's ways to do this where like if you're not sure if African-Americans are like a good a good demographic that like will actually buy your product, there's ways to do this cheaply. Like we have AI tools now, right? Like it's not that expensive to actually roll out a test, right? But if you want scale, true scale, that's what you have to do. I think you cracked that one uh for that person. That's Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. like our our CMO talks about that of having like because we were talking about it more so in structure on how to run these things like already doing that already doing some version of like wildly different kind of pieces but then the literal uh campaign structure of things of setting it up so they live in their own buckets so that when it goes out and finds it stays within there and then you can kind of keep that thread. Same thing with going multi ad account is like when you carry over and I'm kind of getting out of my lane here, but I'm also like just echoing what I've heard with our structure is like they'll move stuff into a different ad account completely or test something that's like way out here and not just oh yeah this ad exact copy and asset worked and now we're going to use it over here. It's like yeah that can work when you're not having an issue with performance but if you're trying to solve for that then going complete you know right side right field and doing that is is interesting. So, okay. I think that solves that one. Um, yeah. You have anything? Uh, yeah. I was going to say your your de your your demographic is um what's the age range that you guys target? I know it's women, but what's the age range? 40 to 60 roughly. 40 to 60 roughly. And that's where like all your Okay. Okay. So, if Yeah. In your specific case, like you guys I know your CM knows your like your guys' customer like the back of his hand. Um I love huge TAM markets. That's always been my thing. gargantuan tam because it's easy and again I'm lazy. I like to do what I, you know, I'm lazy. I like this. And so I have the flexibility to test all of these different things, right? But like if you're within that and you kind of already have kind of like a guideline of who buys this, I would just do that do that depth just segment that portion out because I'm sure you have like African-American women who purchase this thing, right? Like they care a lot a lot about like ancestral stuff, especially the older ones. Especially I know me because like I got aunties, right? Like they care a lot about like how my ancestors were doing this XYZ how they were optimizing health, right? And so if you just segment out your your your women into like at least just one more bucket and you can test that, right? And you can get like I'm telling you insane results like insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're currently having a version of that when you're talking like demo of uh different brand faces that exist at different ages. Um, just that alone and just like a different person is a different person. Uh, so doing stuff around that that also has different storylines that has, you know, that all bleeds back to the same thing. And the biggest thing we're like pushing to solve for now is congruency across that. So, example of brand face 3 being in ads that then go to brand face one being in the actual VSSL. So, so we like tested a ton of stuff when it comes to the actual ads and like what gets, you know, the metrics right here and then as they carry through it's one thing. Now we're going that further line and doing the throughput of a VSSL that matches uh you know messaging the emails that m like we're we're going down that. Um, but that's interesting you say that about like, you know, different styles because we've gone deep in other corners of the messaging with the one and now that we have multiple, it's like using those multiple. So, yeah, that's interesting. Um, all right. So, this next one on here would love to hear about your scaling strategies, how to go from one to five to 10K with paid traffic and how you're structuring teams so you're not doing it yourself. So, what does your team structure look like at at your current setup or is probably what I uh Yeah. How you're structuring teams. So, you're not doing everything yourself. I'm doing everything myself. I do absolutely everything myself. So, so I um yeah, actually a couple days ago. So, we hired a web developer for a couple of our landing pages and I was so tired of going back and forth with changes. I just logged into Framer and did everything myself. I am the last person you want to ask about delegation, leverage, anything like that. Last person because I will do everything myself. And it's horrible and it's a habit that I'm trying to break, but I'm not I'm like from video editing to landing page design, every time I outsource it, I can do 10 times better. And this is probably because again, I don't have the economics to support someone who's way better than me. Obviously, duh. Once we get to that point internally, that can be a thing. I can talk to you about the other organizations that I've worked in where obviously there were people 10 times smarter than me in their own lane. I wasn't managing the team, so I couldn't tell you how to structure a team. Um, I can tell you like our managers were like, you know, desilo everything. It was like like a big thing. It's like, you know, like a duh, like those principles, but I couldn't tell you how to structure a team. So, yeah, I think the Yeah, the piece on this No, it's important. I think we go into that on you doing it yourself and because Yeah. I mean, I'm I hired a marketing tech on Friday and I have done marketing tech from day one. Like, dude, I it's a it's a skill issue that I have as very much so as well where it's like being able to do it through people. Hormones, you had a video about this the other day is like the ultimate leverage. Yes, there's code. Yes, there's capital. Yes, there's content, media, whatever. But like when you can do it through people and then they have access to that as well, right? So like what your intentions or strategy or plan are having that done through people at the same or better than you level is the key there. Um but I think I don't know I feel like for you you're you're almost too and maybe it's because you're not loud enough about this stuff yet but like you know your [ __ ] and like you can structure there's another I talked about this on yesterday's I think pot but like my first ever internet marketing thing was uh Instagram shoutouts. I bought some random course on Instagram shoutouts that then you do an opt-in page and then you selfquidate with a ClickBank offer on the back end. Like dumb as simple as sorry not dumb necessarily. People probably crush it but like simple as can be. But what I didn't realize was then I had to email the list in order to make the money on it. Right? That was the whole point is you just mail the list, you do content and then affiliate offers and like the classic give give freaking take basically in this model. Um, and I didn't have the wherewithal to understand, and I promise this loops, but like the wherewithal to understand that I could have paid somebody as a percentage of, and there's ways to do a deal that wasn't I need to pay a copywriter five grand a month that I did not have very clearly at the time. I spent like $500 and I had like $112 in my checking account after. like I I didn't have the wherewithal to understand or to have the skill or the confidence or the history or the exper maybe who is better at you at just video editing and not pay them five or 10 grand a month. I talked to some of the biggest dog like that tell me the what they pay editors and stuff and because of their clout because of where these people live because of the stuff because of who they find through pockets and pockets and pockets like the person exists out there that either is the cost that is in alignment because of international talent or that you can broker a deal with as a percentage or whatever or an up to or a performance base that like your P&L can support it on day one because you have the experience and you have like the for no better word the clout like and you could do that right now. Yeah. It's funny because I literally was that kid. That was me. I was the kid that other people took advantage of because I had this thing and you know XYZ and Yeah, you're right. Yeah. I you got and you got you got paid or whatever, but you got you got to learn it. And guess what? Somebody else wants to learn the other people around it. And like that's the part of partners or talent or stuff that's there is like you have to almost be okay with like some of the lack of experience maybe, but like the awareness that they're trying to grow to a point that they can leave. But like you can use them during that. That is you is a great example. Someone wanted to take advantage or use your skill set for what it was valued at at the time or what you valued at at the time that there knowing that you were going to go out and do your thing after. Like someone who had that awareness already knew that that you were going to be there for six months or a year and they were going to juice it and like their economics worked and your earning slasharning value grew and you went on to the next thing. It's like that exists everywhere and I didn't notice that early and there's a time and place to hire for experience. Like that is something we fell short on is everyone it was everyone's PR every time we hit a new record month like it was all of our best and like now just now as of whatever 3 to six months ago we have talent that's come in that's done new like way bigger numbers and can just like plug in the systems and do this but it comes with a cost a very true cost real cost. So like you got to kind of dance those games in my opinion. Um, but yeah, you're clearly at the awareness level and like the skill level in this game and cloud, dude. I mean, you tweet and you get 50,000 on a thing. Like you could find somebody, do your video editing and just do your video editing and drop them in a Slack channel and like help them with some little side things and just find that and like start to silo those things out and then eventually desilo them because then you're at the mercy. But like you have to silo before you can des. Yeah, very true. Very true. Yeah, that's how do you how do you reconcile personally? Because I I I have this thing that I do and I I'm genuinely in love with what I do. Like it's a it's a level of obsession where I can't imagine myself doing anything else or I'd probably be like hanging from a rope, right? Like this I found a thing that like I want to do for the rest of my life, right? How do you reconcile with okay outsourcing the thing that you genuinely love versus doing it but then also not having the leverage? How do you kind of reconcile those two things? Well, the easiest answer is if I mean it's completely what you you have to start with the goal because you don't need le like an artist that paints for fun and just paints and never makes money on it but literally loves it is going to do that forever and like that's fine. Like there doesn't have to be just because we hang out in money Twitter or wherever and it's like oh these guys make 50 million or 200 whatever. It's like if that's not your game you don't have to play it. Like stupid games stupid prizes and like if you're going to get up to this position where you have to manage 50 people or whatever and there's ways around that too to get still get the same size but like you can design it however you want it. It's like start with the goal of like do you okay cool is it some number and why is it that number because you saw it on the internet or because like you know how your life will change or how you live in whatever freedom capacity or nice [ __ ] or whatever and then is all my opinion by the way but like and like backing out of that and then knowing that once you get there how do you want to then approach it with that leverage because if you seriously are like oh I love these video editing it's like you can go real deep in anything and that doesn't necessarily mean that like you can You know the guys that are the copywriters that love it so much that now layer some AI into it but still do it to this day. But instead of doing $1,000 VSSL, they do 100,000 VSSL, $100,000 VSSLs with 20% backs on front end and whatever. Like there's a monetization game that no matter how deep you go in your skill set that you can get paid for. And the next layer of that skill set is yes, having a team of people that do it, but you're the best of copyrightiting, but you have copywriters and like you still look at it, you still touch it, you still live in the world, but you have team that does it. you have leverage. You have AI tools that do it. You have leverage and like so it's it's again it's the dance of that game. It's like if your skill set right now is vast. It is vast across this direct response space. Like the business model could be agency performance thing, but it's like and you can go real deep in that. You can be one of these guys that takes 10 or 20% of revenue and do 10 million a month. Like that's not uncommon. And like I know I know a guy does that. Right. So like that kind of stuff and you can have such a leaning team so you're not really like a manager you hang out with your friends that like the con models aren't alignment. Maybe maybe it's you know truly split up in partners where like you're living the freedom thing together. Like I know tons of people like that and us kind of included where it's like we all win together, everyone gets paid together. No one person is like making you know 90% of the share and instead we all are eating from it. It has to be bigger is a big thing. you have three partners, you have to do three times the amount of profit in order for you all to live at that whatever let's call it 100k you want to make. Like you got to do 300 for you all to eat. Like simple math, but really real. And like does the business model support getting to there where all your lifestyles are how you want it? Um but yeah, dude. I mean you're right there. So it's all up to what you want. Like if you say you love the craft, the question is you love the game of this craft or do you actually like clicking the keys and doing that? You can do both still. Like again, you can do it really high leverage or you can do it with team and still have leverage. Yeah, video editing was not the best example to use in that because I I genuinely want to shoot myself. No, no, but like the copy game, the direct response game. Yeah, like that was literally my my crux of doing the affiliate and lead genen stuff. It's like I could even do the scripting and that was kind of fun for me but like not great. But when it came to doing the videos and swapping hooks and swapping like files, it was like not the move. And then I tried to hire for it and I was like doing all this other like actual stuff and this was like a little side quest and I was like I'm not [ __ ] doing this. I'm not paying someone two grand a month or whatever to like edit these videos and they're relying on me for scripts and like again the model works. I know guys who do hundreds of thousands a month doing it and have one editor and they still do the media buying and it's like 90 whatever percent margin on their team and then on their actual stuff is their 25% margin on affiliate lead genen call it a day and they crank it just wasn't in the model yeah that I leaned into. But like you could do that right now. You could make I mean we don't have to dox that but like you could be in the hundreds a month all day. you know the lead genen guys and affilate guys that do it with yes one to three offers or skew or whatever types niches and then have a media buyer and a creative and that's oversimplifying but like basically so it's funny because I I literally have offer I have about maybe 12 or 13 offers just like that structure in my DMs now because either from clients that I worked with and they know who I am and so they hit me up or like they see my content like dude like I'm doing like there's a guy that's like I'm doing 300,000 a month right now. Like I want to get this to the next level and like I know it like my my marketing like my cold my cold prospecting isn't isn't isn't the best. My media buying is not the best. I have a guy there but he's you know I want you in there. I'll just give you 20%. I said no. Yeah. You know, but I I know it's there and you're in and you're you're you're right there. And I mean if you see a higher upside or because that's what you're right is you're just choosing what vehicle because you have literally nine of them that you could choose right now and you have 15 of them in your DMs or whatever right like yes that's it's just whatever one. So if you think that this one is the one that you can have the there's the whole game of like the cash flow game the the time for cash but then there's also the game that is this exit value and all these numbers and stuff and in 90 999% of the of our game it's like that doesn't really exist but there are ones that do you know you know you and I both know the lead genen companies that have exited that went for 50 orund and something the huge ones that went for like way big numbers but if you're talking like kind of lean teams there's ones that have gone for mid mid eight figures and if you can get a piece of that like that's a game. Most of what we do though is optimized for what is your time or enjoyment of that time to what dollar? We're just playing a way higher stakes game than you know your $12 an hour at some, you know, restaurant. You're doing it at upwards of, you know, 510k an hour depending on how in it you are. Yeah. Yeah. Very true. Yeah, I agree. Thank you for that. Thank you. No, no. I mean, no, no. Again, these are all my opinions and we are so in the we're all in the trenches. Your perspective is invaluable. genuinely. Well, I appreciate that. Um, all right. So, structuring team, both of us are saying we're bad at it. Uh, next, obscure networks and channels that do well. So, not your normal meta somewhere with huge awareness. So, so large audience, but how like basically how Agora's end of America is structured. So, what is a network or channel that is outside of meta that still has this mass approach? Uh, no idea. No clue. I am I like for the literally for the past three or four years I've been exclusively meta and Google. I know some guys who I talked to a little bit who like if you want to talk about like what like like ad networks like when you're saying like networks and channels like ad network like I know guys who do uh uh like TV, right? Like I know guys who do direct mail, right? Like I I Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I haven't gone super deep into with them because I don't do TV and I probably that's a huge channel, right? Um, but I know it's working well for them. I know guys who are on Apploving, right? And it's working really well for them. Um, I think I know there's Okay, if anyone knows anything about this, and I'm completely bullshitting, just like let me know because I might be completely wrong about this. I believe from one of my friends who runs on the app loan, he had there's another app network that's like kind of like this like targeted bundle of apps that is like similar to GDN. So like the Google display network very similar and I think they leverage the same dist I think but it's like this targeted bucket. So you can go like only games that are doing XYZ to like I don't know 5 million AUM or whatever. Um and like you can like do like very specific ad placements there that are very native looking. Those are that's something that I know. And then like obviously I it's not underground like everyone knows what display is but it's still massively underutilized. Yeah. right? Like like massively underutilized in the vast majority of niches. Like you go again go to M MSNBC, click on one, it's and it's always like the huge like full page VSSL with no time. Like it's always it's just that, right? Like maybe some insurance stuff, but like it's it's not utilized properly by most people. Yeah. Um yeah, those are the only things that I could I am not an expert in this. Do you know I I wish I knew more people who were like deeply entrenched in No, I mean we run that'd be something to talk about. We run we run probably 70 80% meta now and the rest is Google almost right and branded and then there's some cold that we're trying to crack but we've never like full scaled into that. Um the other one like classic is just I bought a course when it was hot. It was uh the Geekout guys James and someone else. They had a nothing uh nothing but native I think it was called at the time and they did like a fiveday workshop that was like get the recordings and be on live and I got on that and like I literally didn't even I just didn't understand right I this is all like the journey of me just like should I try this or this or this and like our main thing was going like you know we just didn't lean into it enough at the time which I regret massively but I was just learning all these things and that's where I learned about postbacks and that's when I learned about trackers and like I didn't know that stuff existed and so like if I could pick the value I got from that. It was that, but those guys were crushing crushing. It was all about loading in 15 landers with 15 different dynamic headlines and 50 different ad creatives and then launching them on tabula and whatever else. And like people crush it in that game. Um, I don't know how that works for info. Like we still don't do that to this day, but like the media buyer uh gal that we had that was a lead genen one. She was very heavy and spend like 2 to 500k a day crazy [ __ ] for um the I forget the title of it, but it's like the the lawyer the claims that's like the long-term cases where they're getting like a ton of people. Um she was a media buyer for that and then she was also info buying for us which is like very different. Um very different. But she was talking like push for example like they run all this stuff on push traffic and like I don't know that game. I don't like I don't know. So, I don't have an answer either directly, but yeah, there's obviously obscure networks out there. I don't And the big ones obvious if you can if you can crack them, they have the the size and the scale. Um it's just being able to crack them with the different funnel types, I would assume. And obviously the creative. Yeah. Yeah. I would um I guess like whoever answered that question like look into also like programmatic guys like I don't know like just do some googling there. I know there's a subreddit I a few posts on there like r/p programmatic. There's a lot of guys on there like maybe DM them like ask them a few questions because those guys are usually operating they they have to operate within like all of these things. They're programmatic ad buyers. So I guess them talk to them. I have no idea. I wish I knew. Yeah. All right. So ripping. Same. Uh how do you deal with weekly fluctuations specifically when dealing with CPM? What does your retargeting look like for people that are more bottom of the funnel? So again back to the fluctuations with stuff like CPM. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, CPM specifically is interesting because um I've gotten as high as when I was uh with the funding funnel when we were doing like the the 50k in 20 something days. I had as high as a $230 CPM. Guess what? It was still massively profitable. So, I was just like, "Oh, sick." And I posted the screenshot. I was like, "It's my CPMs." And I I just ignored it. Right? If you have if you can't do that then I would look at CPMs are interesting from my experience this is my experience everyone looks at this stuff differently so grain of salt from my experience what I've seen I can have a very high CPM and then my lagging my lagging metrics are insane like I can have a like a 6% outbound click-through rate right and like a 23% opt-in rate on the page which is literally what we ad on the $236 uh CPM campaign or ad. It was a 6% outbound click-through rate and a 23% opt-in rate. Not for a freebie, not for a lead magnet, not for a VSSL optin. These were leads who wanted to book a call and then it was like a lead form and then like a book a call page. Our book a call rate was 95% from the lead page to the book a call page. So, I was essentially getting 23% book a call rate, but my CPMs were 236 bucks. You think I give a single [ __ ] No, I don't I ignore. I was like, I don't care. Right. And then I had campaigns with like a 40 a $50 CPM, which is still pretty high, but like it's all auction dependent. Um, and they were getting horrible, like horrible like 1%, you know, like out on clickthrough rate like 15% off, whatever. Um, so a lot of the times when you see a really high CPM, it's because of your estimated like your E in your E, there's something there. you do have your your um your revenue per CPM as like an estimated thing in Facebook's like model. And so it'll look at that. It's like, "Hey, here's what we're estimating." Like your your um uh your uh quality score is super high, like super high. Your engagement score is insane. So guess what? We're going to charge you more because we know you're making money, right? Like it could be as simple as that. The traditional answer is if those things are not looking good, then Facebook is penalizing you for giving the audience a bad experience on their platform, right? They're not engaging with the ad because Facebook doesn't care about you as everyone thinks, oh, Facebook wants more people to spend money on more ads. No, no. They want more people to spend more time every day on the platform. And if people are not seeing engaging ads, and then that's then that's not going to happen. A very easy way to circumvent this is to engagement hack your ad. So like everyone like people and people say this all the time is like make your ads format your ads and optimize your ads for engagement. So a couple hacks with this um similar with YouTube where through plays are very important like on the organic side like on the organic side for Facebook because ads and organic run off of the same recommendation engine. Um, so if you look at your your hold rates, a very easy thing that you can do with your ads, look at Tik Tok shop. There was this one format where it was like, "My dad is a uh top paid neurosurgeon in XYZ." And he says this and notice the chick, she was like, she was cutting vegetables. She was doing something with her hands, right? She was doing something with her hands, like grabbing stuff, doing something like that in the background, right? I took that and I applied that to an ad with a UGC creator that we had that was she was already really like crushing it for us cuz she was Oh, she was hot. Um, so she was crushing it for us. And so I said, "Do a more native thing. Zoom out and I want you to do the same thing. Cut a cantaloupe. Cut a cantaloupe on your thing." And the everything else in the ad was the exact same. Same structure, same script, everything. The hold rate went from we already had it was pretty decent. It was like 20%. Went to 43%. So it more than doubled just from having that. And so I've learned some ad hacks. Hack number two. If you're doing a talking face ad, put some [ __ ] on your face. Like grab like I'm not joking. Grab dirt or something and smudge your face. I have tested this. Same environment, same everything. Dirt on your face, hold rate is higher. I've tested it. It works. I believe it. I believe it. There. So, there are these things. And of course, when your hold rate is higher, usually you'll see your CPMs go down. There are cases where it doesn't. And if it still doesn't after your creative is really really good and it's engaging and you can just tell by your hook rate and your hold rate. Sometimes people report ads. If someone reports your ads, you won't be able to see it on the front end. You won't be able to see it. Guys who have like insider rep um I'm sure you guys have like insider I don't know if we can dox this or not. If if if you want to say um if you have like insider reps on Facebook, there's like a dashboard that you can see where it's like actually everything that's flagged on your account and that's like kind of negative. It's like in this little yellow. Okay. Sometimes if you have an insider rep like they can show you that but it's not available for us normal people, right? It's like only for the VIPs who have that. Um you can't tell if someone flagged your ad. If someone flagged your ad and you notice that like for let's say I don't know a pretty long period it's an evergreen ad really stable CPMs out of nowhere just spike then someone probably reported your ad. What you can do there. Yeah. Some people some people say like and I'm not entirely sure either what's kind of like what's the actual deal with that. Some people say it's like the ad account or or like the Facebook page is cooked, right? Like like now you have to like test another ad account or another. I I haven't had that. I haven't seen that really. I don't know. That could be the case. Um but what I have seen works pretty well is that ad that has super high CPMs, take it off, wipe the metadata. And there's there's some tools that you can use to wipe metadata. Y and you can do it as simple as like mirroring it and then changing the saturation after you after you wipe it. So like Facebook visa as unique and just relaunch it and like for me at least like seven times out of 10 like that's worked like I if I've ever seen like that huge spike in CPMs where like for whatever reason an ad has just fatigued and I'm like I know this ad is really good and everyone's always like let Facebook decide no I I want to have some control. Like if that's the case then a lot of the times you can just do that and relaunch and it'll be fine again. I don't know why but it just works. Yeah. Yeah. I've definitely heard that. And then the initial point you were saying about we have an unconventional kind of setup where a lot of our stuff is purchase optimized even though it's a call funnel just because for us for the longest time it was just so much volume that you know it's hundreds and hundreds of calls a day let's say um and we didn't have anything filtering those to what is a quality call or not especially that happens on page for like a browser event. So getting a little more like technical into it, how we have since changed this and we have routing that occurs and certain things fire certain things different. So we can lean into the schedule world. We were doing custom conversions for a long time, but like to your CPM point, those are those can be high for sure, but like we'll have as crazy as like five times the cost per call like or more. And the cost the CPA is better than anything else. And it's like if you look at what that is on like cost per like the conversion rate on those calls for example like it doesn't even make sense sometimes like you're like because you know once you have a call you have a showed call then you have a closed call. So you have like your 2% you're dancing of your 50% show call it and your 30% close like 15% of those blended is going to close of those calls and then you'll have some of these sets that like call it 1 1200 and it's like 100%. like you have a,200 call and you have a,200 CPA and you're like what and there's like three that came through and you're like this doesn't even make sense. So like we definitely danced that that's what I was talking about like the structure change like our CMO has restructured this whole thing. So we have now stuff that fires on schedule that like works in a cleaner way. We have stuff that's purchased because now there's more signals but CPM and like what it costs per all to say like sometimes what you're saying is like not that relevant. It is not relevant if your cost per lead is $100 but you're targeting 20 if you're making 5x rorowaz on it. It's like who cares if you're if you have 150 amount of leads or whatever. So yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah y yeah yeah and I know this is way more relevant for for like what we do which is like lead call like there's other touch points like past that I know ecom guys like they have to be very diligent about like every single metric that goes on because they you know they just kind of have that they have to be very you know order one profitable all that stuff. So, I get it for the ecom guys out there. Like I get like your CPMs can be a massive thing that you're looking at, but yeah, like just look at like is your conversion rate on from that specific ad really like like really good? And I I've noticed this a lot of the times they don't know. They don't know. So like it's it's rare that they can actually attribute back to the ad the performance. Very rare. So if you're not doing that already, please go do that because my god that's really really important if you're not. And I've seen accounts like, dude, I've seen guys who spend so much money. You'd think, oh, you guys have UTMs and click IDs. No, you don't. Oh, okay. All right. Maybe do that first. Like, and they don't have it. And so, really, like, if you're not doing that, then do that. Attribute every sale, the conversion rate on all the funnels like to the ad itself. Please do that. Yeah, for sure. And then, and our example, right, is then doing that at the layer of the ad. So that what campaign or what optimization is that living in because that's so like we have attempted this is just so funny and I don't know how long ago this was and I refuse to say if it was recent but uh we are like looking at split tests on an opt-in page call it and one is running on schedule and one is running on purchase. The purchase ones, no joke, can have like a 5% opt-in rate, which is like the worst thing you've ever heard ever, right? And it's like, but it doesn't matter because how it backs out into calls and purchases. And it's like that's crazy to think about. So you're like, oh, just run that traffic at something that's not gated and it's like doesn't matter, right? Like the pockets that it can find, the algorithm can find on its own is like insanity and and that's obviously like the de the default purchase event, right? Yeah. So we have moved into Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's really funny because I was doing the same thing where not not like purchase but I was doing submit application versus schedule and because it's a default conversion event and like with Facebook's advanced matching it makes sense. It's literally find finding people who have fired that event on other people's sites and offers. And so it finds people who are most likely to guess what purchase, right? Or guess what? Submit application but not purchase. Just submit application, right? Or just schedule. And so it's really interesting. I've been now, which is kind of embarrassing that I haven't been doing this before, but I'm now actually starting to test the optimization event itself because everyone just goes for the default, but I'm now looking to actually test between purchase. I'm going to be testing purchase even though it's a call booking funnel. I'm going to be testing it, right? Because I want our like main thing is Yeah. Yeah. There's that whole game where it's like are you when you said earlier like Facebook knows how much money you're making or doesn't and you know you assume it's based on what you pass back to the pixel is them knowing right at some level. Um and you want that sometime like sometime you hear the people who game the system and make it so you know a purchase is passed in at $1,000 even though for you it's 5,000 so that the spread is different. Uh, for the longest time we did custom conversions just cuz that's how it was set up. And then when we did that whole switch over, we went to native. But I talked to guys right now that I've met through X and whatever that are like we have they basically set up call it C1, C2, C3, C4. And that's going to be your your classic like opt-in app booking purchase. Okay, let's just use those as example. Those four they've set up custom one, custom two, three, and four. And they even depending on they had this entire system that cooked for 90 days prior to when that health change came and they saw increased if not you know similar if not increased performance by optimizing for those and when they lost their purchase and they lost their stuff on their pixel because where they were categorized they continued to have the same performance they were still fine and like I know I know people who got waxed by not doing anything about this and we're just like oh we're able to continue to run on whatever schedule I don't even But like I know guys that got whacked by that and cut like a third and when it was a way around it that some of these agencies or some of these guys were doing correctly who knew how to like set these up from the get and again that's not something we personally dealt with but like I had two different guys that talked to me in DMs about how they set those up and I was like interesting interesting. So side tangent but yeah it's uh good on them for being um next one on here. Yeah, good on them. Exactly. Yeah. And I've also heard of horror stories of someone got assigned to it to make the change and didn't roll it out in time and then they had whatever like two days of data or I'm sorry, two weeks of data and then got cooked because they didn't they weren't able to cook the pixel long enough. Um and then they were running basically blind that then was feeding the new ones, right? Because it was like they didn't get the system set up in time to feed it and and and you know Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. That's the fun of it. Yeah. All right. down here we got is AI. That's the game is AI and direct. So let's just let's let's bucket this one as AI. So here are your high lever zones that you use AI right now. Yeah. So first is research. So I mean if you're not already, I'm sure 90% who are watching this have already used deep research either on GPT or on uh or with Google. I honestly honestly now especially now I'm liking Google's deep research more. like it does. It's just more a bit more depth. Um, so I'm going to open up the I'm still using the same exact deep research prompt that I me mentioned in my tweet here. I think it's to this day my biggest tweet. So I can share the prompt. Is that cool? Yeah, 100%. Okay. Okay. All right. Let me just find it here. should have had this on before bed here. Okay. Yeah. So, this is uh I took a bit of this from Stephan Georgu because he he tweeted this, but then I kind of added my own modifications. So, you want it to do if you're saying Oh my god, it disappeared. Sorry. One second. You're good. Sorry about that, man. Sorry. I should have had this. I should have seen that question here. We can do the We can do that. We just hit 130. So, anyone who's still here can hit the 1.5 in the comments. Just comment one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just Yes. There's a perfect gap. Yes. Okay. I'm going to have to Okay. Oh my god. All right. You know what? I'm not even going to mess around with this anymore. Here's the gist of If you want to If you want I'm sure you'll link my Twitter to the in the description if you want. I was going to say Twitter. Is that your pinned one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lowkey shout out. Just go to my just go to my just go to my Twitter. I'll pin it. I'll pin it after this video so that people can like actually go to it and see and it'll be like it'll be like the the full actual prompt. I have it in Google Docs. You can accidentally copy and paste. Um essentially it's a research doc that goes into a research prompt that goes into the first of all pain points like the basic ones, right? So pain points, desires, market awareness, market sophistication, very basic ones, right? Then what I really like that Stephan did was he did what is the uh I don't want to butcher this. What is the common perceived solution around the thing and then what are the core limiting beliefs he didn't say limiting what are the core beliefs around how effective slashineffective this thing is. So first of all, you have to give the GPD context as to what you are selling. So don't do any like copy. It' be like very specific. What do you sell? Very specific, right? I sell CMOS that has XYZ ingredients, right? And then like literally list out the ingredients. I want you to do deep market research about XYZ. And then you like literally list out the bullets, right? And then you want to prompt it and tell it, I want you to look at Reddit threads. I want you to look at Trust Pilot reviews of competitor uh websites and it'll find your competitor websites, especially Google. It's very good with this. GPT I found can hallucinate sometimes. Google's like really really good with this. It'll find the competitors um forums Kora and then it can do like YouTube. It does YouTube videos and comments and then I think it does some Twitter stuff but literally like make it source from like everywhere and it's going to compile you literally who your customer is, what beliefs they have. Like it'll map out a persona for you too. It'll be like this person is XYZ like age range and then gender and then it'll literally do like political beliefs and everything like like the whole entire thing with the full prompt because it kind of summaries it shittily here like with the whole prompt it'll give you all that stuff and it's like then it's hidden desires too hidden desires and hidden pains. So this is a big one. So let's say I'm going to take I'm going to take bisop as an example for the hidden desires thing. So people have hidden desires. They have the normal desire make more money. Then you have the hidden desire, right? And that is um I want to pull into my driveway with a new BMW M3 so my neighbor's wife looks at me and wishes she was with me and not her husband. Like those are the hidden desires, right? Hidden desire. I want to I want to make more money so that I can walk into work, walk into my manager's office, tell him [ __ ] you to his face, and then leave. Right? Like these are those hidden desires. And what this research prompt will will literally do is it will compile from like usually from Reddit. It'll compile all compile all these hidden desires and it will list them and you can make it just tell it to do like 20, right? And it'll list all of these things out, right? And then it'll also do the same thing just the inverse for hidden pains, right? Because you have your pain point, your main pain point, then you have your hidden pains or unspoken pain points as well, right? And so it'll do the same thing for both. That's the most relevant thing for me. And I tell it to pull direct quotes. That's actually a modifier that I don't have in the original post. I'll add a comment there like pull specific examples and then link the source, right? Because what I do as well is I have a little Chrome extension that does um Reddit thread like it'll it'll scrape the comments and the replies from a Reddit thread. So, I'll use that. I'll go to a Reddit. Yeah, I'll go to a Reddit thread about the topic. This is the most the the best thing that you can do if you're selling to problem aware or perceived solution aware. Look up, let's say, problem aware bucket one, solutionware bucket two. Uh, look up 10 Reddit threads from problemaw aware people who are saying like, I'm struggling with XYZ, like any advice, right? Open up every single Reddit thread, all 10 of them. Use the extension uh, scrape it all, right? Put it into a CSV and then upload it to a GPT like your main GPT copywriter project thing if you have that or Claude copyriter project like if you guys have that. If not, you can just upload it to a new chat, whatever. Um, and you can tell it like, "Give me give me the five most common recommendations from other people to solve this thing." Recommendations is the main thing because now you're now you're getting to the perceived solution aware. Now, when you're getting the recommendations from people, I was like, "Oh, this is what people think will solve this problem." Now, for solution aware, it is same exact thing. What have you done to do this? Right? And let's blah blah blah. You can do this for competitor reviews. You can do this for literally anything. And it just it takes like five minutes because you just compile scrape CSV upload it to uh to to chat or to claude and it just does it like that. I use it now I use AI mostly for ideiation on those two fronts. So what have people been doing? What do people think about this solution? What have they been doing to solve this problem? And what do people believe is the best solution to this problem right that they have? Again if I'm going for like problem aware, right? Like it it differs if I'm doing unaware. If I'm doing unaware, I don't I don't use AI at all. If I'm doing like an unaware um thing, it's like a very indirect lead type. I I really don't use AI because you just have to be like you have to be cracked to do indirect lead type ads. Like this is what those OG copywriters that was like their whole wheelhouse. Like you have to be so good. I avoid it when I can because you can easily mess up. I I really avoid it. You can very easily mess up and I'm pretty good at copyrighting. Um so that's how I use AI there. And then if you have um if you have a claude project immediately prompt it on a PDF or a rich text file usually so like your because you have your your memory like claude like the the usage like it kind of caps out really quickly. So convert in like PDF whatever to a rich text file. Upload a PDF of great leads by mass uh I forgot his first name but the last name is Masterson the book. Um upload that to it and you have to instruct it that this is the structure. This is copyrightiting training. This is the structure of how I want you to write these things. Upload that to your project and everything else is in the tweet that I made. I literally have like everything to train a cloud project on or a GPT project on for it to write you ads. I have found it does not matter how many files you give it, training material, how good your instructions are within the chat of and maybe I'm doing it wrong because I'm not an AI expert by by any means, but I still use it obviously. Um, the best is to shoot it a winning ad either that you've recorded or if you're going for like if you have some inspiration from like affiliates, you can just transcribe whatever ad that they're running. Look, I want you to write me an ad. You have to describe the entire ad to it. Basically, you have to really make sure that it understands. Follow the structure of the example that I'm sending now. And if you use like all the like all of my like prompting and instructing that instructing that I have in that tweet, it'll spit out like insanely good ads, but without that example ad, it kind of it kind of loses itself. It really kind of loses itself. I'll be honest. And then you just copy chief the the the outputs, right? And you know, that's how I use AI. I I I don't you there's some agents that um my co-founder is like really good at ops. He uses some like some agency workflows for like operations. I don't know any of that. I choose to ignore it, pretend like it doesn't exist and just let him handle it. Um but that's all that I use for AI when it comes to messaging and copyrighting. That's banger. Yeah. And that's what that's your pin tweet. Uh I'm going to let me pin it now. Actually, I was going to say pin it so before we all forget. Um but yeah, no 100% go check that out. I've seen that thread and there's a lot Yeah. I mean that's major sauce for the biggest one in the front end. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's my biggest 703,000 views and 5,000 likes and it's something like 20,000 bookmarks pin to profile. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, just check it out and everything's Let's keep moving through this. But yeah, that's uh that's unbelievable. I know our CMO when he came in he did like a full like you can't stop scrolling at the market research doc that he started with and put together and like he has found pockets of things that were like oh that's interesting and then same with uh he because we had so many assets already in terms of like because we can map back we have everyone's application ever so call it 500,000 applications that's cool but then I can tell you which ones of those applications purchased and then you can dump those or onboarding surveys or customer check-ins or whatever so like you have the customers. We have hundreds of thousands of data points on customer side of things. Like that's even how we we did it preAI, but that's how we landed on the age demo is because we didn't have an age demo that was like that. It was about the messaging to start and like broader and then as we saw who got the best results, who resonated with the messaging we were using the most. Like we found this pocket of age demo and then now leaned into it which increases everything across the scale like across the board because of you know congruency. But like before that we didn't know that and like that came out from looking at what is the age of our average buyer and like being able to pull that data and then now being able to take the thousand other like data points and put those into AI has been like oh that's an interesting they all say this phrase like this phrase has been used 40% of the time and things we're like oh that like all on the customer side not even on like the uh what does the market say it is what does our customer say and it's like that was really cool for us he did a ton stuff around there and found some gaping holes that we weren't doing and has leaned into those. So, I agree with you on that use case. Are are you or is he are you guys doing something where you have like the sales call transcriptions um that are like auto uploaded and then you can kind of like because you I'm sure you have like the lead scoring and all that stuff and then it can use that like by pipeline stage like close and then ACV all that stuff. you kind of cross reference the transcription of the of the sales script and then from that it'll pull yeah a light version of that. So we do we have so much going on and we had we were scaling so much that we actually did that first for like an analytics and like uh fulfillment aspect. So we did that with the actual coaching calls. So inside product uh was the first place that we did that and then we ended up rolling out for coaching and like or to coach the sales team we rolled out with uh zoom revenue accelerator which is like gong AI or whatever and they do that whole thing and it's keywords it's you can upload a checklist that you have that auto assigns to it. So it basically gets transcribed, has the video transcribed, and like within whatever five minutes you have a checklist that's like, did they take control? Did they set the agenda for the call and it's like yes or no? And you can choose radio button, you can choose how much. You can choose like how you want it to be ranked. But let's just say it's yes, no. The beauty of it though is it'll say no, they didn't. And you're like, okay, why? It gives you the snippet of what the AI spit out of like they didn't take control set the agenda because in the beginning the person was on their phone then moved to their desktop and then their cat was running around and this and this and it'll tell you that. So it'll give you the answer to why it chose that. So gong I think is like 10 times more intense than that and has more stuff but it's really expensive and we were like back and forth with our sales leadership and team and like how we were doing things. So we're like maybe don't put $100,000 into a software when there's probably some easier land grabs. So we were like, let's not do that. And then we ended up landing on ZRA because we already whatever we brokered a good deal where we already paid for too much storage and it's very low cost for us in comparison to what we were paying. Um, so yeah, so we use that right now, but like uh HubSpot just rolled it out as well. So HubSpot now natively inside there. I think you have to have co-pilot or whatever, but when your call recording shoots in, it now gives you an AI thing that's like so and so said they were going to reschedule a call for next Tuesday. This happened, this happened, like automated notes that come out that are AI. uh which I like a lot but yeah I mean we don't have to go into my world of AI but the marketing side of it definitely uses that sales uses that maybe another one uh the we're here to pick your brand um but yes there no no uh and then sales yes is used there and then fulfillment is used for analytics more so and like fulfillment like basically standardization making sure that things occur that are supposed to occur uh you know in infer on things like time and context next. So, yeah, we used it in a couple places, but nowhere near where we could or should. And then on the automation front, we just moved a ton of stuff from Zap to NAN and it's like $150 a month for that versus what we were doing, which was 4,000 a month or something on a Zap. So, yeah. Yeah, we've had some cost savings, but we're in the we're in the lie of rolling all of that out like a toz uh with a with an external company that we just contracted. So, I'm excited for I know that I know Matt Ryder talked about his um because I think there were he said that they were doing Yeah. Yeah. And that that Yeah, that's something that um Well, we'll get into that. We'll get into that after like all the all these question. Dude, I have so many questions for you. Jesus Christ. We'll get into that after if we if we have some time. But I haven't mentally not yet. Um here, let's try these ones are shorter. So, let's see if we can keep these a little tighter and then we'll see. Where am I at? What's one skill you wish you mastered earlier in your journey? Huh? Going to be a weird one. I wish I read more fiction earlier. Interesting. If I were Yeah. If I were to attribute something that I did to my ability to write very compelling copy, it was reading fiction. The reason why I believe is because when you read fiction, you become the person. You become the hero character. Their struggles become your struggles. Their pains become your pains. Their journey becomes your journey. You feel their fear. You feel their their pride, right? and you just become entrenched in their world. And that is something that you must do. It is a prerequisite if you want to talk to someone. If you want to sell someone, if you want to talk to the avatar, you need to do the exact same thing. That level of empathy, which empathy is inherent, but applied practiced empathy is something that I really wish that I had practiced earlier. And the number one advice that I could give to like any beginner copywriter here where it's like what should I do to really hone my skill set? Number one, read sales letters. Not copywriting books. Read sales letters. Hand copy all the stuff that everyone says to do. Hand copy them. Blah blah blah. Read the Gary Halbert letters specifically. The water ad specifically that one. If you've read it before, read it again. If you've read it twice, read it three times, etc., etc. and read his notes on why it worked. And then the next one is to read is to read fiction, more fiction, because you start to get a grasp for how to compile a narrative. And that is one of the most important things. Also, it just hones your skill in writing period, which I said this before, copywriting is writing. You'd be shocked at how many copywriters are dog [ __ ] writers. They don't know how to write, period, let alone copyright. So yeah, that's one thing that I wish I did earlier was read more fiction actively and knowing how to apply that then to copy. Interesting. Yeah, you just said something there where you said uh learning how to write and like the meta skill of learning how to write and then obviously you need that for that. I I made a video about this talking about how like stupid it sounds, but enhancing or like increasing your mouse speed, learning how to type faster, like these simple things are like these super meta skills that are like yes, it's crazy like the the lifts you can have. If you're on a computer 12 hours a day and you can go 30% faster than the guy next to you, like you have the same skill set, you're going to win. It's like it's stupid, but like yeah, the that's an interesting question and a very interesting answer. Fiction. Okay. I've never been good at that. And that's and that's what the whole obviously I mean but like that's story ideas that's like you said hero story that's the idea Okay. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. And I I would tell you the the exact kind of fiction that you want to read is one where you have a complex world where they do a lot of world building and you're still engaged because what that means that they had to get you to care about the character so deeply, the main character so deeply while keeping your attention between a bunch of different elements. And that skill set of retention obviously goes into everything else as well, right? And what the reading will do, why it's specifically reading and why it's not like, oh, can I just learn how to do this thing is because with reading, when you read, at least when I read, I can read six hours at a time. I have to physically stop myself from reading because it just happens in the background. Your your brain just really retains all of it, right? And is so much of it is subconscious. and read stories that again have that those complex worlds and that really keep you engaged. I would say if you can't be engaged within the first 20 chapters, scrap the book and try to find another one. If you're like being tactical about this, yeah, I would say that interesting. Okay, that's a good one. Very out there answer genuinely if I think about it. Yeah. No, no, I like it though. It's good. Um, how do you choose high converting? Okay, so basically what's your offer selection? So high converting offers, how do you pick which offer you're going to run? And let's just say this in in the context of picking a niche in picking an offer on a network something. It's like you're starting from scratch. Like how do you pick which one you think is going to have the most Yeah. Um, this is also something that I couldn't speak to as much as some others because I usually came in when they already had product market fit or they already had their I mean I did some like offer like offer presentation but they usually almost all the organizations already had some level of product market fit and distribution. Um, I will say how I started with how I picked repair like credit repair as the as the service and how I picked um funding. Now, I'll start with credit repair. Um, was the lack of sophistication around the organizations that were marketing it. And so that like that that's the easiest one is like if I can that's an interesting one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I can very easily tell that the biggest guys like the biggest guys in um repair which funnily enough they got sued and went bankrupt recently um forgi on Lexington law in credit repair.com they were doing around a billion a year and their advertising was horrible like horrible. so bad. And so I went like down the run. Like I kept looking at all these like repair companies. One guy I met, he ran a 20 million a year repair company and I just I went into his ads library and saw the ads and they were horrible. So everything was horrible. And so I was like, "Oh, I can just beat you." And so that's why I picked repair and I did and it was great. Um you you mentioned on your on one of the videos that you were selling a $500 product over the phone, right? I was selling a $200 product over the phone [Laughter] with a referral. That works. That works. I mean, it look it was uh Yeah. Know, it was interesting. I had to somehow incentivize commissionbased closers to be on the phones for I think it was like 30 to I I gave them like 30% plus um uh plus of all the residuals and all the recurring on a $200 product. Yeah. Well, that's back to your that's back to your question earlier is how do you make the math work for someone like that? So, where the the economics sense, but it's same thing. It's like when we were doing that, someone asked me about that or I was talking about the other day and I was thinking about it like I I need to pull receipts on this, but I want to say our cost per call was like, you know, 50 bucks, 80 bucks, somewhere in that range. So like the map worked and because it was essentially an offer to an audience that kind of already existed, it was almost like a retargeting situation in the beginning or like sending it more to warms. We had like more layups. The cost structure and where the market was made sense. Like it was almost like we were overdoing it for what we were trying to sell that could go direct to car probably. But like it it worked at the time and worked at the time. Yeah. But that's interesting. So your main thing is in markets that you can compete where you can layer in your skill stack that maybe there isn't a skill stack prevalent in that market. Okay. Yes. Because again I'm lazy and like I'm like I'm a little [ __ ] too. Like I don't I don't understand the like the backend stuff again like the operations itself. I know people who are so insanely sophisticated around creating alpha in other departments. My alpha is the marketing. And so, of course, that's what I lean towards, right? And so, that's what I'm going to be leaning towards when I pick an offer. Um, if you're if you're if you um if if you have an offer and you're let's say you're in ecom and you're selling I don't know supplements or whatever and you're trying to to choose an offer before running traffic. um if it's a already pre kind of like a pre-proven offer where it's I don't know um CMOS and you're using a either a buy one get one or um you're doing like a you're doing like the MR play right where you can kind of get a grasp on what your economics could be and then you you know you're like okay if I get you know 10% to ascend to XYZ then I can be profitable here like you're already halfway there just like just do the math like from back to just do the math on like what you need to hit everywhere and then literally just run a testing campaign and then just like see what you know see what's working if and like usually cuz like a lot of the times like creative now is like the the number one thing and it takes time to get to the winning creative. So a lot of the times your metrics won't be there like your your target CPA isn't going to be right there because you're just not as sophisticated on the ad side. But if it's wildly off where you're not where you know that you couldn't realistically get this number down then maybe that's not the right thing to go with. But like in terms of like Yeah. How do you think about the So what about things like that are commod this kind of question earlier but the commoditized stuff like talk insurance or like you said MVA at one point or those like how do you why why go into those markets then if those are kind of different than that right like those are all the top guys in the world say are trying to run final expense let's just say like yeah yeah so I can tell you from uh when I was in MBA which I have a very stringent NDA around this. So, I have to really think about what I can and can't talk about. I just won't I I won't I'll barely I I won't dock as much. Um right now MVA, they're struggling because CPAs are just like because everyone entered that market like everybody. And so I believe um the guy who does the the $50 million paper call business, he was saying the same thing with um with ACA, right? where like just everyone just flooded in there and they were running a bunch of like greyhound that was like different like the actual like offer owners were just like cutting off the partnerships with like because everyone was running grey hat right and the calls were [ __ ] um with MBA it's just like the CPAs are just through the roof right now and the reason why I went into that specific MVA company well they were obviously an an affiliate agency but they also had people on retainer um the reason why I joined that was because I saw that they were running one ad still live that was getting most of their spend that they made three years ago. And so again, there's that thing of, oh, I can just beat that, right? And I did, right? Like within literally like week one, I scripted, recorded, edited the ad myself. I I was literally in the ad. It was me like saying the script and everything. But it was cool because the spend like the spend per day that I got was insane. So it was still high lever high leverage. Um, and yeah, I beat it, right? And so that's why I was in in in in MBA and I just kept doing it. I just kept iterating on the actual creative that was being ran, right? Um they were very those industries, they don't understand what it truly takes to win on paid traffic, especially not meta. If you're running final expense 90 or Yeah. Fi yeah final expense, although I don't know that industry as much. I will say directly like MVA and like credit repair too because like you have paper call networks for or offers for credit repair too like these like big like these industries that are just like there like their ads are like looking for your thing call this number or click here like the most basic thing in the world and so I wouldn't if I was you if I was them the person asking this question and I want to choose an offer that's that I want to run I would literally choose an offer where the vertical is unsophicic icated in terms of creative testing, copy, scripting, all of that. And I would try to beat them on that level is like first and that's like pretty much and then I would just do that until that doesn't work anymore. And then I would choose the next offer, right? Like where's another what's another vertical where they're just not they just haven't gotten there yet, right? Which I'm sure there's a million other ways to choose a better offer, but that's like how I've done it and it's worked pretty well so far and that's how I would that's how I'm continuing to do it now. Um, another thing, another thing I'll mention now the the funding. So, monetization on the funding obviously backend like right, but we ran into a problem where we're like, my god, like the amount of people who are actually qualified for because we do primarily lines of credit. We're not dipping into MCA because I think it's genuinely a horrible product and I I'm not I'm not I wouldn't feel good selling it. Um, but we get our commissions on lines of credit and like 0% interest credit card stacking and we have this problem of like people just aren't qualifying. So I was like, "Oh, what if we created a funding optimization offer on the front end so we can liquidate people who aren't qualified now and then of course like our ascension rate can be there. We can pick up some dollars on that as well." So it supports both. No one's doing that. Everyone is just running and guess what the funny optimization is just credit repair. Like we've already done this before because we had customers where they where we repaired their credit and they got they got approved for XYZ whatever, right? And so now we're just transitioning that over to funding, framing it as funding optimization. Now I can all of a sudden charge three to four times more obviously because the outcome that's anchored but also the way that I'm positioning it, right? Yeah. And now I can liquidate front end like our front end is was very profitable. Um and then also I can get our ascension rate, right? Like so from introducing a brand new market, right? Ascend to application to funding and I still get the qualified people at the same time, right? So I'm just double dipping, right? And so I would do that too if I'm like seeing Yeah. Like if I'm saying something like this is like the the like hidden economics is as Allen calls it like I I like actually wrote down some examples like a lot of guys in the um a lot of guys who are running very similar to what you said where you're running the Instagram shoutouts and getting the email and then look at it like so many people still do like solo ads right like where they'll compile a list maybe they'll they have sold but then for a bucket that didn't ascend to their mid ticket which was the goal they'll just rent that list out to another person right and be like run your ads here and then I'll get an affiliate commission, right? That is a massive that is a massive portion of their actual like contribution margin dollars right there, right? Is that thing right there where if they didn't have that, it wouldn't be profitable, right? So like there's a lot of these like hidden economics espec also in credit repair too. Like the amount of people that just sell like payday loans to people like hey we're you're our customer and now you're qualified. Like it's horrible. I don't like it. It's unethical. But like those things make up a massive component of why that business is profitable. And that's tough because you don't know that until you're in that in that in that industry in that vertical actually running that business. You just don't know, right? But on the front end, that's what I do. Can I beat other people? Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. I mean, very similar to how your other response was for the other section of commoditized or not, like you're just beating them in the game and plain and simple. Like you're just able to win against the control, which is Yeah. And then yeah, we we were at uh Stephan Georg's copy whatever thing. We went I believe. Um we went to an inerson event and like so cool and the guys they had there like I love like all his stuff that he does but that's where we met Eddie for the first time actually uh that's when Luke and I met Eddie and then also um we met a guy there that was the data guy and he was talking he's like bro you guys could be making 200 grand a month more on your list just like farm it out and do all this stuff and we're like that's just not our game right we bought the we want to those leads and it's like our stuff is bigger brand but for a lot of people I bet that is a hidden economic that works great for somebody who's just pumping an offer. It's like why wouldn't you be doing that? I mean, I don't know. I don't even know compliance wise because we don't we don't do it. And like but I don't know where that sits, but yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, it can get very tricky. And I know I know some guys from um nothing held back who got like in trouble. They talk about it like they've got in trouble for Yeah. Yeah. They've gotten in trouble. So, I would not recommend it. It's not my game. I I I know a couple guys that are like big wigs that have gotten hit and like it's just not my game. Like and there's accidents where it's still you're still at fault, right? Like pure accidents and like that's the unknown stuff that scares but anything that's even close to that line like we're like nope like no good no good nope nope nope and the fear is around the stuff that's unknown or like something. So we have every once in a while we have like you know full audits basically and like look at everything and like oh change this language based on this now it's like okay we update that or make sure you do this or you know there's every once in a while there's one of these and like we do that as much as we can and try to get ahead of it. So yeah it's interesting. Yeah. Um, next one on here, Reddit forums to drive affiliate traffic. Wait, have you used Reddit or other forums to drive affiliate traffic? Affiliate traffic. What works best? No, I I'm I've been paid ads and I've been paid ads pretty much my entire career here. Um, besides when we were doing um besides when I was doing product stuff, I was in charge of um activation rate and ascension rate um in the the SAS product because we were doing like a PLG thing. I've never done traffic that hasn't been either paid or organic. And even organic is is not that. But no, not traffic. Now, of course, back in my uh I'm a changed man now, but yes, I used to do the uh like the Reddit spoofing thing where you would basically hijack um like a thread like you would bought it with comments of like your brand. So, people would search your brand and then the Reddit thread comes up obviously it's a bunch of people saying like pretty good things. It sounds natural. All fake of course. Like I've done that. I think everyone has at some point, but besides that, to run traffic, no, I never have. Could not say. Yeah, we've never done it. Um Jeremy Haynes talks about this a lot. He's like they came up on somebody who had basically like a 20 or 30% show rate and it was because of a bunch of like Reddit threads. Um I watch that video. Yeah, it's it sucks when there's like the deceptive ways of doing like not deceptive negative ways that are like attack version. It's just like frustating. It's frustrating. No, but there's also ones where like someone has a bad product and they go across and they have bad reviews and it's like I got to get this taken down. It's like dude if you have a bad product or you don't or this like that's its own game. But sorry, go ahead. Uh I was going to say I know a guy based in Russia who he does a lot of very interesting things. Um he's kind of like a mercenary for hire. So you come to him, you're like like hey I have a competitor. Uh can you make that competitor not a competitor anymore? and he'll do some things and he's done that before where he'll just he'll literally like steal branded traffic to just like fake bad reviews like as simple as that and it works. Yeah. You know, not a game that I would ever be in but you know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you just got to knock knock on everything and just like you know be good intent as you can and just like that's our game plan of it because like Yeah. I mean you think about it like the bigger companies that's kind of like my justification is like by no means are we some massive thing even in general but like I know guys that are five times 10 times the size of us that deal with you know a little of that but not really you know the public companies that have everything public and it's like they deal with that and it's like just shitty you know sometimes but it's part of the game I guess. Yeah. Yeah it is part of the game. Yeah. Um what do we have next on here? This one. No we already had that. That's a similar one. How do you handle objections and educate prospects between booking an actual call without giving away so much that they feel like they don't need to show up, which is that's an interesting way. Ah, okay. Um, I'm going to call out my homie Ben here for a second because he runs a uh cap Oh my god, Ben, I'm so sorry, dude. I forgot your last name, my man. Ben, everyone's going to be looking for you on No, no, no. Let me actually let me actually find him real quick on Twitter. Let me shout him out because uh he he actually gave me the sauce on this and I'm very diligent with actually like telling people that this was not me. This was him. One second here. Pretty sure it was Kaplan though. Ben Kaplan. Ben Kaplan on Twitter. Ben Kaplan. Anyone who's still here, you got to comment at two. Yes, Ben Kaplan. Hey, I got it. I got it. Okay. So, he runs a um he runs a a call center. I'm not going to dox everything that he does, but he told me about like how in B2B it's like the more information you give the better. Actually, there's no such thing as so much information that they don't show up in B2B specifically. And what he told me is like he has like a flow that he does. I'm not going to share what he does because it's like really really good. Um like you need to know like what actually to say, like what objections, what questions to to actually ask them. I'll give away what he actually asks, but he does it in such a way where people will show up on the sales call and be like, "Yo, dude, like thank you so much for asking me all these questions. Like, thank you so much for like giving me all this information." Like the preall stuff like it was fantastic. They show up because of that, not because you get like there's no such thing as giving away too much. Now, for consumer, um, if you want to handle objections and educate prospects between booking an actual call, do yourself a favor. Um, I will actually share this on Twitter after this episode as well. There is a postbooking u VSSL framework by the goat himself, Alan Sanic, that everyone needs to take and copy and make their own. He made it free available for everyone because he's a G. Um I will post that or like DM me and like I'll send it to you. Um use that first of all because he's like he's insane. He does all that. Um, a lot of the times when it comes to objections, especially with consumer, I found that it's not actual objections around the thing, it's very similar to a call. Um, and Jeremy, like Miner talks about this a lot where it's not the actual objection itself. It's something like they're they're hiding it, right? And so a problem they're hiding like why they actually like it's just well actually man, it's because of XYZ. Actually, dude, it's because of this, right? So like if you know how to pre-handle those on a sales call, it's good. And so what you can do if if you run a sales run a sales work, the best thing that you can do is when you have if you know how to handle those objections and get to the actual core reason why those objections came up and what are the actual ones, just take those from your sales data, right? And actually answer those because a lot of the times what you think in is an objection in the market isn't actually an objection. And if you try to answer the wrong thing, it'll have the adverse effect of what you want to do. And another thing that I've noticed, yeah, a lot of another thing that I've noticed a lot is like I was I ran this um I ran ads and did copy for this like ecom bisop thing. Um and they were like very faceless. They they had like a guru, but it was one of those it was one of those like medical you know those medical had like the supplement ads where it's like the fake doctor, right? Like it was that before the ecom stuff which is kind of smart. Um, and so in the post booking it was it was a problem like we had maybe like 43% show up rate and this was three years ago. So that's really bad three years ago. Like horrible three years ago, right? Yeah. Really bad. And I was like, damn, like what's happening? We realize two things. First is the concept of negative self- admittance. And so we noticed something that was happening in the VSSL and in the post call flow. people to go through that had to through the copy and messaging that was there before had to admit to themselves that they were poor and stupid to even do this thing to even hop on the call. And this is something Allan talks about a lot is I mean do you have a piece of and I know for you on the weight loss thing like same exact thing like if you have to if a prospect has to admit them to themselves that they're fat and ugly. Guess what? They're not going to show up on a call dude and talk about how ugly and fat they are. They're not going to show up on a call and talk about how poor and stupid they are. They're not going to do that. And so it's the most simple frame shift in the world. Instead of getting negative self- admittance, you do just third party. You talk in third person. So it's like if you have some things that like because sometimes you have to get them to like the negative state, right? If you just talk and say like people who aren't successful, sometimes they do XYZ. People who aren't not if you do XYZ that's why you're unsuccessful. Unsuccessful people who do this behavior, this is why they're unsuccessful, right? And like literally just that frame switch so many times can change the entire paradigm and the entire frame of how you're communicating and immediately it's better. Um, another thing, so that's the first thing is the negative self- admittance. We fixed that led to a really good I think we went from I don't remember the exact number but it was like a pretty good lift just from that. But the second one was very interesting. It wasn't an an objection thing. It was a mindset thing. So they of course we did all the stuff on the VSSL. Here's it's possible. It's probable. You're going to do it. Guess what? There's people forget what they just watched because a lot of the time like they forget, dude. They forget all the time. And so this is like kind of where Jeremy's like or um Yeah. where Jeremy's like hammer them thing comes in obviously. But yeah, exactly. Literally just Yeah. Literally just repeating the points that you made in the VSSL of why this is possible and then probable for you specifically prospect is going to be way better than handling objections, right? because you get them to a mindset state, you kind of have to like keep that really high vibration emotions going on within them where they're like super hyped up that you did through your VSSL. You kind of have to find a way to keep that up. And of course, like as you know on the upside, there's like the postbooking flows and then obviously you can do the hammer them like with the pipelines like all that, etc. But do that instead of just being like how much does this thing cost, right? Like what does the program look like, right? Like here are some student wins, right? Like instead of doing that, like think more about the mindset frameship that you have to instill in someone specifically for B TOC. Specifically for B TOC, especially for B to C. Um B2B way easier. Like literally just give them all the information that they need. Give them everything. Literally just give them everything and then and then you'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I could not agree with you more on the entire on everything you just said. I mean it's all the framing completely. We had a post video that was around cost and it like nuked them. They're also using it in hammer them strategy and it was nuking it and because we were bringing up our theory is because we were bringing up that un thought concern style thing, right? Or like un they just were unaware of that and how we framed it and solved it was like not correct. Uh versus we have another one now that like popped off on organic that we used and then we leveraged there. But that plus we have multiple like you said basically following that script and then the multiple questions pre-objection and then testimonials that are in the frame like you said using third party verifiable result like we did all of those um plus some more tactical [ __ ] for sure but the B2B one you say is so funny to me. I talked about it on here but I booked a call with somebody that I wanted to talk to and it was kind of like I wasn't that interested but someone recommended it and I was like okay I'll just do it. I go on their website, could find some stuff, some testimonials, but they were broad and they were kind of like longer and I was like whatever. Like that's not my exact use case, so I'm not going to watch them. And I literally responded that the schedule page didn't work. This I'm sorry, the scheduled success page didn't work. So there was no like I didn't get redirected from Calendarly and then they sent me an email that says sometimes it doesn't work. Here's the link. I click on the link, it doesn't work then either. I email back and I go send me everything humanly possible you can before this call. And it's B2B, right? And they don't send me anything. and our calls in like 10 minutes and I get an email and it's like here's a testimonial, whatever. I click on it. It's like, hey, I see you asked for resources. I click on it and they had just uploaded to YouTube two minutes prior and I'm like, bro. And like it was helpful like testimonial, but I got on with them and the real thing here is I got on with them and they had such a good offering and such a a fit for what I was looking for that I did end up doing business with them. And it was just funny because I was like, "Guys, you need some love on this process." That was bad. Like bad news. So, That's funny. That's a good sign for them. Yeah, that's a good sign for them. If their offer was so good that they didn't even need those things to convert you, that's kind of a good sign. It's like, dude, the potential is like go to the for sure. But you and I both know you could have the best product in the world and if nobody knows about it or gets to it properly, like, you know, and that's not their goal after talking to them. It's like they don't need this dialed in process because the people who need to make it to them generally come through referral or through this or like organic basically. So, it doesn't matter. They don't need all the DR hacks and texts at this perfect time based on time zone and someone to dial like you don't need that because they don't do the volume. But yeah, it's a that was a really good answer that you had. Yeah. Yeah. Um let next one let bad KPI top spenders spend for top ofunnel or cut them. I think that's just what uh Oh yeah. Yeah. So if you're if you're running ad if you're running an ad um and Facebook is spending on the ad and you have bad KPIs for top of funnel specifically all this should this is relevant for all ah got it got uh or cut them uh yes cut them next question not sure if you do much payer call but I'm so interested on how you generate quality inbounds quality I was gonna say I feel like you kind of touched your way around this already but what would your succinct answer for this be? Yes. So um in the with the repair offer I was buying calls um there were transfer calls so they weren't like direct there were transfer calls from call center to then uh just outbound list like hey are you blah blah blah and then they get transferred over to us. Um so I've dealt with um paper callers like we were going to onboard one who was doing like just pure um just pure like ads to us. I'll be honest, like I'm so unsophisticated when it comes to like the like publishers and like networks and like all that stuff is like I was it was just so like direct partnership like so bare bones. Um and I just eventually I kind of like gave up and I was like dude I can [ __ ] generate these calls myself like why am I not like what am I doing here? And so just started generating calls myself and so I really liked the idea of like click to call because I had done before that I would do intake forum of course is like a quizunnel. I split tested between quizfunnel, see if you see if you qualify, like you know, all those different like intake forms. Um, and then I would have my sales reps like outbound dial them the second like like two minutes after they opted in. And so I'd have them dial them and then start a conversation. That's how I was doing it. Um, and so I learned about paper call and I was just like, "Oh, let me just switch it to short intake form and then button to call someone, right?" So, okay. And so I was doing basically paper call but for myself. So if Yeah. Yeah. So that's what the question. Yeah. Yeah. That's the question. How do you generate inbound quality inbounds? Okay. So, uh number one, don't do any of the insane like grey hat stuff that like the the ACA guys like there's a few other industries where they were just doing like ridiculous like don't do any of that. That if you have to do that that just means that you have a skill issue and you don't know how to sell your own thing. And so you have to tell people that they're getting an EBT card for 500 bucks, right? Because like you can't sell your own thing. So first of all, if you feel the pull to do any kind of gray hat or black hat stuff, stop and realize that you don't have the skill set. So get the skill set. Fix that first because that is not how you are going to build a sustainable business pipeline, anything like that. No one will trust you or respect you. Okay? If you do that, no one who actually matters will respect like black hat stuff. Um so that's first of all. Now, how you generate quality inbounds is very funny because it's like kind of like everything that we've been talking to talking about to this point, which is just how to sell and market period. And so, it very much so depends on the niche. So, um I can talk about repair because that's what I was doing. So, uh and and uh MVA as well, but that was also the intake and then calling them, right? So, first was the uh it was very simple structure. It was just like outcome, right? was like what was the outcome that they wanted and then it was what's the perceived trust level around this thing which was massive for repair because no one no one trust repair like everyone's heard of credit repair everyone thinks that it doesn't work we had a product that actually worked like it was insane it actually worked I was like okay but I can't say trust me this thing works right like same thing in MVA which is also like a big industry for paper call now is like everyone's ran through the angle of like these people are getting rich doing this thing, right? Like everyone's kind of ran through that angle, right? And so if you do that, you're just going to be put into the same trust bucket, right? And so it's kind of difficult because like that is the outcome, right? That is what you're saying, but you have you do have to like kind of switch. And so what I did for repair was I was like, okay, look, people want the outcome. They don't trust anyone, which when when they don't trust a company, they don't trust the process that the company is saying that they'll use. It's as simple as it is. And so I was like, hm, okay, what if instead now I just went so deep on process that they couldn't have a choice but to trust me, right? And so that's what I did. I'm not going to because we do have to run through these. So I'm not going to go like super heavy. Was the same thing I was talking about before problem mechanism using su mechanism like blah blah blah. And then deeper core reason why. No, this is my it's my favorite topic. It's my favorite topic like of all time is that like I'm I'm truly a copywriter in my in my heart. Like I'm just I just I love it. But anyway, um to get the call itself, which is the one thing that's like, wait, why do I need to call like you think it'd be obvious, but again, like some of these some of these markets aren't the most sophisticated in terms of like uh IQ. So like sometimes they don't know why they need to call. You need to actually give them a reason why. And this was the problem with all the grey hats was like call now to get your to get your EBT food stamps, right? Call now to get this XYZ. What I did is going to sound stupid simple, but I kind of took the whole thing for the I was learning from like the B2B funnels, which I ran in like the most the most s like marketing for coaches, right? Like funnel building for co I had to like write copy for those kinds of offers, right? Like super sophisticated, right? So I just took a very simple principle which is what do these people want right now like today which is the concept with the AC funnel right it's like you like the offer that you build when you run an AC funnel is give them something plugandplay right that they can get right now and so when I was running the marketing funnel it was that but it was like ads right I was like get three uh high converting three ads like that are high converting based off of $3 million worth of spend but it's going to be tailored to you so we need to get on a call to understand your offer, right? Basic structure there. So, we weren't these weren't pre-filled. These were custom made for you. And so, I did that and just transferred it over to repair, which was very simple. What do people want? This is where the research comes in because I found out that people that the credit repair market, the people who are credit uh challenged, they don't even know why they're credit challenged. Look on Reddit. They'll be like, "Oh, I have wait I paid this bill off." And I was like, what? Like, why why did my score go down and then up and then B? They don't know. So, oh, this that's simple. Free credit consultation. And then, of course, you have your sexy bullet copy, like really sell the call, like heavy sell the call. And like um uh this guy Matsk on um on Twitter on his email list. He's a he's an info guy. He does like a lot of webinars. And for he's like for selling the webinar like just curiosity over everything like gatekeep like gatekeep heavy but also sell it. And so that's what I was doing for the calls. I did the little timer as like your slot expires in 100 like in a minute and 57 seconds because we're getting a bunch of like all those little tactics. But I had to figure out the call offer itself based off of what people were questioning and what questions people had in that market. Like what do they really want to know right now? And this was so important to them that like it it crushed like it crushed. It genuinely crushed. And I was getting I think Yeah, I like that. Yeah, it was it was not sustained, but for a week I had $10 calls. Yeah, it wasn't sustained, but for a week I had No, no, no, no. But for a week and we're and we were spending it was like at scale in terms of like it was like decent spend, but for a week we had like $10 calls and it was fantastic. But like it it crushed. And so that's how I would generate like quality inbounds. It's like stop doing all this like weird like external stuff. Like make it about your offer and figure out what questions that they have and what do they want right now. Right. For example, local um I told my uh my buddy of mine runs a um a lawn care business down here in South Florida and he was running a funnel. It was like everyone's just like the get your free quote, right? And he did the dumbest thing. So simple. It was just see exactly how much your dream lawn costs. You think it's the same thing. It's not literally just that switch. 30% lower uh cost per call. Just that switch. And so it's cra like I said like that's why I love copy because I I think it's like the number one lever. I truly do. People say offer. I kind of agree. I agree. Offer is number one. we can kind of all agree to that. After that, it is literally copy because it's just that frame switch, right? And so, yeah, just figure out what people want. If you're running, you know, if you're running um if you're running calls in like whatever market you're in, this is this is depending like it you can do this in any any market, any vertical that you're in. Just figure out what people actually want and then deliver that and then deliver how you're going to give them that, right? Which I won't get too specific. I like that. I like the how as I mean yeah you've layered that in a couple times and I I just keep thinking of examples how we can use that in other offers of guys I know that I'm like oh that's pretty obvious like but it's not you think so you'd think so it's been obvious for 60 years because the most famous marketer of all time David Ogiel he literally says reason why marketing that's his whole thing like we're still forgetting that because I think at this point we've gotten so I think it's been so diluted down we're all following the same formulas by the same guru that were popularized 20 years ago and we're still using them because we're terrified of messing up, right? Because our client's going to fire us, right? Like we think that this thing has worked okay for now and so I'm just not going to change it, right? And so it's like a game of telephone. Like it's like the actual like the actual principles just get diluted like you know. But yeah, that's my answer. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, that's a solid one. Um, next one on here, I don't know if this is relevant for you, but Tik Tok organic funnel the Telegram offer. Oh yeah. Like do you do like you see all these guys that do Tik Tok organic pretty heavily. I mean let's just talk that part in general. Yeah. Yeah. So I know the um he mentioned he literally mentioned Young Indian Method. I know the guy who started that which is the most hilarious name of any program I've ever heard. Young Indian Method. But I I know him and so um we talked because he needed some help on like the paid side and so he just ran me through the organic side on Tik Tok. Um he kind of to really win on Tik Tok like to really win like there are some organic offers info offers that just pop the hell off and like there were like the really like the control in that industry for the format itself. You do have to innovate on the format itself. So like he innovated on like a it was like a meme slideshow format where it was like POV uh yeah it was like a text sorry it was a text thread my bad it was a text thread between his Indian employee which was just I'm sure just him and his friend like actually making these formals his Indian employee and it was like hi sir can you please give me raise to 50 cents an hour and then the 50 cents yeah 50 cents an hour and the response was like um no you're not worth that much keep working Jeet or something crazy like that. And it was like obviously it was like very like cuz you were kids who was buying this program, right? But like he just rinsed that format forever until it stopped working and then the whole offer stopped working because yeah like that's what that's what was getting and he couldn't innovate for he like more he just got really lucky on that like actual format of the thing that really worked. I would say you can do that. A lot of it is luck. I mean, if you're like really entrenched in organic, which I'm not, you kind of know the the formats that perform organically. I was actually gonna ask you this question because you were talking about how you wanted to go hard with organic. Uh, what do you think about clipping? Yeah, I mean I there's different ways to play that game, right? Where it's like one is the content in general and it's like are you dedicated creating it? Is that a whole another job for said content creation or AIing or whatever? or do you have stuff that's long that you can turn into shorts that actually do it and different people have different opinions. I've seen and again this is not our game so this is like my theory around this or what I've heard. Um you know the ones that create them dedicated supposedly do better a lot of the time than the you know Gary Vee example taking something long and cutting it short. I don't think that's necessarily always true but maybe a higher hit rate. Um but the big thing for us is the distribution side of it. So you have like the creation and then you have the distribution. So distribution you have people like Iman who control the assets and like yes it does spread beyond that but you control the narrative where you are controlling the actual distribution accounts which requires a team or whatever agency or someone to do that whole portion of it not just farm it out on [ __ ] content rewards. I think the difference there is like the control you have is huge and how the narrative goes or swings one way because they lean into whatever pocket starts to get it and like if it if that's not back to our thing about like congruency or you know you have a lander that says you win a free cruise versus you have a lander that says it's the hardest thing ever like one's going to get way higher optin or views or whatever. Um, and if it maybe hits different or a clip is different in a way that maybe doesn't serve what the true goal is, which is to get converting high ticket customers, let's say in our example. Um, that can be an issue. So, it's like who's the audience it lands on and what is the message that maybe hits the virality or the or spreads that maybe is either clipped out of context or is right. So, you just kind of play that game. Um, I'm a fan. I think the model itself makes a ton of sense. You've seen the guys who crushed it for the fame side more or less or like the the increased following and then converted that because they were the right audience or they built an offer that fit that audience is maybe even a way to say it. Yeah. But for us because our offer structure is relatively fixed uh and the demo is relatively fixed in that way like that's the only concern is the control of who the audience becomes and then how we choose to do distribution. I don't worry about the creation because we have the bandwidth to do that and we have so much that we can repurpose that was either directly built for it or can truly be repurposed. Um, but yeah, that's kind of like I'm down for it. It's just like when and then also having something that's likely more mass market for offer that can convert uh versus that's the other that's like the affiliate issue. That's the virality issue is when your mechan like or your your process is includes like calls for example you have 48 hours of booking availability for 200 spots and the second you hit some viral moment and that's the only way through not a direct to cart not a some xyz uh you're burning that fame or viral like viral moment and you're breaking the business because of the spike and like that's been an issue with us talking about with affiliates. So someone's going to mail their 2 million person list. It's like we'll get filled in whatever. Let's just say it's just for ease. Let's say it's 100 bookings. Like as soon as you hit that, the next 400 that try are like buried in this mess and then you're trying to get setters and like is the quality there from this one source or is it like piece and parted and like you don't know those variables. So we that's the reason we've kind of stayed away from it thus far. Um not to say that we won't over time or once we have direct to cart. I think direct to cart that like crushes that then has that kind of audience like mass appeal whether it's affiliate or clip or whatever like I think that'll make more sense for us. Um but still same fear there is if you bring someone into low ticket just because they can buy low ticket but the low ticket person is not somebody who ascends into high ticket it breaks the whole model anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Interesting. Okay. So you want to have control over the actual content that's being first of all that's being actually distributed. So like you can't do the Tate like affiliate model, right? Where it's like you just give them whatever here's a million clips like you clip it up, you do XY and then if you were the Yeah, maybe you could if you were the one clipping it directly and maybe you even could with the long form where someone finds it. Like people have asked to do it for me. Let's use me as an example. like they've been like, "Oh, can we do this?" or "Oh, you should use this," whatever. And it's like my goal is, and I say in all these videos, is like to build an audience, network, whatever, in this pretty like hyper niche zone that are mid6 figure, seven figure a month guys that or guys and gals, right, that are that I can find talent through and with as well as the audience of people and then that I can get opportunities for deals or whatever comes upon into the future. And then really, it's just the network. It's like meet people like you and be able to have these conversations to be able to be in DM and it's like, "Oh, I just found this cool thing." Or me shooting something over to you and like I just never had that. Um, so when someone says, "Hey, I want to clip your stuff and get you to like, you know, 100K in the next month." It's like I don't know that there's 100,000 people. I don't know the number or the TAM or what it really is, but like you know, my game is not like, oh, let's just increase the numbers necessarily as much as it is like let's find the right pockets of people. And I don't know, I don't know how sat saturated I am on that right now. like the numbers go up, but like at what point am I at saturation where it's like the top kind of people or whatever people I want to really hang out with. There's the education play that's like just helping people who are maybe, you know, at other zones and just doing it for free. I like it's nice and it's fun to talk through, but does the audience exist? Uh beyond that inside where those audiences and shorts and stuff live with someone who maybe has shorter attention span, I sit here and talk for 20 minutes straight about Yeah. the call reminder sequence like you know what I Like that's only going to hit for somebody like seriously like it's only going to hit for somebody that it hits with. And that's kind of the point. I could do 10 times better and all these people [ __ ] [ __ ] on me because they're like, "Oh, you don't do this and you're like marketer." And one, I'm not a marketer. And two, uh I know I know what the game is. I kind of know what the game is supposed to be and I do this much of it. And it's like clipping is one of those things on the list. Gotcha. I can um I I'll connect you like after this. Um, I can connect you to a guy who um, we are going to because I have like an ecom project on the side who we're going to be using as like a clipping agency. Um, I think he came in through like Eddie Cumberbatch's like clipping agency bisop which is really embarrassing for him but he actually does really good work and he will it's kind of embarrassing bro but he um, he does both like where he'll you can control the content but you also get the benefit of the distribution. So it's like kind of splitting the diff. So I can like shoot him over um, shoot you over his Twitter like afterwards. I know the [ __ ] guys. as well. And they've talked about how like you see the people who blast them on X about it and oh, it got this or they're allowing X content, but like they also have like a really innovative thing kind of built where they have the, you know, it it's cool. It is cool. And I think you can limit certain audiences and there are going to be mess ups and like it's tech and it's whatever and people are going to play play the system. But like I think what those guys side tangent what those guys are building is very cool. It's clearly like, you know, Young Money Twitter vibe and stuff and but like I think as they continue to grow and maybe expand beyond that, like they're going to be a beast and they're just playing the game right now. But it's Yeah, absolutely. And they got the and they got the VC capital to back. So they're going to do Yeah, they got the VC capital and they got the names. They got they got the names now with, you know, Iman to own info coaching game with them. Yeah. So yeah. Cool. Um these next two hooks angles already did that. sauce on biz loan offers. Already kind of did that. Next one. Franchise franchise bisop offer. What does that mean? Uh yes. So I made a post on it was the smartest info. Um actually here let me just bring this up. Sorry once more. There's about an info offer here. Anyone who's still here 2.5. We keep doing this at the perfect breaks. Okay. Yeah. The smartest info offer uh owner I know to switch his entire business to a franchising model. So he's kind of swiped the economics from EXP realy. Um full incentive alignment between him and his customer franchise franchisee 10x higher ACV just longer across longer time horizon lesson in there. So he's doing something where it's like an MLM but it's not actually. So, if I take it, because I'm not about to dox them because it's genuinely a really crazy model, but let's say you run an agency like how to start your own agency thing, right? Instead of selling a course on how to start your own agency, you license out your agency model. You he charges people for the program and the knowledge and the implementation, but he has like you don't have to worry about fulfillment. You don't have to worry about taking sales calls. We'll do all that. You generate pipeline, you generate calls, book meetings. Here's how you can do that. And then the course goes there, right? And then it's we'll compensate you. So he he gets paid first on the front end for charging people on how to do that, but then he takes I think it's 5 to 10%. Right? So he'll he'll give 95% of whatever to that person, right? And he'll keep like 10% or or whatever like what I think that was his thing. He has some compensation structure of like how he compensates them versus like what he keeps and it has to be like congruent. We'll see how this holds up at scale if he gets to scale it. Um, but this guy, this is a guy who this is one of those like top ClickBank offer guys, right? Like this is this is one of those dudes. He's like actually one of the smartest info offer rooms I know. This could be he's schizophrenic or like he has dementia right now or it could be the greatest idea of all time. We'll see. But yeah, this is I didn't realize that's what this question meant. And I could talk on this for the next two hours and we have 27 minutes left because I have a hard stop. But the dude this is so much top of mind for me right now that I probably use the wrong words but these are the ones I keep using about how the fulfillment model and the monetization model can be so different across the vast like across so for his example right let's say so he's doing call it group coaching or it's basically it's a course plus you know probably whatever either oneto ones or group coaching calls is the classic thing most people are going to use the monetization model of either lifetime access for five grand or whatever they're going to use maybe something where there's continued coaching so there's either a backend something or they're going to have it right off the rip as it's 5 grand to start and then 2k a month like these different options right that's like 99.99% of people's monetization model I have been vastly searching this and hearing some crazy [ __ ] on how people do this all the way to like think of the nth degree that you can take it and this is exactly what I was talking to you about about how you structure not the fulfillment of you doing everything, but the monetization play of how you do everything because instead the deal structure can go as far as like if it's a business that has some term some sort of exit value can be equity. It can be the next back which is probably profit share. The one before that is probably rev share. Like you go down the tanches and those two can kind of flip depending on where the margins sit. But like all the way back to where like someone either doesn't even pay you because you're learning while earning to you're making five or 10 grand a month retainer to you're making performance pay rev or this to like you have equity. Now, yeah, the difference on that in the fulfillment model, this is like so top of mind, is how you service it in in tandem to how you're paid on it because you got to think of the highest leverage possible is very likely going to be one of these percents, whether it's equity, profit, uh, equity, profit share, or rev share. how you fulfill on it. Whether it's your time, whether it's a course, whether it's coaches or you coaching, whether it's group co, like the top top top tier example, I heard of this, the guy makes multiple eight figures uh a year, has equity positions in a ton of these companies and does fulfillment through group coaching calls. So, you have you're an in you basically Yes. Yes. Think about this. So, you have twice a week, you have two hour blocks, let's say. So you have four hours of time that you're spending for your fulfillment is that okay the monetization instead of charging five grand a month or whatever to access this guy's time in a group coaching setting not one to one which is the highest leverage. Yeah. He then has equity as his monetization play. So these are all exitable businesses. They're like in the software e game. So he has equitable things where he literally gives his time through group instead of onetoone. And think about the leverage of that right? you have this much time and then you have the biggest backend possible because these are equitable business like companies that could sell you go the next step further or like backward I guess and it's like okay how do you do it in group or onetoone setting that's likely like revshare I talked to a guy in here that takes x percentage of rev share because they have such a good model and they deploy like one or two people right so that's like kind of the the the more time inensive or cost intensive one because you have to pay people or your time is all scattered you're working on all these things he get all the way to the degree to where he just has to work these four blocks. And of course, I'm sure there's a million other things and this is like I'm oversimplifying this I'm sure on his involvement, but like that for the highest return possible. Crazy. That's nuts. I've never in my life heard of equity for group coaching. Yeah, dude. People I mean, think about it. It's like who makes sense though. It makes sense though. Yeah. Yeah. the most extreme like would you give like I you know I don't know the details of the hormosi models but like you know you hear equity things you hear rev shares you hear all these things like that is they they you know I again I don't know enough of their model but like theirs could be something like that or it could be a leading team that they deploy in but like it could be as simple he has enough leverage where he could do that of course so crazy wow you can get so creative with this stuff you can get so creative with that and that's kind of where I'm trying to dance and we're late enough in this I can talk about this. But like that's what I'm kind of like cooking because I have so many cool opportunities that are coming and like we need to stay focused on the main thing is the main thing. So that's one main reason where I'm not like oh I want to go launch this thing but like there's just so much opportunity and cool businesses I see that I like want to help but like and I do just kind of help for free right now and I say on the channel like I don't sell anything. I don't sell anything and like I want to stay in that land of like I don't sell anything in terms of that but like there may be some version of a play that's monetization method of that style thing and like coaching instead not deployment not I'm in your stuff I'm in doing this and this and like clicking keys but like maybe in time when there's enough pent up or I find the right partner maybe that is like already kind of that person where I can just like we can co-do it. I don't know. That would be that that's that's something that's attractive to me because of the model and the upside. Do you think that do you think that's more of like an auxiliary thing to what you're doing now or do you think that's the next like step up auxiliary? Um well it just depend. Yeah. I mean like it would definitely start as auxiliary just cuz like I would want to feel it but I we talked about this a lot uh internally but it's like at what scale or size like because we have so many so much horsepower within sea level and then also us like there's there is overlap um where we love this we loved working we love the like the game sounds so stupid but like I just like building stuff and like skill leveling up so I see it as probably the same amount of work just in what vehicle. So it's like how much time do we allocate to this or and the other thing is like at at certain scale and size ideally we get to where it's like machine enough that it does a lot of these pieces and you don't need to be on it 10 hours a day every day seven days a week like and but if you want to work your 10 or 12 hours you want to be on a computer and you can do that better and probably do like you know I'm bad with time management but like let's just say it's that it can be half your time and there's definitely the play is this shiny object is this this and this and I don't really know um but the goal would be to get this thing up to where it's like machine, it's growing, you can own your portion because we have these other, you know, co-owners and leads and performance pay people that really own their own zone to where like you're almost in their way if you're doing things. So if we do that correctly then yeah the time requirement and then your head is in free space and is that cool because you're thinking of these way bigger things to take this one further or does this one have its kind of natural trajectory of XYZ and then there is time to kind of noodle around on this or just that's why I'm saying like almost with a partner because I think it'd be cleaner with that or someone um because yeah I just I just think that would be cleaner external to this. Um, I don't know though. We'll see how that all all shores out and like I'm not in any rush to do any of that necessarily, but there's definitely opportunity for it. Yeah, that's that's you just gave me some perspective there because I was I was going to I was like that's interesting, but I was kind of skeptical about like the original post that I was talking about of that guy like with the franchise thing. But like yeah, there's a guy who's doing Yeah, it's just the online version of it, right? I mean, like if he has a really good model, it's the same thing as like the licensing model like we talked about in the video. I keep mentioning him, but like I consume a lot of his content. I think I like how he thinks through things and like the framework, but he talked about how the reason Jim Launch sold was essentially it was licensing and because the recurring portion and the you know recurring revenue that was around them basically producing ads at their cost, testing ads on their cost and then finding winners and giving that to them as like just the very bare bones. They have all the other stuff, the info, the coaching, the education, all the stuff around it. But like that piece as like a deliverable that was recurring inside there was a big piece of like why people would stay, right? They were licensing those materials. So in this exact example, a franchise, which there's a big difference, and I'm not a franchise person, but there's like three things I think that make a franchise and like if you hit all three, you get like screwed and you have to be under franchise law versus licensing where if you one or two, I think is I think is how it works. I don't know. Not an expert. Um, but it's that model. It's like if you already built it, then you get either same thing monetization model. If you're a franchise, you're getting a percent. If you're not franchise and you're licensing, you get generally 2K a month that they pay in recurring to access the stuff. And it's like a differentiator there. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, I mean I it makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah, I wanna I want to explore that with you a I want to explore that with you like more now, but I know we still have some questions. But we'll we're definitely going to talk after this because I have some ideas. I'm sure there'll be round two of this. I'm sure there'll be around too. I don't know how to do these long ones though without this being like very difficult for someone to follow along with. Do you know the gist of this one? Yeah. Yeah. So, this one I have no idea. Um I wanted Okay. Something Yeah. Yeah. Also, it's black hat. Don't do black hat. Okay. That's my answer right there. Selling lead flow. Next one is is kind of too selling lead flow in tricky niches when companies aren't listing affiliate programs publicly and gaining access to deals that are publicly available. Uh also affiliate offers a second. I am not I'm not an affiliate. I I some people think that I'm an affiliate because I'm like direct response. I'm not an affiliate. Um not the not the guy to ask this question. Uh wish I knew the answer. So sorry. Wish I knew the answer. I do not. No idea. Not affiliate guy. Sorry, man. Yeah, I have I actually have some context for this one, which is interesting. Okay, who would have thought? Who would have thought? Um, and this is probably not what he's asking, but one of the examples of this is when I was running with those media buyer guys, uh, they crush twoman team. They are killers. They do massive spends and one is like kind of more business strategy taught the other one and then now the other one is like the full-time, you know, 20our a day media buyer, sicko, like just in it. Um, but they will do really cool stuff that they do a lot of paper call. They do everything like they'll find a pocket and like hit it, but they have their kind of like more evergreen stuff and they will do really cool things. It's not really affiliate offer necessarily stacking um but like lead genen stacking where they will take you know the basic stuff like oh they're going to run 247 but during these hours that are XYZ of call it is going to it's going to the call and then this other thing on the back end whatever. Then on off hours, it's the same type of flow where you're maybe getting a way less call because it's in the 247 center, which is, you know, lower um whatever RPCs. And then on the back, they have these form fills that like more than liquidate it. So they take that form fill as a true form fill when during the day they wouldn't take it as a form fill because they can route it. You're not they're not like, you know, they're doing exclusives, so they're not doing doubles, but the others you are allowed to do that. So, it's more it's more so like taking the same funnel and like squeezing it more for 247 coverage versus that. So, they get their like really high over here, but they they make profit still on these like off hours, but they do it in like a different way. I thought that was interesting. And then also some of the stuff with uh how they'll again I don't know if this is stacking as much as this is routing but they'll do stuff similar to that where they have really good direct deals and partnerships not like through networks um that they will route based on um or based off of uh that they can like dupe out. So they'll again have certain things that are exclusive that they won't that'll come through and then they'll have like super I mean these guys are like white hat like really good at what they do. Um and so they follow all the rules. Um, but they will they'll do stuff like that where if they have exclusive versus not exclusive, they can take the form data and do that or they can route through. And I'm like, "Oh, that's pretty interesting because they they monetize it in multiple ways. Someone who fits this bucket also fits this bucket and they have the compliance checks and stuff to make sure that they're allowed to do that which I thought was interesting." And so are those guys selling they're selling two different offers to kind of like the same like list like the same input traffic but two different offers. Yeah. Okay. And I'm like complimentary offers. Okay. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It's like I mean imagine you're running you know let's use simple examples but like ACA and debt right like you have filling out certain things around like how much credit or whatever where you sit on this you can also route them for the other as long as you have like the correct relationship or the correct thing um but it just brings that overall blended number blended blended blender up which then is the true number you're looking at right you spent 100 grand you make 110 but now you make 115 it's like that's a lift that's a real lift that you can have margin for error in other zones So yeah. Yeah, that one that's actually affiliates with affiliate version of this. I've seen people go ham with again I don't really know what they mean by stacking as much as like multi- hit like I've people crush crush doing capture on affiliate and then using that email list and then splitting the list like take it like to the nth degree. It's like they're hammering them with multi offer. They're then hitting them with upsell on it because they have backend to the affiliate as well. So then they are part of the uh the rev on the back and then they also will do things where they split the list and then have completely dedicated personas. It's kind like like the decision tree just goes likeoop and then it just keeps going and keeps going and keeps going. Add infinite items. It's crazy. Yeah. Know there's some guys who are absolutely cracked. And actually to to answer I didn't think about this before which is funny but brain is kind of getting fried right now. I need my adal. I don't know where my dealer is bro. Um, for that I was I was literally buying with the credit repair thing. I was literally buying debt settlement leads. I gave them a script of like, hey, here's what you can say because it was like an inactive list, right, of people who like didn't pick up during whatever window. Like there wasn't enough concurrencies or whatever during that time. So I could like take those I could take that list have them activated with a script that I wrote myself of like, hey, like if your credit's blah blah blah and you have XYZ debt, we can actually get that removed, etc. And then Yeah. So yeah, if you were the affiliate who ran that traffic, then you could sell it to someone like me or you could pitch it to someone like me. Um because I had that idea, but I'm sure a lot of companies don't have those ideas or at least haven't materialize them and you can just sell that if you're an affiliate, especially in paper call if you're like Yeah, that a quote that I like from Hormosi where he talks about like how else like what you talked about the un untapped monetization or or what you call it hidden monetization method. Hidden hidden economics. That's from Allen. That's how he describes it. I like that. Yeah. No, dude. We're all just We're all just distilling somebody um at this point in life, I think. But um the he talks about how having partnerships on the back, like simple example, but you sell it over to the chiropractor that's next door because you do some back something where it's like an ecom thing, but you sell it to this. Um, and his quote on that was, "Be okay with only getting whatever CPA basically that you're getting from them, uh, up until you figure out that they're making more money than you are for your leads and then you're in the wrong business." And I'm like, that's a very interesting like, you know, we have that, right, where we could we could farm stuff out to to the HRT or the this or the that or whatever. And it's like we don't want to play the game on purpose, but like I'm going to be, let's be real, like I saw that guy post the CAC to LTV multiples on some of these industries and it's like crazy. And I'm like, but that's just not our game on purpose. But a lot of these guys that probably is their game. And there's a very easy way to do that with partnerships and data selling and stuff that again I don't know the clients on this. So like do your own research because we don't do this. But like there's a lot of hidden economics. Oh yeah. Speaking of cacti, I saw I saw a dashboard from uh on tellah health and I was just like what the [ __ ] Yeah, give me so much FOMO. So much FOMO. Let's ignore it. I know guys in PR that were doing ecom that literally just dropped it all and went into tellahalth because they saw the numbers and just cook. Yeah, just cook. Yeah. Yeah. I think isn't stealth. I don't know. I think he talked I think I've heard him talk about it but I don't know enough about his stuff. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's crazy though. Um, next one we got on here. Add creatives for every type of platform that No, I don't like that one. Uh, how are your tracking analytics on the paid side? I have a disconnect figuring out my CPA for high ticket products from paid. Oh, I got this, too. I'm disorganized here. How do you do this? Okay. So, I'm going to say mine first and then you're going to embarrass me with your answer. Um so so due to the fact that I didn't have to build a lot of the things that I did from scratch um especially on the SAS side like we had a data science team and the stuff that they did was as far as rocket science that I could ever like I looked at like some of like the the models that they use and I was like Jesus Christ the only thing that I could do was they would just tell me hey here's the data this is what this looks like figure out a way to get this up but they actually had the visibility My stuff is as simple as you could get. My source of truth is always like me. Like that's like my number one thing. Like if you forget like attribution, you forget like all the just one like one blended metric like because it sounds like this guy. I have a disconnect figuring out my CPA for high ticket products from paid. How much have you paid and how much contribution dollars did you generate? And then how much revenue did you generate? It's kind of like there you go. Right. That's that's the answer that question. Um and then you have that distilled down based off of how many channels you're doing. So, how much did you spend through Facebook? Okay. How much did you make from Facebook attributable revenue? And I am not the guy to talk to about attribution models. You would cook me here. Um, I have tried I've done like the data driven. I've done like the last click, first click. Like I keep I keep my like Facebook attribution windows like on the default, right? Like I do um it's just default attribution. So, I I couldn't tell you. It's because we were primarily on Facebook. And what I care about more is since I'm a copyright, I care more about what ad and messaging kind of like converted to the sale versus and so that's as simple as just having creative IDs and making sure that you're tagging every prospect that came through like with like your unique link tracking and all that stuff. Having the tags in the CRM is as basic as that. Um and then that's as much as I do on the analytics. I want to see okay this ad spent this ad spent 200 generated you know a thousand in pipeline in actual like ACV this ad generated you know spent 200 and it generated 1 1500 what are the differences between the ads that could have contributed to that ACV let me cross reference the actual sales call recording and like the forum data and then maybe I'll make some lead scoring model right um now what I'm getting into right now which oh my god please help me with this um we'll talk about this after I'm trying to do cohort reportbased like lifts. So I want to see cuz obviously when you're in lead genen, it's not just like your first seven days, right? It's not like all performance-based. You have 30, 60, 90, one, 120 day lift on a thing because of whatever activity that you have in there. Like all your sales reps are going through your pipeline. So I want a way to do cohort based so I can attribute certain behaviors that we did on the sales enablement side. Maybe like a new retargeting campaign, whatever. Cool. Cohort. uh May 1st through 7th had 30% 90day lift because we did this thing versus cohort May 7th through 14th had XYZ lift because we did this thing now, right? Um which I know I was looking I know there's a way to do that on HubSpot. I think it's like technically kind of whatever. Um but yeah, that's my answer there. Now please cook me. There's no cooking to be had. I know I mean the call side of it. So a lot of things. So the for lead genen, let's start there. So the guys that I was running marketing tech basically like they're just friends like I was just building this stuff out and I was learning while doing it. So I was just happy to do it and that was just like a fun game. And for them there there's different games to be played where if you're getting paid CPA you're getting paid you know on whatever hurdle on a call if you're getting paid on these different things. number one thing. So, they're running on Red Track. All those tools work, the volume, the red track, this that, the other things for this model of lead genen because all you're doing is just making sure that click ID just carries through everywhere and it goes everywhere it possibly goes. And again, this is a one. This is singular. This is not built for omni. Oh, they clicked on my this and this and this and this and where did they go from here to this is not what this is built for. This is built for like this is what they clicked. This is the action they took. And then how far can you carry that click ID throughout? So they then get on a call, it's pushed and it's inside Ringba now. They then are inside Ringba and it goes to whoever else's retriever account for the actual buyer, let's say. Then it's in uh there and it goes to their CRM for their ACA. And then in 7 days from now they actually place a policy or in 30 60 days they get paid on it or whatever. and setting up triggers all the way over there to come back to the beginning with time stamp with whatever like with what you need of the conversion and what type and the amount and everything is like the long tail version of that and they're going to come in in four different places and all that but like you're kind of not going to care. Let's be like in that model. Um and that's how that's how we were doing it for that. So we that's how we knew the actual pay amounts the all that. Um and we would bring that back generally to red track. It's like what layer do you want to bring it? Right? You have like your ads, you have your say meta, you have which has its pixel on thing, you have your red track which houses all of your initial and then you have all these other systems it goes to that have actions that need to come back into red track. So you at least can see there and then it's up to you to decide if you then want to cook the pixel on that because then you can send in you can have custom conversions in here of things you know that you choose not to bring to Facebook. Uh you can have things you choose, right? So that's how we did on the lead genen side of things and there's a million other better ways I'm sure to do it but that was like the clean way with what we do with the call funnel the different funnel. So what you said about HubSpot is you're just going to store as much data as possible on your own side. Uh, and that can be custom, that can be within HubSpot, that can be custom plus HubSpot or whatever. That can also be high roast. Um, and it can be a mix of all those, right? So, you're going to store everything inside there as much as possible, including like ad ids and all that. And then you're going to have those all inside on basically server side, which is what Hyros does, right? It does its own version of server side. You do your own version of server side, whatever. Just pick a source of truth. And then the big thing like what you said is like the reporting that exists within a HubSpot where you have someone opted in on this date and you know the ad ID or whatever. Sure. But then the bigger thing is like knowing the time too of these other pieces like you said your cohorts because then you have an application date, you have a booking date, you have a booked for date, you have a close date and then these ones recycle because they book a second call or they do this. But you can build out all that reporting inside HubSpot to know like your time too of things. And then you can layer it in by add attribution or whatever. And then also all of this is going into Hyros which is the one that I found so far is the most beautiful view of your multi-touch because that's the issue is when you get the attribution models like scientific generally speaking is like what most people are going to base off 30-day there. It's like what initially got it within the generalized window of how long it takes someone which you need to track for them to go from lead to right from first click to close. So if it's within 30 days, you're going to use scientific 30, let's just say, and you're going to run it on that. And that one chose the best journey because if not, you have to build something custom that looks at your hubspot data and is like this and this and this and they clicked on these pages and like it's just Hyros is so clean for that. Um, but to go like a little deeper, we don't use HubSpot or I'm sorry, uh, Hyros for cooking the pixel. We use a custom setup for that just because it has better matching and like cleanliness. So we are kind of doing like making decisions on this data but like feeding based on this data which I kind of don't love in alignment and we'll see where that navigates over time but this tool that's custom eventually probably could just look like hyros because it has all the touch points so you could just do it but they just don't have a good viewer right now so I don't like it because I like to see. So yeah I mean we're saying we're saying the same thing. Okay. Is that tool Don't don't have to share everything, but is that tool um kind of a hybrid of kind of like an out of the box like kind of white glove thing that you had to customize or was it like fully fully custom built from the ground up like internal for the feeding the pixel? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We used essentially Yeah. We used a service of contract guys that basically came in and you know built it out for us, tested things and for us it was that's when we also moved to native events because we weren't on there forever and their big thing is matching. So like they're like these two charts need to perfectly match for server and uh browser. So it was like an absolute dance to make it so that the server ones that came in were in alignment with what was actually happening on page because of in callunnel or whatever you don't know which then all like it it's multi-touch. It's all over the place. Um and then same thing with the routing is making sure like you can do it very simply where it's like if they answer this route them to this page. If they answer this route them to this page but then you have two different calendarly booking widgets or you're passing in hidden fields. you're doing that kind of stuff and then how those actually back out into units is where we then also solve for browser and server on purchase through a Zoom or phone or whatever where which is crazy because the person isn't filling out the information, right? So, how do you get the browser, right? So, like the person has to be doing the action on the device. Yeah. So, we we built it out to where we have customized terms pages that they sign that's included in the purchase, but they fill those out and that's actually what fires the server side. Um, yeah. So, it's like we get we get the I'm sorry, the browser and the server side. So, they fill out that form, they fill in all the information that's basically like a purchase. It is a purchase, but it's post purchase. And they'll go to that one time. So, you can't just throw it in a membership site and fire your purchase every 12 seconds when someone loads page. You have to do it on something that's one time but post-purchase slash into the purchase process. So we do that and then you're going to feed every you're going to then do a lookup of all that information in HubSpot. You're gonna have all your server side information of the initial attribution, the initial click, the init ad ID, the everything plus all the other information you've gathered and you can send the most full picture beautiful as a server side event the second that that thing fires off on browser. I'm gonna when this launches I'm going to replay this in that entire portion that you just said about 10 times. Yeah, there are people raw with server side only uh and have nothing on page for high ticket backend purchase and [ __ ] probably cook us on rorowaz. So like that's just a thing that we are doing and like are trying to optimize for. But like yeah is it necessary? No. Did we run it and do 60 whatever million before we made that change? Yes. like did we use customer conversions and what like I don't know where I stand on that still to this day but I know that people have had really good success with it on low ticket because of the matching is so much better. The high ticket stuff is still questionable in my opinion on like this delay and like it sounds like it should be better and you're giving them the right feed the right information at the better like the accurate times um and the more full picture but I just don't know if that's actually the case. I mean, yeah. Too many variables to say, "Oh, we changed that and that's what made everything better." Yeah. I think I found you were talking about like the hiring a kid who just like work basically my little slave and then I'll teach him some stuff about my stuff and he'll just like just just do stuff for me. That was that was me, by the way. That was me applying for Luke. That was literally Luke saying, "I'm going to teach someone all marketing, sales, funnels, copy, all this." And I booked a call on his calendar and built sales pages for him every six like and got paid a thousand bucks every six weeks. And next thing you know, we're like business partners fully in this and then we're a call funnel and then we're here. So like I don't d that grind. I love that grind. It's just like me too. That was me too. Yeah. Yeah. It just cost person more to do it. Exactly. Yeah. You're right. Because you have to spend time training. I think hormones was talking about that too. Like I'll work for free isn't an offer for you for for the person because they have to spend their very high value time training you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I want to I want someone who understand I need to understand this stuff because that's mark ops and that's really where I'm lacking. Yeah. Um, do you do only affiliate or have your own? No. What traffic source? No. Everyone pushes outbound. Okay, let's do this. Everyone pushes outbound lead genen hard for professional services. So, PE investment banking private credit. If you want to use media buying, how would you structure a campaign when targeting established B2B? What is that different from consumer? So I think you kind of talked about this with callfunnel uh and like B2B versus B TOC, but just the top portion. So everyone pushes outbound lead genen for those services, but how would you do inbound? So I'll talk to you about my experience running ABM campaigns for um for for the enterprise portion of the SAS company that I was in. So we had like a PLG motion. Um it was kind of like they kind of eventually like shut it down because they realized like oh [ __ ] like just our activation. It was a free trial pl 14-day trial and then they were hoping to like ascend them and like I did some work on the activation rate like it it was decent but their whole goal was like same thing like here with your info product it was like ascension rate into like the enterprise plans just was not working and this is the case with like 90% of SAS um PLG like PLG motions and so I transitioned to working on the enterprise side we had a director of demand genen who was like an absolute wizard with like ABM campaigns so I'm going to say this. I'm going to preface now. Anyone like for like if you ask the question, look up accountbased marketing, go on to LinkedIn, look up guys like Chris Walker. Like if you're in like act like SAS SAS, like either VC backed or if you're bootstrap or like you're just in the SAS world, look up the guy. His name is Chris Walker. He has a podcast called Revenue Vitals. Listen to him religiously. He's like he does exclusively nine and 10 figure SAS companies. Like he exclusively works with them and he gives you all the sauce. look him up because what I'm about to say is probably outdated number one and probably I don't remember everything number two that was the biggest like these deal sizes were like3 to9 million contracts and they would like sell them out on a contract basis like 12 to 24month contracts and they're worth like anywhere between like three and nine it was like only established like enterprise stuff and so we would do ABM whereas accountbased and we'd use a platform um kind of like a I think it's demand sense I think they changed it but it's basically like a demand like we'll give you information on what companies are one visiting your website and two searching for XYZ thing. So basically it's just like market intelligence. So like these companies are currently looking for XYZ solution, right? Or these companies are searching up this right or these companies are engaging with XYZ content, right? And they kind of fed you that list. And so then what we would do is we would run either like we ran a um a webinar funnel which is it was this was the funniest thing to me is like seeing a webinar funnel work in enterprise like 3 to9 million contract SAS and then also info like l like webinars are everywhere in B2B SAS but we we ran like a webinar event um targeting the full account so you have it's kind of like a waterfall thing so you have your your like decision makers which are usually not like your seuite but they're maybe like VP PS and managers and like product leads and all like stuff like that. So like we had to understand who within that account list we wanted to target because they could one make the decisions very important and then two understood the problem enough to push for that problem to be solved. This is like a problem that I ran across was targeting the wrong person. I would go for the VP like yeah they had buying power they just weren't close enough to the problem to actually want to solve it. Right. Like right that's like it was so huge. I was like well duh. And so we had to build out like our actually target list and then from there it was very simple. We would run uh we would run like custom audience uh campaigns on LinkedIn and I think they did I this is where I'm I kind of get lost because someone else was handling like all these platforms in terms of the distribution they were doing I believe display network as well just to that targeted account list very small and then we'd have the SDR team work on every single person on that account list as well at the same exact time so it's both inbound and then outbound motions too. I think they're very relevant content. And then this is where the this is where the data team got in and they were looking at okay like we need like we need to know exactly like what kinds of uh what kinds of websites or claims or like creative like ads here on the display network people in this account that are VPs are clicking. So we know that we need to push those harder or switch it. And the same thing for like the product leads that we were targeting etc. very complic like very complicated. I'm not giving it justice like this operation justice because it was not me who built this thing. I was just within it. Um that's the best example that I can genuinely give on like professional services huge contract values with uh paid media but like again I was running a little bit less like not as big investment banking private credit PE. Um, I'm assuming they're trying to target these people. Like, you can absolutely run Facebook ads, like a just a straight up good ad, and get leads like this. Like, if your pixel is good enough and if you know that the market is on there, you can absolutely run Facebook ads to get those people to opt in or do whatever you want them to do. Um, you just have to understand that your cost is probably going to be absolutely insane and that is totally okay. Don't try to like be like, oh, like I need my CPMs now to be like, come on, you're targeting [ __ ] PE firms. Like if your economics on the back end supporting it and you know that then just keep running it. You know it's going to be expensive. So just be realistic with the expectations, you absolutely run Facebook ads to get those people 100%. Yeah. Yeah. I had conversations uh early on in my version of this uh that was basically around helping private equity firm get deal flow for a specific niche. So like call it dentist or whatever and trying to find them because they do link they do every outbound thing you can imagine. They have the whole, you know, corner office that's all they do is dial and then they get paid as percents. You know, when things hit LOI, they get this and they maybe get some deal close amount. And then they also have external like referral partners that'll get one or two or whatever. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it was five. I have no idea. But the uh transaction amount um they would get a portion of it as like referral. And I was like, that's a big think again monetization model like that makes sense. Like it's just how much cash flow do you have? And I ended up talking to a guy and he was like, "Yeah, the real game is to almost like have that entire sales floor." So basically get them to LOI. So which is way different, right? I mean, you're talking like 92 different things on that. And I don't know that world well enough, but like if you can get them to that stage and then deliver them, it's like the amount that you get is so much higher or you are the one actually doing the rollup yourself and then you just package it and sell it off to a private equity company with a bow on it. And it's like, you know, there's a lot of ways to take this skill set and use it across different industries, but we are eight over and we got one more and I need it. I need it. So, we have to finish the sheet. I can't not finish the sheet. How far over? Selling to women versus selling to men. You all know the good stuff. They look different. They have different trade-offs. They have different interests. They have different money, but time, all that stuff. So, we'll just general stroke of what what is the difference? GC. This is sad because this is the one thing that I really wanted to talk about cuz I know you sell to women and I had this entire thing from nothing held because this has helped me. No. Okay. Okay. Um, if you want to know how to sell to women really well, go to Nothing Held Back the Facebook group. It's free. It's open to anyone watching this. And there's a girl in there. I think her name is Lauren. I believe her name is Lauren. She talks about this stuff all day every day because she exclusively sells to women. I have not sold to women enough to give you like everyone like the best answer. I'll give you as much as I know from the data that I have. But if you really want to learn how to do it, go to open up Facebook. Nothing held back. You can probably just search selling to women and you'll see the post. But first, I'll preface it there. What I've seen with selling to women is the if you use the kind of bro marketing that a lot of this like let's say you're in info, right? Let's just use yours as an example. Um and I'm sure your CMO like he he's been known he's known this for like the past five years. If you use the same like kind of like bro marketing and bro messaging and vibe with and when I say vibe I'll go into that a bit later like with women you will put them off. And so what I've seen with women is if you try to have an ounce of remember what we like what we talked about with like the negative self- admittance. If you do that even a little bit, you can get away with it a little bit with men. Do it with women, you're cooked. Absolutely cooked. Women look for validation inherently more than men. We all look for validation. But more than men and my experience, they look for validation that they are okay. They are okay as they are now. which is really difficult when you're trying to do change work, right? It's very difficult to try to get them from like agitating pain, right? But also making sure that they know that they're okay. Difficult, right? And so what Lauren talk about, this is from post from her is instead of being like you have a problem, you say you could be better. you're already great as you are, but you could be even better, right? That is often used like that, at least according to people who've sold to way more women than I have, that's kind of like how you want to do it. Another thing that I've seen is like tonality and pacing matters a lot. Like a lot. You cannot be demeaning in your language or overtly aggressive. I've seen like if you have an ad and because like usually when you're selling to women you have like a female spokesperson like toning it down a little bit more and kind of having that more like friendly onetoone approach is like le on their same level not acting like you're talking to like at them but like you're talking with them I've seen works like really well. Um, and I'm saying that I don't know a lot about this because I was I was a copywriter for a female dating offer, teaching women how to get dates with highv value men. Um, and I was writing some copy, but we had a copy chief. And so he would like chief all this stuff and like he would kind of give me like these little pointers, but he would end up like doing like these massive reservations like when I first started in this like he would do all that stuff. That's like really the last time I sold to women. But he implanted this in me. It was like when when they tested like again that tonality really mattered and the the big thing was like do not tell them that they have a problem with themselves. Make them know that they're okay as they are. They could get better but that's like kind of where you want to end it. But I feel like you would have way more insight into this because you're actively doing it right now. So I want to hear your thoughts on this. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to be the first to say like I'm not in it enough to like I can give you some overarching but like these guys like you said CMO like they are pros at it. We have our copyriter that's written two emails a day every day plus every automation and script as brand face right like they are the ones who are in it. Um, we have had comments in uh nothing held back great group and I would definitely go there because there's a bunch in there but I think it was I think it actually was Lauren but she commented that she was a past customer of ours client and and then she loved it and all this stuff and that uh but FYI like you do have a bit of like bro marketing style stuff like we gave no and right and like yeah there's like there are males in the acquisition side of the company and then majority is female for sure but there's definitely some you know males over acquisition just how the cookie crumbles with this industry thus far. Um, and very happy to be in the other. Another good thing I learned um or perspective I had when in the group was someone was saying the difference in masculine versus feminine energy more so than you know gender and this isn't like a gender conversation but like the the thinking behind that. Um because you have women that maybe like for our stuff strong is new sexy like leans into like the kind of already harder and heavier approach not as soft and generic. So for ours, we kind of can dance that line in my opinion a little bit more where it shifts that um the high performance energy like we we lean in that which generally is back and forth. It's like of course there's a feminine energy and there's that whole thing and that's like the key pillar but there's like sprinkles of this. Um when it comes to actual like framing it's crazy like Alen talks about it like instead of having free bonuses you have free gifts. uh instead of having this there's like subtle stuff that they layer through there that's like you know discounts if your favorite thing that's $150 shirt is off 20% like that's a steal and like all this stuff like they they talked about that on a meeting literally last week about how how to frame and then the other piece is the for us right is the phone call and is how you navigate that and the framing before the phone call you can set in the application bring them through these states like uh Allen has a has a post in there that he talks about bringing them from X state to Y state throughout the journey so that by the time they're like kind of in pain still and like you said it's like you got to navigate that to where it's like yes they may understand they can't do it on their own but they don't need to feel like bad about like themselves and that's a thread the needle situation um and then on the actual phone call someone was posting about this Josh Gavin was talking about this about the difference in selling over the phone to men versus women and the different personas and again I'm going to use feminine energy and masculine energy when I say this but like the decision maker is often different in uh like the the overarching societal expectation or norm is like you know the the female wears the pants or whatever like that and that that persona owns it. So we don't have the same similarities of someone who sells MMO over the phone and the guy's like I got to talk to my wife before I drop 20 grand on this versus you have the female that like if it's the right frame and it's the right good thing and you're actually selling you know you're not bullying and you're not whatever but like there's a very clean way to make it so it's like that person generally makes the decision. That's again societal norm and you can kind of get them to that line and like we're super liberal with like refunds and stuff and if there's ever like something that would happen post purchase where there was a disagreement around that and it became a thing like you're good out of the program here's your money back like no no no worries but just knowing that dynamic and understanding the societal norms or what you think or based on your discovery process over the phone kind of feeling out where that sits um because that's also not true sometimes where it's very overarching uh with a spouse or with someone in life where they're like, you know, they need to be kind of like pulled through that and they might need the double check. But yeah, all the messaging we try and we took that feedback around the bro marketing thing I sent to the copyriter and he changed some stuff up. The CMO that came in and his like acquisition senior copyrighter whatever he brought in like they're very privy to this and have worked in this market. So, I'm sure they're great. I mean, they they and they also are like I don't know. My whole thing is like how you are as a person also like comes through and those guys are like you know uh girl dads and they are you know a wife and a daughter and they every you know marketing meeting are sharing client win channel stuff and are like the most hype in all the channels. So like they also like feel it and are it so I think it then comes through when it comes to copy. Um but you definitely got to double check. So yeah, that's that's actually a really important part that I didn't get to touch on yet. It's simple, so I won't drone on too much, but writing speaking like exactly like your avatar, like exactly like them. Um, so damn important. The same way like on a sales call because I had like train sales teams like I I've done sales like I'm good at it. I just hate doing it. Mirroring, right? It's like when the second that you mirror like all of a sudden like you're like people actually open up, right? Right? They actually let you talk. They're actually there. They're more engaged. You can literally hear that flip from when they're like resistance to now acceptance is when you mirror pacing, tonality. You get on the phone with someone, they're low energy, now you become low energy. Match them, right? Instead of there being that kind of that bump. And so it's very similar. It's the same exact thing in your copy and your ads. Like when we had a bunch of UGC creators creating content for us, I literally trained them on this. So I was like the same way that I trained my sales skill. like here's the prospect, here's the product, here's like everything in the surrounding, like here's the emotional states, like if it was like negative emotional state, positive emotional state, like XYZ, all that stuff. Like I would train the UGC creator on that because what people neglect all the time and I had a post about this is like pay attention to how Tony Robbins records his ads, the way he says the stuff like he's at this point he's gotten to such a level where he so inherently understands pacing and tonality that he can get on there and get you from hyped up to emotional to where he can play with your emotions so easily. Right? And for me I want to be able to do the same thing. But first, I have to match. And so I tell my UGC creators, hey, this market is in a low emotional state. Like I'll give my if if there's people here who like sell debt settlement right now. Like I'm going to give you some sauce. Like the entire market is in low emotional state. So look up my because I know we're already over time. Look up my tweet about emotional states. Look up Allen's Allen's Facebook post on Nothing Held Back about low emotional states as well. Um and it tells you like how you need to give them a reason why they're in this thing. Um not how to solve it because they're low emotional state. They want a reason why they're in the thing. So, you introduce that first. What I love to do is shift blame. Blame someone besides themselves because low emotional state people, they will not take blame on themselves. Like that just gets them into even a lower emotional state. Shift blame to something else. Usually the system and you'll see these kinds of ads everywhere once you actually understand the structure of how this copy actually works. You'll see this everywhere now. Shift the blame to something else, right? some other thing, the system, the man, Uncle Sam, whatever, whoever you want it to be that's re relevant to your avatar, right? And then now you introduce yourself as the hero, right? As the hero who's fighting back or this system, if you want to be even more nuanced, as this the mechanism is the thing that's fighting back, not necessarily your company or your offer, but like the mechanism is the thing that's fighting back. So if anyone's doing debt settlement, that's how you like think about that and like make some math and then come back to me. Um, and so that tonality matching is so important. And that's like the one thing that I would say like that's a very easy thing to optimize for. Like you can literally keep the same script, the same everything. If you just change the way that the ad is presented and how if you have a UGC grader or you yourself is saying it like if you just can modulate and I would like remember the Wolf you know the Wolf of Wall Street um clip where he's like um by the time you read about it in the New York papers it's already too late like that I swear like do that stuff and like just watch what happens seriously watch what happens and that's something that I'm very diligent about now when I have creators or me myself or someone else recording like a talking head ad. Very diligent about it. Very diligent about it. So yeah, this was gas. This is 3 hours of pure sauce. That is unbelievable. I have to sprint out of here. But this was You're going to have to do round two and three and four, I'm sure, and just keep this rolling because I Where did Where do people find you? Because they're going to want more of this sauce. Where do they find you? Uh literally just Twitter. That's the only place that I am. Uh buyer of Media is my username on Twitter. Um, yeah, find me there. I'm gonna be sharing more sauce. I'm gonna make a group for people to come together, share ideas, share sauce, share off. So, it's gonna be nice. Completely free, too. I love it. All right. Anyone who's still here, you got to comment. We're just going to say 3.5. Just just there and that'll count. All right, man. Well, this was fantastic. I will have this uploaded tonight when I get back from this event I'm supposed to be at 20 minutes ago, and we will call it a day. All right. Good, dude. This is fantastic. This pure pure value. I love it. Thank you so much for having me. I'm honored for real. Yeah, dude. 100%. 100%. All right, you guys know where to find him. Talk to you tomorrow. Today is day 84, maybe. We'll see.

# ClickFunnels Asked How We Made $75M w/ One Funnel | EP83
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FAgU9C-xrY

all right everybody Welcome back to another 
episode of ClickFunnels Radio I'm insanely excited   to introduce um a new friend of mine and somebody 
that I've seen a lot of their content on Twitter   on YouTube and they have been doing some amazing 
stuff It's called X now It's called X Oh yeah Yeah   Right So here we have Chris Cameron co-host and 
uh I guess the Jester now jester's privilege kind   of chiming in Granted no kidding Um but uh someone 
that's got uh incredible content greater backstory   a wealth of knowledge So without further ado let's 
go ahead and bring Ryan Clog on ClickFunnels Radio   Ryan thanks for coming on man Absolutely Yeah So 
go ahead Chris I I was going to say I kind of want   to start Here's the deal Okay You've got Warrior 
Babe but I want to I want to clear this up Yeah   You might be a warrior but you're clearly not a 
babe and you've never been through and probably   will never go through menopause However and you're 
definitely not a woman over 40 So why warrior babe   and what How did that happen And like how are 
you focusing on this Ryan Yeah So I am co-owner   not co-founder right So let's let's clear that up 
before any of this But I was essentially number   four or six somewhere in that range We can just 
meet in the middle and call five Uh on the team   and it was started by two co-founders One that's 
kind of more internet marketing e for a lack of   a better phrase Uh and then the other which is 
the co-founder brand face and she is the one who   has all the results had all the experience all of 
that So it's really a you know you call it expert   expert operator a lot of people call it now or 
like that offer publisher style thing Um built the   business with her and around her right uh across 
this whole thing So we're very paid driven and   really built her brand through this uh around 
this but she had insane results before Started   super you know light in terms of like getting 
inerson clients through paid advertising and   then moved into online uh full remote and then we 
have a whole transition we can go into or not but   uh the offers and the product stack had changed 
over time from everything from low ticket in   the very beginning to kind of your uh like hybrid 
info product to now full-on coaching So the actual   deliverable and to answer directly the deliverable 
is through coaches now that have mass amounts of   experience um in the space specifically for women 
for 40 to 60 year old women for that specific you   know use case and result This this is awesome 
man So many people do this do this attractive   character thing where one person does and a lot 
of times their uh their superpower may not be the   operations side right Um but they can be the face 
and they go out and do all this stuff and a lot   of times when you find somebody it's like a Batman 
Robin thing or something You have this face of the   company and then you have an operator So would 
you say you're kind of more on that integrator   operator side and kind of doing all that stuff 
Yeah 100% Leaned into that more so in the last six   months to a year uh in my specifics So basically 
the stack was like sales marketing product face   right it was kind of the initial right because in 
the beginning it's just sales and marketing right   there's not really oper there's nothing to operate 
um so it started a lot like that um and I cannot   give enough credit to them for both founding 
it like that zero to one it's not my skill set   I've never done it I've only done the one to end 
um and they have they crushed it with that and   then the co-founder brand face like she is the 
lifeblood the client wins channel is firing off   uh the methodology she's created the framing 
the brand all around that um that she's evolved   through through I think six or seven years now 
it's been um is just like unbelievable So as we   began to scale from cuz essentially I want to get 
into the offer stack because it's kind of changed   how then the roles moved but we did start with a 
lower ticket model Uh lady boss through you guys   right was like a big poster child at the time 
when we were doing this and we were you know   funnel right we were funnel hacking uh version 
of the uh of that right we were like kind of how   they did their offer stack but our piece was all 
more so around not general fat loss It was the get   toned It was the strong as the new sexy it was 
like this like you know more aggressive style   um which fit the the the personal right brand of 
that and yeah so we started as the low ticket and   then as we transitioned we moved into a call 
funnel with an info product that was $500 mind   you uh over the phone $500 which nobody tried 
that at it doesn't work now with the economics   um and then scaled that up to $1,1500 for 
lifetime access to this info product and   then basically we're stuck at a million a month 
and then we transitioned we left everything the   same on the marketing front and then moved it to 
uh just a different offer of coaching on the back   instead onetoone coaching and that was the jump 
to 3 million a month So same funnel stack same   acquisition just pitching something different 
which obviously changes some of the metrics   but the back end then backed out to there So I 
say that because as we scaled into these other   pockets us three kind of broke out into like our 
sweet spots and our skill sets So the uh initial   like internet marketing style co-founder um Luke 
he moved into sales marketing CEO like that's his   really strong suit He was spending for us up 
to 20K plus a day So like we didn't even need   to bring people into that marketing suite And 
then he and I were leading some version of sales   At one point she did but she led into brand face 
marketing assets fulfillment product like all of   that She's like the superstar of that And that's 
the client results side And then I leaned into all   the tech built all the tech systems ops like as 
that went And then more so way more ops than the   tech and systems and like infrastructure Dang dude 
Let's take one step back because that's insanely   impressive How did you get involved um not only 
with with your current company but let's just   start with the internet Why that Why operations Uh 
give us a sense to your you know business interest   Yeah Um went to ASU in my dorm for a year in class 
for a semester and uh kind of instantly knew that   wasn't going to be the the play and uh tried to 
do some like finance private equity stuff I didn't   really know what that was up until then Long story 
but over a year deal almost is right there falls   through bad partnership all this kind of stuff And 
I was like what is next And that was when I bought   my first internet marketing thing for $497 through 
a webinar funnel um that I now know but didn't at   the time And it was all about um will not mention 
uh but it was all about Instagram shoutouts   essentially So his Instagram shoutouts because 
I think he's off I think he's off the radar now   and I don't want to dox him but uh it's what was 
all about Instagram shoutouts You're basically   creating a graphic contacting all these Instagram 
pages putting it on there and doing a link in bio   you're sending them to an opt-in page and then the 
goal was that you actually set the thank you page   as a redirect to a ClickBank offer to liquidate So 
right so you're paying 300 bucks over here you're   getting whatever 500 leads a thousand leads and 
then those are directly getting redirected after   to a niche you know let's call it women's fitness 
because we're there And then they watch some   ClickBank thing and you make two 300 bucks a day 
and it liquidates and then you're just supposed   to mail the list and monetize And real quick I 
learned after getting 20,000 email subscribers   in like two weeks doing this and breaking even 
that I literally couldn't afford the email hosting   bill for AWeber And I didn't know how I didn't 
want to you know fake email from somebody Like   the whole model was just relying on me doing the 
this part and I just couldn't do it and didn't   have the wherewithal to understand I could pay 
someone to email the list and take a percent and   like do all that So that was the initial chops 
which then led me into Clickfunnels which then   led me into ecom stuff like doing all the things 
I was doing everything you can imagine on like   make money online vibe of courses and education 
and lead genen and affiliate and this stuff and   I'd get everything up to a couple grand a day 
and an ad account would go down or I'd explode   over here or my interest would go over here like 
any of them would have worked All the courses were   good I was me who was not leaning into that and 
I will say that till the day I die is like all   these courses if someone can do it or someone has 
done it you can do it like 100% and I just didn't   So I was fumbling around um a ton and then uh 
ended up buying a consulting.com So Sam Evans   course the middle tier and then again without 
having the wherewithal to see beyond right here   uh realized I didn't want to be the expert 
consultant What did I know Who was I to do   that And it's just not really my scene to be like 
you know until recent like literally you know two   months ago to like share anything or be public Um 
I really quick realized that I just wasn't going   to do what was in the course And so I was just in 
the community I learned all the stuff and it was   all about doing exactly the business model we now 
run And I met somebody in the group that posted   in the community And that ended up being Luke Got 
on a call with him Started doing some sales page   random builds making a thousand bucks every six 
weeks And you know next thing you know five years   later we're here So at what point did they want 
to bring you on full-time Like these funnels these   pages you're building are crushing Um hopefully 
you're building ClickFunnels If not get your free   trial clickfunnels.com Everyone listening Just 
kidding But uh what was that process like Yeah it   was uh at that time it was long form two-step uh 
on page So I was like learning I knew a little bit   of stuff around uh CF Pro Tools was kind of newer 
but we were using some functions out of that and   like shout out Jamie Yeah Yeah Right And making it 
so you know we could capture optin information on   a on a three-step Basically we're trying to funnel 
hack everybody who does it Um so I was building   those and at the time it was more so you know we 
were just so shortsighted There was no ascension   to it which is the whole point of doing it right 
something like that low ticket we had an Otto that   was lifetime access that kind of that like it 
did liquidate it was making some money but we   didn't know our numbers on retention and churn 
and LTV you know in comparison to C like we just   didn't know any of that so yeah I was basically 
building those and Luke called me one day and was   like yeah like how do we take this thing to 10 
million and I was like let's just do a callunnel   like it was right when co had started and we were 
like let's just let's just do a call funnel and   we had this course that they had already made and 
had sold whatever a hundred units of maybe that   was this basically ovens model thing So it's your 
large Kajjabi portal your group coaching and your   community and it was like not really fleshed out 
but like it had all of the pieces and parts and   all the course content already built like let's 
just sell it over the phone so we can control the   economics So that was when so at that point Luke 
was like all right cool like ownership let's do   this let's break it out and that's evolved over 
time So you talk about this book a call thing   Um and then you also said that it doesn't work 
anymore because the economics So this was a $500   thing Is that the one that you're referring to 
Yeah Yeah Because I mean think about it If you   have a $200 cost per call which is like Totally 
Yeah Right It's you that's not that's before   showed call 50% of your calls are going to show 
rough numbers So now you have a $400 live call   Do the math on how you're going to make more than 
500 And that's before overhead That's before right   That or sales commissions Your sales commission 
alone plus that is your you're losing money Do   you guys still run that model at all just at a 
higher price point Yes we did 72 million directly   through a call funnel Same way Okay so I want 
to know I want to know like the steps of that   call funnel I'd love to hear like pricing Are you 
sending them to like a VSSL Are you sending them   to like a webinar first that's booked a call What 
is the process Yeah So we've never done webinars   We've never done pre-recorded in that way where 
it's like you know a git whatever or JIT like   we've never done any of those directly Um we 
did actually that's not true We tried it way   back before we started the call funnel and just 
turned it off Um but no the funnel ended up so   at that time we had bought the consulting.com 
program I had bought Becker's program that he   had at the time which was iron mastermind and we 
bought salesprocess.io So I bought like $15,000   worth of courses locked myself in an Airbnb and we 
built it like over a weekend And it is opt-in page   uh which is your class Dude Ryan you are the 
epitome by the way of marketing nerd When I see   you light up it's like let's talk numbers let's 
talk conversion This is everyone be taking notes   Yeah Yeah Yeah No And again the important part of 
what you said at the beginning is like you know   the 46-y old women and the client wins and like it 
fuels this whole machine Yeah But I'm I'm a huge   fan of taking the internet marketing principles 
and applying them to something that's not towards   other marketers Um I think there's a place for it 
for sure and there's you know 50 people in a room   and they all want people to teach coaches how to 
coach people on coaching No you know you know I   don't and there guess what There are people who 
crush it at this and like the top top kingpin   people And I also think there is a lane for it for 
the guy who's the best at webinars and the best at   SMS and the best at this selling to each other 
But when it gets a little more broad stroke at   just like how to be the best at like acquisition 
and then like then they're all selling that But   that's separate point But yeah so the funnel 
itself is opt-in page It's your very it's your   classic It is your headline image right We've 
tested a few variations We basically stuck on   the same with the popup name email We do not do 
phone number Uh we do not do phone number because   at the time and still to this day we don't have 
the capacity to use the phone numbers well enough   to justify the decrease Right Because you're going 
to get 30% less optins with a phone number You can   wiggle that and optional and whatever but just 
call it that Hey I'm looking at this right now   and I notice you've got the quick video and it's 
vertical Usually you know you'd have like a sales   page like this and it's going to be you know 
the landscape Is there a reason that you used   vertical here Is that to match up with just like 
and everything else Yeah So it depends which one   you're on but yeah So there's a large swath of 
what you're looking at So the at the time it was   a VSSL opt-in funnel up until two three months ago 
and all 72 million were through that And it was an   opt-in page name email go to a VSSL Over X amount 
of time we rolled out what you're talking about   which is a vertical versus a horizontal Vertical 
is only supposed to play on mobile but depending   on what you're looking at some haven't been edited 
for the newer stuff you're looking at Uh they're   going to watch that and there's going no CTA is 
huge So no CTA on that at all Force consumption   Uh you're going to have a massive amount of drop 
off and that's okay because you get their email   right So we remarket heavy Um they will then be 
able to apply They fill out an application We've   on you know on variation 16 of the application Um 
and then they go from the app to uh book a call   They book a call and they talk to a sales rep and 
they talk to a sales rep and you know one slash   two if it's a follow-up call close And that's Okay 
Before we go further before we go further though   you said version 16 All right Yes So this is all 
data driven You What are some of the key things   that made you say "Okay we're going on to the next 
version." And then how did you kind of know which   was performing better and say "All right now 
we're going to do this version." Yeah So we tie   everything So the difficulty with something 
like this versus you know just looking at   your ClickFunnel stats page is on page conversion 
percentage does not map to revenue per XYZ action   Thank you Yes Yeah Correct So you need backend no 
matter what So I don't know how we don't do it in   ClickFunnels at this scale because where we're 
at So we use HubSpot for our CRM but you need   somewhere that stores all of that data because for 
example let's use something extreme just because   it's easier to think of two opt-in pages and one 
promises a free cruise and one promises a you know   get toned and it's going to be the hardest thing 
of your entire existence One's going to get a 2%   opt-in rate and one's going to get you know an 
80% opt-in rate Doesn't mean they're spending   money Yeah But the one that on the back end that's 
actually going to convert into your product that   has congruency that is coming in with the right 
framing is going to be a higher revenue per lead   or per whatever action matter call then you 
then yes So there's a lot of different numbers   It's the rev it's cash collected It's net It's 
Yeah So it's not as simple as saying this video   outperformed There's a lot of other pieces that 
No It could have one could have a 50% engagement   rate One could have a 20% engagement rate But if 
the 20% one says oh this is expensive and you're   going to have to work for this and it's going to 
be like it's application only and the other one   says "Oh it's a free breezy ride and just apply 
Everyone gets into it and it's $12." One's going   to have a higher click-through higher app higher 
booking but they're not going to convert Yeah This   is kind of the This is kind of like popcorn at 
the movie theater idea I don't know It's not a   direct correlation but like which would actually 
sell more Like revenue-wise Yeah We're going to   sell a lot lot more popcorn at five bucks than 10 
bucks but what's the actual revenue at the end of   the day Yeah And when you only have one offer uh 
in in that example uh it's much more difficult   right because like you can't you can't even swing 
it by volume right It's it's literally just do   they close It's a unit game And then obviously 
cash per unit but we have those numbers Those are   different Let's let's get nerdy Let's get nerdy 
Too late We already did bro Yeah Yeah that's also   true We're going to continue to get nerdy Um one 
of my favorite sayings especially in this game is   just the path is math right There's so much that 
it's actually not too difficult to make the right   data driven decision when your foundation is set 
in the proper way I really feel like everything   you've done professionally has accomplished that 
perfectly What did you do Cuz it kind of seems   like maybe you came into this business and they 
weren't as dialed in as they should have been I'm   not trying to generalize but just based on this 
conversation and you came in and really tightened   the screws You mentioned like CAC to LTV looking 
at you know fullfunnel conversion rates What tell   us that process like what did you do to start to 
figure out those numbers Yeah that this is a full   evolution of all three of us throughout this that 
Luke is light years ahead of me in everything and   you know in all these other in all these ways Uh 
she is light years ahead of me in all these ways   and I have you know my little pocket of skill set 
that has been evolved through doing this Let's be   very clear this was not a I came into it and was 
like "Oh what's your LTV to CAC ratios and what is   this and that?" Like this has been an evolution 
over years and like learnings from doing and   also continuing to buy courses continuing to 
mass consume content like that So yeah I did   not know any of this coming into this I mean I 
literally applied basically to work with Luke to   learn everything about sales marketing funnels and 
whatever and knew my the smidg of it But like you   know I learned pretty quick and learned that and 
then we're all in newfound Like we we joke that   everyone at the company up until recent every 
time we do a record month it's everyone's PR   Like there's not someone coming in with experience 
that's like "Oh let me apply this system and model   of somewhere else." Which has been a shortcoming 
right over time because you know we maybe hit   these levels and it's like we don't know how to 
go past it Yeah It's real sales We don't know how   like you know and you try and model it off someone 
from YouTube or some course or something and you   get you know up to that level maybe or kind of 
spin it your own way or apply it yourself Um and   only as of recent so like when we did went from 
one to three we brought in a sales manager that   had done three before in his pod He was a top pod 
leader at another info coaching company that was   at like 12 million a month I think at the time 
or not Actually that's not true They're at sub   10 Now they're at like 12 to 15 But uh he had run 
their pod their highest performing pod came in we   switched the offers we added you know finally we 
added all this stuff and he put in you know the   energy and the time and the development and all 
this stuff to the people and we went from one to   three right over over that year And that was last 
year going from last year we did whatever 11 or 12   or two ago and then last year 2024 we did 30 and 
that jumped So we 3xed year-over-year Big jump   Everything broke right So it's like everything 
that could break broke and uh yeah So all to say   that like we learned this stuff during it and 
now yeah this is much more my pocket and I have   learned the numbers back and forth and everything 
down to margin if you're selling an info versus   coaching versus what and the sales reps making 
comms on 30-day versus full contract value and   cash collection like blah blah blah But like yeah 
I didn't know any of this So I learned all of this   by doing it in it and every month is my PR too So 
definitely some shortsightedness and comingings   of that Um but now our new cso has gone you know 
done over hundred uh a year in phone sales which   is fantastic So our 8 to 10 million a month 
he's done before Um our outbound director has   done three and a half million I believe in setter 
before Our CMO has sold over 100,000 load tickets   through one funnel So like we're stacking the 
team now and it's on you know seuite or whatever   you want to call it And yeah they've already done 
PRs outside of us and now it's like hey let's just   implement what we've done Yeah that's a tough one 
because a lot of times you're looking at you know   you're learning and you kind of cap out and go to 
try to find somebody who's done more is difficult   right to bring them in and like you know if 
you're going to have a software that you want   to do 500 million a year in probably good to have 
an operator that's done that somewhere before Yeah   that's a great example of like the software side 
or like the tech side It's like we don't know Like   we joke that sometimes it is like enough duct tape 
wrapped around it like it's not going to break But   is that the most efficient way to balance to 
balance a jet on the other end of it and it's   like no it's not So like we just hired a company 
to come in and we're restructuring all of our data   from like a toz source of truth everything that's 
done it for hundred million dollar you know info   coaching That's not cheap It's not terrible but 
it's not cheap Yeah Yeah Yeah Not terrible but   not cheap Yeah I got you in an add moment I almost 
want to go back to this funnel though because I   think I cut you off I was talking about Yeah Okay 
So you do this Yeah You do this apply thing right   And then they go to a call You just mentioned 
setters and closers too How does this go How do   you figure that out after they're kind of clicking 
apply now Yeah So for 71 or two million up until   eight weeks ago we had no setters whatsoever So 
we did went straight to a closer like an hourong   call or what 30 minute phone slot However many 
hundreds of calls a day let's just say every day   for years Uh for you got some sales warriors Yeah 
No it's a for us it was always a volume game It   was much more around there to make the math work 
than it was around the crazy kind of like internet   marketing sales stuff you hear of where it's all 
that and all to say that's not necessarily the   correct way to do it uh or the best way to do it 
because we could have squeezed more We could have   maybe you know done this stuff So we're in lie of 
changes right now on how we maybe expand those Um   about two years ago we moved everyone to Zoom So 
it was phone calls before that Um and then yeah   the office stack has changed throughout So now 
everyone's on Zoom uh oneto ones But then what's   what's the benefit there Just that they're seeing 
they're seeing the people talking or the fact   that it's in like a calendar invite that reminds 
them why Zoom more effective Yeah both But I mean   our demo right 4060 it there is a bit of a tech 
issue sometimes with the Zoom So like phone's a   good backup Um but yeah you can just control the 
narrative a lot better It's like you know you and   I looking at looking at each other here There's 
also cons right It's like if you have a messy   background if you show up disheveled if there's 
whatever uh if you aren't confident in your thing   it's hard to pitch and and if you're not confident 
But there's a lot of pro it's a magnifying glass   simply put right So it's like Yeah And then now we 
have a deck So now we actually have like a like a   like a pitch thing we walk through um that kind 
of highlights some important key aspects We can   show before and after We can you know we can show 
the different stuff on call Uh that makes it a lot   better as well But that that's two weeks old Okay 
cool So on this call you know you have people who   are good salespeople some people who are learning 
but with the deck I think now you're having just   people follow a script that makes more sense but 
is there is there a discovery Like what is what   is this script of this call Give us kind of an 
idea of what that 30 minutes breaks down Yeah I   mean I'm I'm gently getting out of my realm here 
so I wanted that to be known This isn't 100% my   speed but they just rolled out a new script and 
of course yes discovery Um but initially a big   thing right with the time aotment is setting the 
frame setting the tone we don't have time to go   and bounce around and go and narrate hopefully the 
application gets that background Yeah application   gets a lot of background that then you can 
prod into and you know why why can't you   do this on your own or why haven't you been able 
to and you know the classic bridge the gap right   u for sure and the beauty of what we do too and 
what we're selling is the personalization aspect   so it's not we're not pitching you know you're 
pitching yes one thing but within that thing   has personalization beyond belief So there are 
different people that come in different phases   of like you said menopause There's different 
age brackets There's different current body   types There's different desired body types You 
blend those all together and there's you know   27 tracks you could go on uh when you multiply 
that out So it's like but all of them can tailor   to that through this offering uh which works out 
really well So yeah it's essentially doing that   um through the deck and then also highlighting uh 
you know client wins our process how we look at   this all of that quick video application funnel go 
to a call what's the price point And and obviously   if you have a number of different things that 
that your sales rep can now say okay this fits   you best Are they all at different price points 
Kind of choose your own adventure or what Nope   All the same So right now it's around seven grand 
um for like a PIFF Um but there's payment plans   internal We have external as well that we do use 
kind of Um but yeah it's around that price Then   we have the internal pay plans you know equal out 
to more because you have the cash collection risk   But yeah we've danced around I mean it's gone 
from five it's gone to six it's gone to seven   Uh you know we have people in our space Um I don't 
really like you know competitors We're all doing   the same thing We're all helping the same audience 
Sometimes there's a little bit of overlap but like   there's ones that are 10 and 30k in our space 
Um and and higher I know that So yeah it just   depends on the offering Um so where we're at with 
ours is that you went from five to six to seven   Is that because you're like "Wait shoot We're 
selling a ton of these at five Let's try six."   And then you pay attention to the data Yeah where 
the market went and then also like I mass consume   hormone information and understanding where a 
coach will sit on roster and how much they can   make and have it very competitive for them and all 
that and then having that as a function of margin   So it's like if they're going to make whatever 20% 
of the thing it's like we need to divide that out   and see where we can land that fits market you 
know you're Dan you're you're rocking hard place   a little bit But I hope people are understanding 
like what they're hearing though Ben Like a simple   video application phonefunnel 70 plus million 
I mean no setters volume like yes it's it's in   this in that example it's very much so like an 
acquisition company right It's it's not direct I   mean it's like direct response kind of but like it 
has those principles but it is a little bit more   evergreen Another thing we didn't super go into 
So we have a large organic engine that exists that   only services middle and bottom of funnel So and 
not necessarily by design Let me make that also   clear like it is it would be amazing if we had 
first click that was coming from there and we had   organic flow and you talked to all these [ __ ] 
guys and you know a lot of the Clickfunnels guys   too that you know can make a couple hundred grand 
a month just strictly from their organic audience   Um that has not been the case historically for us 
It is extremely uh paid mediadriven Um you know   90 whatever percent of it is firstclick paid and 
then once they're in the ecosystem once you drop   them in there and x amount percent uh x percentage 
of them apply they go into the email flows We send   10 emails a day We point them back to the website 
and there's a content web for days You could watch   content around every specific piece and there's 
podcasts and there's videos and there's long form   blog There's like everything Um so that's been 
a really big thing for us Uh because when you're   running that kind of volume and what you're doing 
you know you're saying callunnel the big thing   around call funnels in my opinion and we can 
go to the other funnels we're running now too   because I think that'll be helpful Um it's all 
about consumption because you're going from ice   cold lead to you know within 48 hours getting 
pitched 7K 10K 15K And that's why the organic   ones have such good numbers because they have that 
trust and they have that consumption prior So when   you're going through paid it's it's a different 
ballgame I hate this saying Ryan but it's true   because the fortune is in the followup probably 
because it's just too cliche at this point But   when you say content centered around middle of 
funnel and bottle bottom of funnel basically how   I describe this to beginners sometimes is right 
when you're top of funnel it's problem product or   sorry problem solution product right Would you say 
your content strategy drives around that a little   bit as well So a lot of YouTube content podcast 
etc isn't really around the problem but more   solution based because it's built for middle and 
bottom of funnel Yes Solution solution and also   like keyword right So think uh think the very 
top of funnel being like lose weight right And   then think middle of funnel using specifics around 
you know strength training using specifics around   micro macronutrients like stuff like that that's 
kind of more in-depth or more like unless you know   you don't know right type of stuff Um so there 
is a pocket that has existed that is a little bit   more general and we're starting up the content 
engine this week of like let's do some correct   packaging and let's try and do some kind of mass 
amounts of potential organic first click uh which   would be amazing for us But yeah a majority of 
it has existed in there and then also there's a   ton of content that's around customer reviews and 
customer long form testimonials because we look at   it like essentially the the tranches of reviews 
are you're going to get your Facebook messages   inside your group You're going to get your 
comments You're going to get your uh chats with   coaches whatever is textbased That's like the most 
volume you're going to get The next is going to be   your pictures like your before and afters your 
progress photos stuff like that which is going   to be lesser but more impactful The next layer is 
going to get them all doing a standardized like   selfie video review that can be used And then the 
bottom and the least but the most impactful in my   opinion is the long form customer interviews So 
we have a ton of content that exists like that   on site and on YouTube that is long form 30 to 
50 minutes of uh you know Nikki brand face and   company lead doing customer interviews with one 
two three-year customers of the product which   acted really really good as middle and bottom 
funnel but would never be something that is a cold   top offunnel thing They're not going to Yeah Yeah 
Right All right So last thing around at least that   I have around follow-up You've mentioned a piece 
of this organic content is email as well right   This is lead capturing How much of a autoresponder 
are your leads put in to still book a call How   long does that last Yeah maybe they didn't Yeah 
we're sending five to 10 10 million emails a month   at this point Uh so let's So as an individual 
so someone comes in and they opt in but they   don't apply So we the flows are essentially for 
the VSSL funnel is going to be your opt no apply   your apply no book your book no show and then 
your you know closed basically right you're going   to have those simple buckets so they're going 
to get the most contextual follow-up possible   uh golden nugget win is in order to get those 
first opens and those clicks you're going to   fire off that they're getting that training which 
is very common but in our VSSLs a lot of the old   ones we're testing some stuff without this now 
so don't tell me I'm not doing it now when you   funnel hack me um but we will do you know stay 
until the end and get these bonuses and in doing   that we then deliver it via email So that gets 
really good opens and clicks and all that and then   on that you're sending them back to a page that's 
the VSSL testimonial wall Your bonuses are at the   bottom and they scroll all the way to the bottom 
to get the bonuses that are info products that   are calculators that are PDFs that are whatever Um 
so that's that initial flow is your opt So you're   going to get all those contextual someone's going 
to apply but not book call it 50% of those people   There are people out there that embed the widget 
and say they get 100% which obvious um because you   can't com you can't complete the form without the 
booking Um but the app no books are hot for us and   that's where we get phone number for the first 
time So you can do email follow-up you can do   text follow-up you can introduce setters you can 
do whatever and then the next is going to be that   no-show basically no-show reschedule pipeline and 
then closed with that That's your automations Now   your blasts or your campaigns or whatever you 
call them in your software we're sending two a   day every day forever Two a day Two a day Every 
day That's what middlefunnel content primarily   Yeah That's Oh hey check out this video Oh hey do 
this Oh here's a link to a free product Here's an   asset Here's a free resource Chris we got to relay 
that Two emails a day Every day Yeah Two Two a day   I mean obviously you figured out that you're not 
getting a lot of unsubscribes or you'd go down to   one or something So is that what you're tracking 
Why two a day I watched a video way back when and   this is the marketing team right Again I kind of 
sit over here now and like I'm giving opinions   on this or kind of like what we've done but not 
what I'm doing I'm not writing the emails every   day and you know analyzing the data down to the 
nth degree but uh someone's on your email list   because they want to be on your email list right 
They are for a reason And the ones who don't want   to you'd rather them unsubscribe and be off that 
anyway than you would not right So like you want   to give them the value You don't want to hammer 
them with CTAs You don't want to say like apply   apply like you know just hammer them with that But 
if you're leading with value first and it's framed   in a good way that's actually good information and 
stuff they can consume They can learn stuff they   can whatever like no problem with it Um no problem 
with it when you're hammering them with CTA every   day as one of the two emails Like no that doesn't 
work or make sense I mean I'm sure it does work   for some things but you're just aggressively 
cleaning your list and getting rid of the people   that maybe could convert after x amount of touch 
points in my opinion Um yeah there's a lot of ways   to do this and there's a lot of pros on this 
portion of it Um but yeah our copyriter it's   two a day That's crazy nurture too My gosh crazy 
nurture How often are you dropping in CTAs then Uh   well it's all buried in the content too So once 
you content everything on site has sticky here   sticky here like all these different directions So 
I mean it's already all pushes there and then that   apply pushes to the center to the middle of funnel 
of the other funnel of like the core funnel right   So like your apply page brings them back into flow 
in the middle Um which is extremely helpful right   for all your tracking needs Uh because then you 
get all your sources and they all end up going   into one place but you have your path tracking 
So what content works what emails work That's   why we kind of like brief touched on it but it's 
very very important once you start to get to a   certain size and scale that you're storing all 
of this in one place Uh you can use close you   can use HubSpot you can use I'm sure ClickFunnels 
has some variation of it with all the touch points   you know not super privy Uh I'm on 1.0 to make 
it known Um but uh yeah I mean you need somewhere   that you can see when you're doing something 
that's not direct to cardart because if you can't   see that then you don't know what is impactful 
You don't know what touch points existed Uh we   use Hyros for that piece of it for the journey 
We actually don't use Hyros for the pixel side   of things which is funny enough Uh we do that 
custom but we use them for the journey because   it's best out of the box that you can find where 
they went what content pieces what categories of   content all that Gotcha Fascinating I know Um what 
other funnels we diving into I know we mentioned   VSSL funnels You had a couple talked about the 
other ones We have three right now Yeah Yeah So   this is the this is the whole like what you know 
popped off or whatever on YouTube and cuz walking   through these So the three the three offers that 
we went through were a low ticket that was like   essentially like a recurring monthly app that had 
uh Otto that was lifetime access So call it $27   with like a trial and then it was $150 I think at 
the time $147 for lifetime access Idea being that   you more than liquidated and that you made all 
your money on the recurring Okay that was like   initial goal Math wasn't math thing We didn't 
have more ascension rungs We didn't even know   that was a thing at that time Uh it just we just 
weren't privy Next was this info funnel and we   were selling an info product through a VSSL opt-in 
funnel which is the one I just described We got up   to a million a month just doing that strictly 
through volume right We were doing 10 to 12   million bucks a year all day doing that The next 
iteration was that exact same VSSL opt-in funnel   and that's what we did 30 million with last year 
and everything exploded The acquisition exploded   in Q3 into Q4 on the ad side and then how that 
then filled calendars because the other game here   is direct to cart versus uh callfunnel You have 
availability you need to constantly be threading   that needle on how booked the uh calendars are for 
10 sales reps or 50 sales reps Where we broke was   this what you're saying is the other funnels and 
the acquisition We didn't have anything teed up We   likely pushed it too far We went too hard on that 
one funnel and for too long of an amount of time   and we didn't differentiate We brought in a new 
CMO into this new thing We had talked about low   ticket We had talked about these other type of 
funnels and we had never done anything about it   and that is why we got caught holding and it was 
bad uh CPA's rising trying to get marketing guys   in that's not working because it was around the 
actual structure and what we were using for the   funnels as much as it was around the actual media 
buying and the creative okay so the three funnels   we run now VSSL optin funnel that one still runs 
same core one okay still gets a majority of the   piece of that that comes through there we have 
another VSSL opt-in funnel that's the same funnel   structure but has a different VSSL I'm going 
to come back to this because it's going to be   funny the next one we're running is a DTA funnel 
is what we're calling Some call it a direct to   VSSL I don't know what you guys call it over at 
ClickFunnels but it's going to be your classic   headline VSSL apply button So you're skipping the 
optin Okay with that you lose consumption You get   rid of friction We actually have a different app 
on there because we need to qualify them harder   and then it goes straight to booking So your cost 
per call your cost per app whatever is going to be   way lower generally speaking uh because they can 
go right through it There are different ways to   do that where the button on there that applies 
either wait it waits until the CTA it waits x   amount of minutes you can do stuff with your VSSL 
on Vidalytics or whatever the Omni whatever one   is to make it so you get opt-in information we 
don't do any of that right now but that one runs   um and gets a very good cost per call and very 
per uh good cost per app and cost per call but   the issue is the consumption isn't there as 
much You can only hammer them so much between   the time that they apply or book and before they 
get on a phone call So you have lower show rates   and you have lower close rates because of the 
consumption because of the friction There are   ways to nail this There's ways to delay the CTA 
for five minutes and achieve a similar amount of   consumption Never going to be as much as someone 
who opted in and got nine emails and watched this   and then went over here and then applied Uh or was 
forced to wait until 22 minutes through the VSSL   to apply Um but yeah so it's just a different game 
of consumption versus cost It's like this this   economics model of cost versus consumption And 
then the most recent uh and the one that's doing   really well for us is the low ticket ascension So 
we will sell a low ticket product sub50 bucks Um   and the entire goal of that is ascension into the 
back end not AOV and not uh liquidation I mean yes   at some level obviously you want to drive it as 
high as possible to try and aim for liquidation Um   but it is not front-end profitable and the goal is 
not to be So quick math on that Let's say it costs   you $100 to sell something that's $50 Okay so your 
net AOV or I'm sorry your net CPA is $50 right The   spread between those you lost $50 for everyone you 
purchased So for us the thank you page is book a   quick start call book an implementation call 
whatever you want to call it and they book in   a call with a setter They talk to a setter for 
15 minutes and then they get set with a closer   and then the closer closes them So two call close 
but it is same back end back end Yes low ticket   products are different right low ticket products 
are little pieces little you know info around this   We're super super cognizant of like brand So we 
are not the people who just throw up a PDF and   sell it or do this or that Like so we build out 
full you know info products essentially for these   Um that's why it almost takes us kind of longer 
to launch stuff like this Um so but if your math   is that and you have $50 AOV I'm sorry yeah $50 
net CPA and then it's all about ascension rate So   it's knowing those two numbers If 5% of the people 
ascend you have a $1,000 CPA on your backend thing   F $50 divided by 5% ascension thousand bucks right 
Yeah So that's the game we're playing now Now   the issue with that keeping the net CPA in pocket 
knowing that only 5% do it If you want to sell 20   units a day you have to sell whatever 400 units on 
the front every day which as I'm sure we all know   is difficult to keep within pocket within CPA And 
then you deal with the availability issue the same   way you deal with it on a VSSL optin funnel You 
have to navigate a setter availability calendar   and you have to navigate a closer availability 
cander You have to navigate show rates on a set   call Not to mention not to mention their calendar 
but what they're available to do not to mention   which is and then you can't you can't bump those 
out more than 48 maybe 72 hours or you leave rates   like no other right So it's how tight can you get 
that window to where your ascension happens within   5 days And you're going to get people that are 30 
days later you're going to get those which just   drive that percentage up But like if you're 
looking on day or across you know seven-day   windows that's the game I think it's the best 
one Yeah Have you seen though like a bump with   the setter thing I've always had a hard time with 
that Just me personally Like if you've got them on   the call get them freaking closed Like if you're 
going to say now we have another opportunity for   them to miss a call or to cool off at all Have 
you tested this and you think the setter thing is   working well Yeah So we tested Yes Very well Very 
very well It's the it's the hottest pocket for   setters on show and close rate Wow Setters exist 
in three buckets right now for us They exist as   auto set which is what we're going to call these 
So they get auto bookings on their calendar and   they convert them into closed call sets They get 
self sets which is going to be your classic like   app no books ring the CRM do all those things and 
then they're going to get confirm sets They're   actually confirming all the ad bookings and all 
the marketing bookings So they'll dial them within   1 three five minutes max five uh once they book a 
call and then didn't come from a set and they'll   confirm with them you know it's this time zone 
You know it's a Zoom call Here's what we're going   to cover I saw you put this in your app Is that 
correct Like that kind of stuff The quick start   call is the most interesting because someone is 
now coming in with the framing That's the issue is   the framing because if you send that straight to a 
closer calendar they're going backtoback on people   who booked in who watched the VSSL that knew this 
was a program they were applying for and doing   this You then your next call is coming from low 
ticket ascension and the framing was here's your   quick start Yeah Your quick start implementation 
on this There's no edification There's no you know   they're basically thinking they're getting out 
with a CS rep without you know titling it as that   They think they're getting out with someone to 
help them with that which in all fairness they   are when they talk to a setter right It's oh 
did you get your access Okay here's what you   got Cool Yes And then a very quick transition to 
okay and why didn't you apply for the coaching   And it's like oh what coaching right I just saw 
an ad because you're spending 30 grand a day or   whatever Like or you know these guys there's other 
people in the space you know spending hundreds of   thousands of dollars a day to low ticket And 
it's like why did why did you not apply for   coaching All the results you see on the website 
come from coaching You're going to get all this   personalization You're going to get this And then 
set them with the closer So those the sets from   that have the highest show rate and the highest 
close rate of anything in the company Wow that's   pretty awesome man I do I think over the next 18 
months that low ticket funnel is going to be the   most profitable That's my prediction live on 
ClickFunnels radio We'll see The big thing for   us and it's so funny but we talking about what 
you said earlier of you know problem solution   product right Like this product exists kind of 
like in that middle It's not it's not built in   a way that is sell 500 units of it a day which 
is a ceiling that we can hit of is it 50 is it   150 is it 300 units you can sell a day remaining 
in there and more so thus far for us has acted as   almost like a retargeting asset because we have 
so many emails and so many things So you'll get   buyers and they're already in our system from four 
years ago or a year ago or a month ago Um which   is great and the math works and like they're just 
coming back into the funnel and now they're going   through the proper funnel to get on the right call 
and do that with the right framing but it is not   something you can mass sell a thousand units of 
a day because of how it's framed and what the   product is More so about how what it or how it's 
framed than what it is is currently more kind of   the in the weeds example right It's like the oh 
specific this weight training or the specific this   thing that is not somebody who's mass market who 
doesn't know anything about this yet it exists for   someone that kind of has some awareness So that's 
with the rebuild So that's where we're going with   this on how we build this So that funnel style can 
work for us at mass scale Yeah you could just test   other frontends too right To even worry about like 
like the different like you mentioned whatever   unit plateaus you feel like you're going to hit 
just opening up so there's different pieces of a   pie to where they're scratching different niches 
and all kind you know nerds Um yeah No no you're   100% right And like but then then going back to 
the same thing is brand is so important to us   Quality is so important to us that we're not just 
going to whip up a low ticket that we're going to   sell in a weekend Like maybe back in the O OG days 
we would but now with like where we're at with   things it's like goes through the process goes 
through the creative director goes through these   the packaging is there the graphic designer's on 
the back to make sure all the assets look the same   Like you guys know how it goes as it showed Yeah 
Yeah You kind of slow down over time versus when   we were in Bali us three and I first met them in 
person and like this whole thing We shot a course   in the living room and sold it like the next day 
and like it was still great quality information   but like that's just where we were at It's like 
let's film for 12 hours and do 19 iterations of   the VSSL on page until it's perfect And it's like 
you know the those two are rock stars The ones who   the co-founders of this company are rock stars 
They put so much grit and time and like just ram   their head against a wall a thousand times on 
I mean gosh I think of them and him having the   marketing mind and her being the actual one who 
has to you know portray the message and like do   it and him just being like again again again and 
her having to reshoot it and re-shoot it and like   we're all learning it doing it live and like they 
were rock stars They were rock stars 12-hour days   no doubt for years doing this thing That's what 
it takes That's what it takes I just love this too   data data data Like you have to be resilient You 
have to look at this You have to iterate and you   just have to do it And then what works Pick the 
winner and then iterate again Yeah And it's not   just going to be optins Revenue Yeah Yes The path 
is math Yeah People lie Numbers won't I like that   one I like that one Yeah Ryan question for you 
Uh you're a student of the game clearly given the   library that's behind you I want to get into books 
in a second but my first question is maybe you can   pick an honorable mention if you'd like to you 
uh one thing I want to commend you on and Russell   taught us this I mean god since Chris and I were 
children but um always invest in yourself like   right never be afraid to pull out your credit card 
and buy information You have bought a plethora   of courses What sticks out to you What's made 
the most impact for you in your career Um it's   been when we're in a pinch or we want to learn 
something new and I can just devour it and it's   it's solving a specific problem that we have right 
So like we have paid more I mean like mid hundreds   of thousands for stuff once we've already been up 
and running that oh we don't understand how this   works in sales management or whatever and we buy 
the thing for five grand or now internet marketing   land everything's 20 G's but uh it's like that or 
the like when we were doing the initial launch I   had bought Becker's thing cuz I wanted to crack 
YouTube and it was also about info products   and VSSLs and that was like life-changing We had 
bought consulting.com ovens had the most thorough   products ever at the time and like we bought 
that and that's then how I met Luke as well   and then we operated based on a bunch of stuff 
that was in there Um Cole Gordon has fantastic   stuff and we bought his stuff um at the time and 
like you know he his multiple hybrid approaches   and then his like marketplace side of things His 
stuff's been fantastic Oh I made a video on this   that was like I'm not a guru but I buy everyone's 
course like thing And it's just like wherever I   have an interest at the moment I've now allowed 
myself to kind of just freely aimlessly do this   Uh just with the understanding that I am not going 
on a side quest I'm doing it for fun Um but the   ones that have been really really impactful have 
been the ones that have directly over overlapped   We bought Alen Sultanic's ultimate what our 
automatic thing and like it's like 20 bucks   or something and next thing you know I'm buying 
NHB and I'm learning this and I end up seeing our   CMO as like a guest speaker in there before he was 
our CMO and more so for me thus far has been the   people we've met in there and then the quick wins 
we can add because you're at when you're scaling   into something you are learning how someone else 
does it but applying it to your situation which   sometimes cannot work let's be like let's be 
honest because it's not in the same conditions   but sometimes can be a massive multiplier effect 
Like if you can pay 5 grand 20 grand or if you can   just learn something one little golden nugget when 
you're doing a million a month and it changes a   five or 20% swing or whatever number it's large 
and it pays for these 5K courses or 1K or 15K   thing like really really quick That's the whole 
idea of the masterminds It's like you're paying   30 grand a year 50 grand a year 100 grand a year 
but you get in the right room and whether it's a   person you meet that changes it or it is a little 
golden nugget that you change to up your opt-in   rate by 3% it's like you made 100 grand back No 
doubt No doubt So totally honorable mentions are   probably those OG ones just because they were so 
impactful and where we were of learning was just   like very baseline Um but yeah some of the more 
tactical ones that we've bought and implemented   throughout the years has have been some definite 
like definite needle boos That's awesome it I   was actually in a mastermind This is a dumb 
story but since I've already opened my mouth   um we were at lunch and he was saying that the 
best advice he ever got from a mastermind he   shared at this table was if you ever get sued 
use a lawyer that has the same last name as you   And you're like "Look this is my cousin We can 
kick the can down the road as long as you want   Like you might as well just leave me alone cuz I 
can whatever." Yeah Yeah Cuz I can go forever It's   not non-billable It's nonillable My lawyer is free 
It's my brother So we can keep doing this for as   long as you want And my sister's an attorney That 
could be my golden nugget of this dude I was like   that could save tens of like I mean I was like 
that's worth the adission right there So anyone   listening to this Yeah take that with you Um Chris 
we got to get into seg segments real quick I know   we're almost kind of stretching it Yeah let's do 
some segments real quick All right cool Sements   Uh yeah brought to you by clickfunnels.com our 
sponsor today Go to ww.clickfunnfunnels.com and   listen carefully Click start a free trial 14 days 
on us Don't worry about it We've covered the cost   for you Go ahead and check it out You're going 
to like it Chris hit rhyme with some segments   All right So here's what we're going to do This 
one is going to be um well actually you know what   We're we'll start with Hero to Zero to Hero So 
here's the deal And I think I kind of know what   you're going to say but especially now that you 
know what you're I mean like all these numbers   Do you remember the book that Russell did a 
few years back 30 days It was literally hey   if you lost everything and had to start over from 
scratch you don't have your name you don't have   your reputation you're looking on your bookshelf 
for so you know exactly what I'm talking about   So we're going to play this All right there you 
go Ryan you've lost everything and you got to get   back on top What's the strategy that you're going 
to implement in the first 30 days Nobody knows who   you are You don't have any money but you have 
your skill set What do you do I am going to do   the exact model I'm in now I have the skills right 
You got the skills I just have no money and no and   no network Yeah Okay Yeah No I would go and find 
somebody that's a non make money online personally   Uh for example I heard somebody that was doing it 
with how to grow the largest pumpkin in the world   uh and got up to insane numbers but I would 
build an expert business 100% I would partner   with somebody uh if I had the skill and the 
case studies you can get majority all day   uh ownership of that thing and you own all the IP 
you own the brand you own the domain and then you   have an expert in it And I would rip a call funnel 
I would have a higher ticket offer because there's   more room for error and more cash flow in it than 
low ticket Too much iteration on low ticket for me   and where my skill set stack lies Um and I would 
do that and control the narrative You can get   feedback on the phone calls and run it And then 
there's backup and then there's low ticket and   then there's team and there's whatever But like 
yeah if you need to get to 100 grand a month like   that like that's it for me Love it It's a good 
answer Super cool Yeah it was fantastic Ryan for   for people that are watching for people that are 
listening right now um that live under rock don't   follow you where do we send them Where can they 
go find more information from you and learn more   Yeah Uh I just started doing YouTube 80 something 
days ago and I've uploaded every single day with   a lot of tactical stuff in the beginning and 
breakdowns and funnels and math and tracking and   all of that and then has now transitioned into me 
doing some like interviews with cool people like   you guys So uh yeah just my name on everything 
X Instagram YouTube all just my name and you'll   find it Go follow him Great job Ryan This is 
fantastic We appreciate you man Great interview   I didn't even I didn't even get to plug you guys 
for for your 1.0 but this is no joke This is   uh we use all of our order forms for our sales 
reps are still on ClickFunnels That's awesome   Love that So we have 30 Yeah 30 of those Low 
ticket still on ClickFunnels The only stuff   that's not is like the main funnels that are 
on our main branded stuff But yeah we still use   Click Funnels on everything Love it Everything 
Cool Thank you so much Ryan Yeah Talk soon guys

# made $3M+ in 30 days selling INFO here is how... | EP81
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0gT_KCTuY

What's up, guys? In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we made $3,40,780 last month in total cash collected in our info coaching business. Here's a Stripe screenshot to verify. This is for the month of May, and today is June 1st, and I just took this screenshot 3 minutes ago. I'm going to break down marketing, sales, fulfillment, and tech departments. We're going to talk about what worked, what did not work, things we changed, and then I'm going to break down the marketing systems and funnels we use to acquire these customers. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in this in this business and we've now crossed over 75 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. No mentorship, no courses, consulting, nothing. All I'm doing is sharing what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company opportunities and network with cool people doing cool stuff. All right, so let's get into it. So just took the screenshot for you guys. We're going to bounce around a little bit here, but let's start with sales. So sales was the biggest change up and as you can see you can go back on the channel and I shared last month's where we did 1.62. Um but the biggest change for us that happened month overmonth was sales. So we got a new cso. Um I actually used this system from people I met in uh YouTube and X to find a chief of sales and he came in and very strong personality, very strong um changes that he made and put in place. But the energy overall shifted. So we had I think one or two sales reps that ended up leaving um during that time and kept the same team, the same lead flow, the same everything from marketing, same volume and we produced 87% more and they actually started around this range right here. Uh which is just crazy. So with that he changed script. So we were not super strong held on the scripting that was happening or what was being used there. So uh more it was just I don't want to say softer is maybe the wrong word but it was kind of a more lax situation prior and now we're coming in and being more numbers driven script uh script driven and focused around these specific things and also rolled out a deck that we use. So going through all of those, the real big changes were the overall energy, the expectations, the scripting, how we're doing the actual pitch, uh how the cadence of the meetings is happening, how the onetoone cadence is happening, just like the overall management of that department. Um there are going to be es and flows with that. There are going to be personality issues, there's going to be communication differences and issues, uh there's going to be expectation issues. So we are still navigating this. Um just to be very transparent with like how, you know, hard or soft or where we want to live in this in terms of culture and how this fits. Um because everyone on the team is great and is important to us. It just depends on you know where they fit with how high performance the culture gets. Um and that's everywhere. That's across every department. That's across every um chunk or department of the company uh across leadership and across you know boots on the ground. So yeah this was a really big change for us. I'm happy to go into more into this if you guys want to drop some comments or questions. Um but all this is pretty I don't say standard but it just became the expectation that didn't exist before which is pretty crazy for us. So close rate big increase uh cash collected in revenue per call big increase all of that just from the sales portion. So getting into the fun uh getting into the fulfillment and then we're going to go tech and go marketing at the end because that's usually your guys' favorite where I'll then share the funnels. But for us uh up until last Monday, the only thing we sold was one hero product. So we sell annual coaching. Um and right now we actually only have a little bit of info we sell. It's a majority coaching where it's a onetoone uh annual agreement for coaching. So, it's onetoone with a coach. Um, I like to view the models as, you know, down from info, coaching with you, group with you, uh, coaching one-on-one with a coach, coaching group with a coach. And we lived in this one with a coach. Okay. So, only backend we had was more of the same. So, they could just purchase another year or continue on their membership. And we just rolled out group um, I'm sorry, yes, actually group for the back end. So we now have two different offerings where they can either basically downell on a continuity where they stay in a group coaching capacity or they can do multi-year of that and like there's these different options for the back end. So we have a retention team in place. There's a lot of evolution that's going to come from this. I'll make probably complete dedicated videos on this uh in the future of how we optimize this because it's nowhere near optimized. We just launched it. Um but this was new to us. So we launched that portion comp changes uh to the overall team where we better align them. Um you know we're kind of doing this all from the hip and trying to learn as we go. Um but against industry comps, you know, trying to be in those right ranges, um trying to make it efficient for them so they can take XYZ clients across the coach load. Um but what we finally came out with was something that was really good with like tenure with uh tenure um pay with things that have comp uh competitions and contests internal and then made it easier in terms of like admin as well for how they get bonused across based on client load with an expectation of X base with X clients and then can climb, you know, based on as they get more. uh we had the tiers probably too far apart on this first iteration of it. So it was harder to reach these other ones or it was more inconsistent if they had clients leave or newcome or if the lead flow was slow. So this was a big change that we made um that I think is really beneficial to everyone to the company for cleanliness and like admin side as well as for the team to know you know where they sit in comp. Client wins channel is exploding which is amazing to see. That's like the lifeblood of this entire company. So, spinning back around all the way over to marketing and how they use these then for uh marketing assets, uh website assets, all that stuff. Um, and then just overall, right, it's like reviews fly in the it's just it's the lifeblood when you see that, you know, your thing actually gets results, that your that your uh program or your company actually gets good results. So, this was a really big win for us. Um, there's a ton in the channel that are now used also across these. And the one thing I'm not saying here is how I'm sitting right now is basically like over these. So I have like a direct lead of all of these that I'm working with and I'm trying to grow in the skill set to be basically operating those different leads and not necessarily be in the weeds of all of them but understanding what's happening and then you know basically operating through project managing through data. So this is another huge one. We have had very inconsistent and messy data when it comes to fulfillment. Basically everything that happens after marketing and sales. I've owned this process forever. Um and I have extremely good data in marketing and sales but once it hits fulfillment it just sits in fulfillment. It's the same reason we probably didn't have a back end is like the tracking of that, the activation points, the when is someone good to talk to about a renewal. We didn't even have something to offer them for a renewal. So, there was a lot of stuff around this that just wasn't there. So, we ended up partnering up um or more so paying this company um to come in and is going to restructure all the data, how we do things with automations, flow, and data storage. Uh right now, we're in HubSpot and like nine Google Sheets basically, and we're moving all of that to a centralized place to have like a source of truth. Um which then rolls right over into into tech because it's the same thing. So tech is owning this and the tech leads and stuff are owning this portion with fulfillment and then it immediately bleeds over into sales and marketing. Uh marketing not as much and I'm going to get to that next. Um but sales for sure because of cash collection, because of invoicing, um because of renewals, which are also acting as a sales function, all those things tying together. So it's going to be a huge overhaul of how we do all things data. And I'm sure I'll make a complete dedicated video on this of like how we land. Um, but whether we fully go into HubSpot with all our data, whe whether we use this likely data lake, uh, external system and then connect back into, uh, it's going to be super super good. So, uh, I'm very excited for that. I don't know the exact timeline of it, but this team is like fully leading it and then getting all the context from here. And then eventually we'll have to pull all the stuff from sales for, um, because that's how we currently track everything for commissions and, uh, renewals and refunds and what's new versus active and all that stuff exists over here. And that needs to all be centralized into these. So, I'm pretty excited for that one. marketing tech is brand new actually so it's not even really in effect for this last month um but just hired someone finally this is a position that I do that I have always clicked the keys I build the funnels um even if we have a designer do some stuff I do all the data connections the custom fields the storage the reporting all that um so finally hired someone who is a pro in this from XYZ past company and is coming over with a ton of experience in our exact tech stack which is going to be very exciting for us uh and mainly for me because uh I call it clicking of the keys but like 80% of my clicking of the keys work is still that or probably more and if I can get out of that then I have more time and space to really you know problem solve and identify and strategize on how we can take some of these departments and and think ahead and just be more proactive versus oh hey can we connect this new funnel or do this new split test and like I'm still in the weeds doing that so this will be a big help for us cost savings we did a big approach we changed up a lot of things we do with our chart of accounts and in the P&L so that we could identify things that fall into XYZ bucket and we are moving things in the direction of cost savings for software for licenses for users as well as automation ations. We've had a very very heavy Zapier setup and all that kind of stuff. Sorry if this is boring, but this is this is life. Um, but we've had a lot of that. So, we're moving things over to NAND and some of these other automation softwares for some of the higher volume ones that don't require as many steps um and can just be executions. So, that's a huge one. So, tens of thousands of savings um potentially on a monthly basis. We're already close to 10 uh in savings a month, which is amazing. And then project systems. So, I want to talk about this one as kind of what I was saying is overarching. um I built a master operations thing. So we used to basically all meet us plus some other people within these departments as this one master operations meeting and we've now transitioned and shifted that to being one master board. We have only some key people here and then in one meeting where it's like cross sync and then we have division specific meetings. So we meet specific around tech, specific around fulfillment, specific uh around people, specific around sales and specific around marketing. Uh and then they have their meetings within their cadence. So we're trying to get to a point where it's a little more I don't get corporate is maybe the wrong word but structured and how we do that and with that comes structured project systems and data. So what data exists for them? What's reported? What is in the meetings? What is on the agendas? Uh and then how is the project flow. So we built this masterboard. We use ClickUp. I've heard people use Asana and Air Table. I actually really like Air Table because it's a little more technical uh in my opinion. But we're on ClickUp. So uh in there we have this master list and things are segmented down by their department and then also based on like what's cross sync versus department which touches other ones of these and then how do they have sublists we've moved all of the individual teams from the people who live in let's call it sales for example like sales ops setter ops uh management um that's something else I didn't talk about in sales the setting divi the setting division has been a big help for this they do now do um call uh confirmations for the marketing bookings they do uh auto sets from the low ticket stuff which I'll get into all those here We're going to actually talk about that more. And then they also do um so self sets, confirmed sets, and auto sets. Uh and they're crushing. They're hitting really, really good numbers. And you know, everyone who talks to them has a much higher show rate and a much higher close rate. Uh it's just getting them the tech and tools and system to make sure that they can hit the most amount of people in the most efficient way possible, which is a big push into next month. Um but back to the project systems. So yeah, so we basically centralized all this into one. So people can see the other departments, they can see cross sync, they can see who is, you know, assigned. We're on a big like one person is the champion of this. There may be multiple people that need to touch it for it to get over the finish line. Um, but one person is in charge of when this is due. So things essentially sit in, you know, the worst word ever phrase ever in in online, but like the parking lot, they sit in an idea bank and then they move to to-do and as soon as they go into to-do, they get a due date and they get one champion and that is like hard. So we're using the due dates as the priority and then cycles through there and then they move into in progress and then completed or blocked depending. Um, so yeah, that's been a really big kick for us. The big change here, if I'm boring you guys, I'm sorry, but this is again life. Uh, was the big change in the sales and then what everything that happened with marketing prior. So, if you watch through these videos, this is the day 81 I believe in a row of doing these. We were bleeding out, right? Like there was we were breaking even, bleeding out, not good. And we needed to fix marketing, we fixed marketing, and then sales was not backing out. And we were like, "Oh, it's still marketing problem." But really what it was is very clearly a sales thing. Um because as soon as we changed some of the sales leadership, some of the energy, got some at bats for some of the newer reps and just in general. Um all the changes that happened here, we went from call it 70 to 70k day. I mean I guess what is it? 80k if it was 1.6. Um to that math doesn't math whatever you know what I mean. Uh it was that 40k day. 48 12. No, I'm blanking so hard. No, it's like five six. Yeah, six. Um so of those never do public math. That's for my first million. But we jumped tound and something consistent days just from that. So that change with what was already existent in marketing is crazy. So now we're like really really doubling down on marketing so that this can continue and then we just need to scale this linear and then make sure that this continues to drive cost down and quality up which is like a dance right so CMO still in place crushing it. He is he's brought so much good to the company. We're now growing the team, which I'll talk about down here, but he is just like he can be boots on the ground and like in the weeds and he can also zoom out and see the overarching things. So, he's just crushing it for us and consistently filling the calendars for these sales reps with quality people uh at good economics like the costs are in alignment. Um, so let's break down the funnels real quick. So, this is a chart I've used a lot of times. I'm just going to talk about what some of the updates are. So, we run essentially three core funnels, right? So, you're going to see the different colors here. So, the first one is going to be our VSSL opt-in funnel. It's how we did 71 million of our total thing before we rolled out any of these other ones. Um, and still is actually a majority. But so they come in, they opt in. We only do name and email. We do not do phone number just because we don't use AI tools or set or setters or anything to where the justification for the decrease in optins you get when you ask for phone number. Um, they then watch VSSLs. Then when they watch the VSSL, it is uh cookied to where um the timer comes up at the CTA, which is 80% of the way through, but you have their email so you can remarket to them. They then apply. they get routed whether on the quality of that. Um, some people do income, some people do all these other things. We use one that's like based on how much they've invested in themselves in the past because it's just like our market. Um, they land on a specific booking thing. They either book with this one or this one. Everything looks the same for them. They get on a sales call and they close. DTA, this one we have running kind of small, but we're testing a bunch of different things on this, but this is what most people I've seen an info coaching run. So, this is going to be your headline, VSSL, and then application button. Some people run it so it's delayed for 5 minutes. Some people let it show immediately. Um, but you just got to kind of play that game. And this one for us, uh, is actively running. We tested three different. We found one winner or it's like still it's it's good, but it's not like fantastic. So, this is just kind of in the pause range. And then this is our other like big one that we're optimizing. Um, so we have a low ticket funnel that is built for ascension. So, what some what's going to happen is someone's going to see an ad, they're going to come to a landing page. It's a long form sales page. You can look at like Alen Sultanic and those guys. They talk a lot about this on economics and they crush it. Um, and it's a long form sales page where they then go to purchase and they put in their name, email, and click next. Brings them to a checkout. So, you get that opt-in, but they're like in the process of checking out. So, like kind of a two-step. They'll check out here and then we get, you know, 50% call it, let's say that then fill this out. So, you have your drop off rate. And then the big thing here is instead of then having Otto's where it's more cash, you're trying to like offset and get into profit with what we're trying to do is just liquidate here and then push them into booking a call. So they book a call on the thank you page that's framed as like a quick start call and they will talk to a setter. Once they talk to a setter, they will then get pushed over which is right here actually. Right? Then they will get pushed to set to talk to a closer and then close. So there's obviously massive drop off. So you know let's say 90% drop off here, 50% drop off here, 40% 50% drop off here, 40% drop off here, right? And like you get down this, but the economics on it still are insane. So, it's all about what you can get your net CPA to. So, let's say you can get it to $100, right? So, it cost you $150 to sell a product that's 50 bucks. So, the net is h 100red and then whatever percent of these people back out into closes over here. You could just do your division. So, let's say it's $100 and you get 6%. That's a $1,600 CPA um on your backend product and all of this and the amount of volume you have through here. And it's the time, too. So, I can go into these like really in depth. Um, but yeah, we're changing a lot of things on this to make it more cold friendly because ours currently acts as more of a retargeting asset because we have so many people in the pipeline for years of doing this. Um, it doesn't necessarily crack cold at the same rate. We're testing things like order bumps to increase the AOV on this but not add things on the back end because we don't want to uh because we're trying to focus on the ascension rate and the time from low ticket to high ticket uh which is this portion right here. Um, but what you can do is increase prices. You can uh add order bumps. You can have multi-point checkout. You can do like all these different little things in here um that we're optimizing around right now. So that's the general on the funnel. Um the other piece which I think I have on here next. No. So new hires. So we have crazy new hires coming on. So we're building a bunch of stuff out in this team. I'm trying to re in costs so we don't get to a point where we're just raise opex and you know stay at the same thing. Um but we're basically hired out to 5 billion plus a month for sure. Um other than some of these like linear ones like uh coaches for example or sales uh reps. Um, but like the actual overhead style team or like department over here, tech doesn't need to get bigger. Uh, marketing doesn't need to get bigger. Uh, HR doesn't need to get bigger. CS shouldn't really need to get bigger until a little bit later and then it's like one or two. Um, but these can be like, you know, 510 increases. Um, so in that new hires that are coming, we have V uh editors that are coming online. Um, we had a like acquisition style copywriter that came on. So we had an graphic designer that came on. So just some really core cool hires that are also have worked in industry with the same that our CMO has. So like they have a lot of overlap which is fantastic because they have good working culture already um because they already had it in the past. So that was a big one. Brand faces. This was big. So this VSSL funnel we're actually technically running two right now with brand face one. Um that is is what I'm going to say brandace one and that's like co-founder. That's one we've done everything on so far and we have two other brand faces that we're testing. We use them in ads currently um because the goal is to get out of founder risk and like if we ever do sell or whatever I understand it's a pipe dream 99.999% never sell um but 99.99 probably never try. So we may try but in doing that you need to make sure that you have diversification on the front end um that there's no founder risk or you know specific point risk. So having multiple brand faces that are in the demo of who we sell to is something we are moving towards. We use them in ads right now and they work really well but they are working to a funnel that is then someone else. So call it branded 2 ad goes to Brandface one VSSL and that's just like not congruent. So we now have VSSLs that are being built that are going to be for those as well. So we'll have one, two, three, four of those. We likely will then test them on DTA and we likely will then build out low tickets for them. So you could say we could have upwards of six to nine of these. And with one VSSL funnel we did 70 whatever million. So if we do this right and we optimize these correctly and we don't get you know shiny object and we move from one to the next to the next and make sure that you know when you leave the other one it's at the scale it needs to be or can get and we're not just doing it to do it. Um, I think we're going to be in a really healthy place with marketing that then it'll just all land into sales and how much sales can do. And then if sales is the breakpoint and whatever culture people things, uh, close percent, whatever it is, if they crush that, then it lands into fulfillment, making sure that that's good. And we're trying to get ahead of that proactively with the data, the systems, um, aligning comps, making sure that, you know, client wins are in place and the feedback loops there and trying to think ahead for that solve. And then last piece is an organic engine. So almost I mean 99% of our first click comes from these through paid ads. So we spend pretty heavily um on paid advertising in order to achieve these results and we have a ton of organic stuff. We have you know thousands of hours of videos to probably tens of thousands of hours of videos and just we've never really cracked it to where organic is our first click and that is something that the more I venture into YouTube and X and all the stuff I see. So we're going to make a concerted effort to push in that direction to start to build out an organic engine so that we can because right now all of it acts basically as middle and bottom of funnel and the target is for it to be first click right and to actually generate cold audience uh which would be amazing um because as we all know organic is really helps the P&L obviously but also it's just you know they're higher quality they show to calls better they close on calls better they just have more consumption they're warmer they're not doing it sitting on their couch at 9:00 p.m. because they saw an ad for 12 seconds, right? Like the consumption is huge. Um the trust is huge that exists. So if we can build that out, that would be fantastic. And then yeah, just so much more to come. So like I said, there's always people problems. There's always things that are going to happen. There's there's a lot of problems, right? It's like it's just what kind or what level. So there's, you know, people problems, there's uh data problems, there's all these things that we're trying to navigate. Um funnel things broke like crazy. But yeah, overall it was a it was a good second half of the month leaning in and I'm excited for what we're going to do into this month. I'm not going to project really out because we might have some shifts in what we do volume-wise or across this, but like we're in the right direction. So, I'm very excited about that. Um, and yeah, I'll be able to update you guys into next month. Today was day 80 of doing these videos. I'm doing interviews with a bunch of cool people that I've met in the space that are in um online marketing in general. So, lead genen, paper call, uh, info coaching, SAS, all the things, e physically, ecom. So, I've been doing a lot of those videos as well as some of these training style videos are just sharing what's working for us or what has exploded for us. Um, you can see them all here, www.rroncl.comdoc. I sort them by tech, marketing, sales, ops, fulfillment, or actually maybe not fulfillment, mindset. Um, but you can see them here. And then, yeah, hit me on IG or X if you guys have any questions. I love when you guys comment below these. It feeds the elgo and also gives me some perspective on what's helpful or not. Today was probably a little more boring I would feel for you guys um based on just kind of how I was sharing and what it was. But this is this is it. It's more the same at a certain point. It's restructuring. It's building. It's finding proactive things that will break or reactively fixing things that are on fire or broke. So, we're trying to do, you know, dance the game. Always solve the thing that's right there. And what's the one big thing? What's the current bottleneck? Right now, we would say it's probably sales. Next, it'll very likely be fulfillment and tech and data. So, we're trying to solve for that ahead of time. Um, but yeah, then it'll probably be marketing again. So, it's always something. Um, but I'm excited for where we're going. So, appreciate you guys and uh I'll talk to you soon.

# How William Brown Made $20M+ Selling Courses | EP80
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuSlY0xDoko

What's up, guys? In today's video, we have a banger. We have William Brown coming from Bali. So, we're on a 12 uh 12 hour time zone difference. Got 4 a.m. and 4 pm over here. William, kick it off. Everyone knows who you are, but let's hear the intro. Yeah, for sure, man. I mean, people know me best for uh the last e-learning company that I grew from 0 to 16.4 mill over five years and then sold last year to High View, a private equity firm in America. But I've really been doing entrepreneurial stuff since I was super young. You know, when I was skateboarding, I decided to film and edit videos and try and sell them to my friends. When I was doing graffiti, I started a graffiti magazine. Uh when I got into music, I started making my own records and then got signed to a decent label and that was my first ever proper career. I DJed in over 45 countries all over the world. Learned a lot from that that I carried into business. Then I started uh trading financial markets to make more money. That turned into the e-learning company. And yeah, when I when I exited that company, my plan was just to have a one person business, you know, I didn't want to have a team. I didn't want to run paid ads. That almost killed me in in the last business. To to me, it was just so [ __ ] stressful, man. The ads, the team. And when I was lucky enough to exit, honestly, my plan was just make a few YouTube videos, get a few one-to-one coaching clients, and and just chill. The YouTube channel grew really, really, really fast, right? Right off the bat. And uh all of a sudden, I've got another [ __ ] consulting company now. And it takes us to where we are today. Yeah, absolutely. It's so funny because I I didn't know who you were prior and I was probably one of those I definitely was one of those people who was served that like initial video those first couple that you just uploaded that were just raw just like unfiltered. I hadn't heard of your stuff before and I was like oh interesting like you give to me and you know the OGs or OGs of our era remember the oven stuff and like you just give that that thought process that vibe and you know he crushed he crushed. So I want to deep dive this. So usually these are pretty tactical. We've got, you know, mid6 figure guys, seven figure a month guys, uh, are kind of like the main pocket and then of course you're going to have your beginners that are going to come through here. So, let's break into the company because and I want to give some context and pick your brain selfishly, but like what was the what was the actual monetization models? What was the whole what was the whole last business that you just sold? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was 95% paid ads driven. So, we had a tiny bit of organic, but it was for the most part it was faceless. It it was it was really pretty much just paid ads driven, massive sales team. When I sold the company, it was a team of nine closers, three setters, sales team manager, three coaches, and a support guy and a bookkeeper and and blah blah blah. And it's funny, the month that we signed the LOI was actually our biggest ever month. We did an offer we did at 824K and that helped with the sale price a bit because they actually captured that month in the the the price when they calculated the the ebidar. So that was a nice kind of cherry on top. But it was pretty simple. We were just running paid ads uh only YouTube ads into a VSSL booking calls, closing calls. We had one front-end offer which was 6.8K. We had a software but it was making very little. We had a mastermind which was making very little and it was one of those businesses where it's just banging the front end, you know, and it worked pretty well. Yeah. Interesting. And then what was the actual content? You said it was like financial market trading stuff or it was consulting or Yeah, it it was it was a a trading education coaching program. Very, very simple. Two coaching calls a week and a and a course basically. Interesting. Yeah. And all with all with YouTube ads. Only YouTube ads. Yeah. We we tested Facebook ads and they were profitable but nowhere near what what we were doing on YouTube. So we were like let's just go as hard as we can on YouTube. Yeah. And then the 15 mil in rev that was that year that was like in total cash collected and then sold for the Yeah. That that was the total across the five years and then we exited for 2.6x uh evida. Nice. Okay. Yeah. You're one of like the only people, right? I mean you probably know the list better than I do but it's what Hormosi which was licensing but info coaching. it's you. And then I've heard there's a couple others that are in like the low eight figure range, but I I don't know. They're like pretty quiet. Jeremy Haynes talks about them a couple times where he's like, "Oh yeah, you know, we've had clients who do it." And that's I don't want to say the only spaces he works in, but kind of like closer to that. But super interesting that you're one of the, you know, the ones I can count on a hand who've actually done it. It's weird, man. Yeah, there's there's more people that have done it that maybe often you just don't hear about. I heard of one from a friend the other day and I was like, "Wow, I've never even heard of that company or or the exit." So, they're out there, but honestly, I just think that there's a belief in this industry that you can't sell these businesses when Yeah, you absolutely can. You you absolutely can. You know, it's just a case of belief, knowing the process, working with a good maybe M&A adviser, and just knowing what to do really. So, yeah, 100%. Yeah, I have this like I I talk on here. I'm like, you know, 0.001% 01% are going to actually sell in the info coaching space and you know Iman all these guys they all talk about and just hammer it how it's just like never going to happen and then my my thought is of the people that actually try to build for that and actually and actually try and go for it I bet the hit rate's a lot higher than 0.01% 01% right it's in you know s high single maybe double digits of the hundred people that have actually tried to do it there's a handful right which is like much higher hit rate and I I can take that percentage but the 01% is difficult yeah well well dude I I feel like I was very lucky right because I was in I was in a financial literacy mastermind like way back in I think it's 2020 with a guy called Dan Bradbury and the first day of that mastermind we were having lunch and Dan said to me, when do you think you'll sell your business? And he was like fully serious. And I said to him, "Oh, I can't sell this business. It's like a a course coaching business. It's named after me. You can't sell them." And he was like, "Well, yes, you can. The only difference is the buyer and the price. And if you know how to do it and you do it well, you'll sell faster and easier to a better buyer for a better price. And if you don't really know how or you don't do it well, you'll sell to a worse buyer and it'll be harder for a lower price." And to hear that way back in 2020, I think it was, it just planted the seed in my head. I was like, Dan says I can sell this business. He'd sold six, seven, eight other companies, so I I trust him and believe him. And when it came to the end of 2022 when I decided that I wanted to sell, I just went back to Dan and said, "Dude, please can you mentor me through the the exit?" And uh yeah, so maybe I was lucky to have that belief implanted in my head so early, you know? Yeah, 100%. Yeah, I'm super curious on like the actual detail or like what you had to do to set that up because we hear all the things and you watch a hormosi or you know even some of these like I'm in all the groups that are the buy biz sell the online this that and majority of them are not info coaching education um but the things you hear right are like it's so funny though that right you sold anyway and it's like the lean team you had the one traffic source the right you hear all this list of things that you need you know diversification on acquisition both the s the traffic source and the models, right? So like different front-end models, you need no brand face risk. You said it was faceless, right? So that's interesting. The fulfillment needs to, right? Which is crazy. Like that's amazing that you are, you know, kind of edge case where you didn't check all the boxes based on like the quick things I've heard that you hear are like required. Um, but yeah, so I want to give you some context a little bit and then I I want to hear your take on this. So we're at 130 team right now. We did 30 mil last year in cash collected, 75 now in total. Before that we were doing 101 12 million a year and we were selling an info product that was over the phone. So like lifetime access to Kajjabi, you know, the classic basically the ovens model, the group coaching through calls and we were selling that but it was lifetime access. So no MR, no like future state and we didn't really have a backend like that was kind of like you said the volume game but it was very it was like you know a,000 2,000 bucks in that range. So it was a lot of volume and had high margins for a fulfillment side because it's info instead of you know right. So we toggled all we ch we left everything the same. So we left all that traffic source acquisition the funnel to everything and instead on the sales call we just sold a different offer that was onetoone coaching and that's what got us from 10 to 30 right so just basically just a higher ticket offer and now you introduce your ARR more or less because you have annual contracts that then they can go for year two year three and there's like this whole game right so we hammered that with volume everything broke right now you have a whole fulfillment team so you have 70 coaches on the back end like literally 70 coaches 4000 thousand active members. You're going back and forth. You've got that whole side of the business. And then you have the constant game of the hamster wheel of filling the calendars and doing 150 30 minute calls a day across 20ome reps. So you've got 20 to 30 sales reps, management leaders. We did it with no setters up to 72 71 72 million no setters. So we just rolled out setters that whole division and then you've got your whole fulfillment side. And then as you know you then have your ops or middle management leadership HR book like everything you're talking about. So we scaled up so aggressively. We hired before it hurt. We hired when it hurt and margins went from this to this as a percentage. We made more dollars right from 10 to 30 uh in profit but not like you know the margin took a dive and in Q end of Q3 into Q4 acquisition was our major issue. So like CPA was going like this. We're trying to do agency thing instead of doing it in house. So we're paying 130 grand a month to manage a million in ad spend. We similar to you are 99% basically paid first click. We do have a massive content moat that like an organic moat that exists mainly for middle and bottom of funnel right like very very little first click. And yeah we just like completely rebuilt that whole team CMO marketer like this whole thing internal. Now CPA is like like killing it. Now we're doing the same thing with sales. We were, you know, stuck in the mid ones, right? Like 1.5 call it, and like essentially breaking even because of spend and team. Everyone's W2, so we moved everyone W2 in the US. So you got 130 people and you're, you know, 20% more than your 1099 wages. You just go down the list and it's like we're almost building to like you have to be above 1.5 to make money and a month and you have to uh Yeah. And you just have to build this in the direction of like you kind of need, you know, you don't need an exit necessarily to cash flow. really just have to get over that hump until you start to cash flow pretty heavy and then the real goal of what we're doing here with you know W2 and HR and build that out is to get there to get an exit. We have had one brand face we now have multiple brand faces. We've had one acquisition channel the VSSL funnel we now have three and now we have three brand faces so we're going to have nine right different VSSL funnels different low tickets move to the back blah blah blah. So there's like kind of the context, but I'm like where are we going and like what is necessary to diversify here to no founder risk here financials like how do we make this thing so the financials the you know ops and finance side are plugandplay that a PE company looks at it and can you know import it basically into their model in two seconds instead of have two weeks of conversations where we're going back and forth on how they understand things like that's where my frame is and this is still like years to come I'm imagining like to hit the numbers we want to but yeah man. Well, dude, you've successfully given me PTSD there. So, thank you very much. Yeah, it's my life. I'm living in it daily. Yeah, dude. It's Oh, God. I My acquisition was probably the number one most stressful period of my life. I missed my best friend's wedding cuz it was just a few weeks before we closed. It was It was a [ __ ] nightmare, but so so so worth it when we got to it. But anyway, to come to yourself, dude, what number do you want to sell for? I mean, if we do this the right way, I know two guys that have numbers that I want to get to that that use the exact same model that are 12 to 15 million a month right now. And it's like that's not unrealistic for us. Um, you know, that's with core model. We've never optimized for backend, which is like, you know, you can look at the core product as either the back end, the middle, the whatever, but you have some low ticket stuff and then you have the core core thing, which is the onetoone personalized training that's a year-long. And we have not even touched optimizations for multi-year after that. It's in the fitness space. So like have not even touched multi-year after that. Have not touched the downell continuity. So you know you got your personalization now you go into groups. You still get like a little bit of it but you stay for the community the access the app the stuff. So living in there we haven't touched physical products. So supplements we wanted to wait until we were at like 50 million a yearish doing you know good numbers to do supplements in that realm. There's the whole play to do front-end supplements. So like you know we have friends that do 15 million a month as well that are in physical products with one or two SKs like there's a whole game to be played here. Um, but if we do that, you know, to answer your question more directly, that could be, let's say it's 30% margins because obviously paid ads heavy. Let's say that's like the target. You're doing 10 and something. You're doing 20, 30, 40 million in IBIDA. Like, who knows what that could sell for if structured correctly. You know, you hear once you're in the tens and 20s, it's like a 10x. You hear, you hear, you hear, you hear, but like, you know, there could be a couple hundred play or this could be a complete pipe dream and it could just cash flow for x amount of time and just like exist as it exists, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I've I've got you, man. I mean I'm working with a private equity firm right now that are working on an info rollup and one of the first things that they said to me was we need to get above 50 million Ebidar so that we can sell to a a good private equity firm and really do something worthwhile. So my first thought when it comes to you is what do you want to sell for and if it's there's not a software component is is there? No the the only like tech component would be basically community layered on. So like yes, there maybe could be some internal tech at that point, but if it is, it's to service clientele. It's not like a standalone version. Yeah. Yeah. Got it, man. So what do you want to sell for? There's no software. So you're probably going to be classed as a media business like we were when we sold. So if it's anything like what I learned, 2.5 to about 4x was what my uh what what I was told by my M&A adviser when we were going through the process. So working backwards from that, what do you want to sell for? What would the ebidar need to be at, let's say, 3x? And then you need to get to that ebidar. And honestly, if there's one thing that I learned, it's often all this [ __ ] that people say is from people that haven't sold that say like, you need to do this, you need to do this. That's where I'm at. Yeah. You know, it's it's it's it's an interesting one for sure. But dude, I've got no doubt that that you'll get there. It's just a matter of time. Yeah, it's definitely a matter of structure and like if you look at the P&L, you look at whatever right now, like it's pain. I'm going to be completely I'm very honest about that on here. Like I've been making videos for whatever 78 90 whatever days uh 80 days today. And uh I have videos in there in the beginning where it's like we're doing 1.5, we have two days in a row where we lose like like lose lose on day, which is crazy cuz like we didn't we haven't had that for years and we were in a rough spot. like a rough spot and now it has in the last two or three weeks like really flipped on its head. It's you know in the hundred plus a day steady state. Uh and that was just some changes that happened in sales. So like marketing continuing same lead flow and then it's the people thing right at this size for us what we've seen more and more is just like it's the people it's the people. So trying to replace and then trying to keep culture trying to keep um you know performance trying to keep all of that tied in one is is the game that we've gotten to. And like right now, let's say that's sales. Next it'll be fulfillment. I'm sure we already broke marketing, now we're fixing sales and like kind of doing this game. Um, but yeah, I think uh what you said for those targets of call it 3x, you hear all the things and this is where it's like at what point do you almost like bring an M&A in even if it's pre like it, you know, a fractional CFO, fractional CO that comes from private equity. you full hire a COO or CFO that comes in from private equity to run that thing for a year or two to make it so oh yeah these you know ratios are checked these hit this you hear that you get into the you know mid7 or start to get into the eight figure IBI range the multiple clims inherently right and these are all things you just hear that mean nothing until they're actually in an LOI or even until it closes not even the LOI right like and I understand that it's just it's that crazy dynamic of like you're building and you're biting the cash to have it in a place that is ready to sell that could never sell. And like you're just kind of playing that game. You hear the guys talk about it that are like, "Oh, you need, you know, optimize for profit and then if an exit happens, it happens." And that's kind of where my mind's at is like optimize for that number because it will drive an exit anyway. But like the the game of paying for team and making it a machine, biting the whatever five or 10 points that off that of current cash for an exit and a lifestyle, right, that it could be sold or not. There's there's so many things there's so many directions that that I want to go with you. I'm trying to just keep it simple. But if I wanted to exit, right, I would just think to myself, well, what am I going to be classed as in this space? It's going to be media, number one. Number two, what am I likely to get two and a halfx to about 4x ebidar? What do I want to sell for when I know what I realistically want to sell for? I would just get myself to the ebidar that I need to be at to get there. The minute that I'm either at the ebidar or very close, I'd bring in an M&A adviser, okay? Build out an IM that I can take out to market. when I've got the investor memorandum, he can go and start sending that out while we're still stabilizing things. Because that's what happened to us, right? We decided we wanted to sell. I think it was like November 2022 and we didn't have a good offer until I think it was February. We had a VC firm from Canada interested. Two months fell through. Then we had uh High View came along in April, signed the LOI pretty much straight away. and then April, May, June, July, August, September. Yeah. So, it took us pretty much five full months to to sell. But along the way, they were they were kind of teaching me what what they wanted almost. So, it wasn't like we love your business, let's just buy it and and go. It was like, can we do this? Can we implement this? Let's stop doing this. Can we get rid of this? So, we kind of we kind of got it right for them along the way. Yeah. Really? Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. I mean, that's cool for both of you, right? It's like you got your exit and they got the business ready basically right under your helm at some point for the transition. Like that's kind of clean. I mean, obviously the five, six months was probably a bit painful, but the uh Yeah. Also, we almost lost the sale as well. So, I was in England uh cuz I was going to celebrate the sale with my family. So, I was in a hotel in England and I got an email one night from the uh Dominic, my M&A adviser, and he was like, "Oh, Carl wants to have a call with you tomorrow morning. it's it's serious and it's urgent. So, we got on the call and they were basically like, "Yeah, we found all these errors in the P&L and this doesn't match the aging report that you gave us and this is not what you told us." Then we had to quickly, it was super expensive to rebuild the books. So, we almost lost that sale. They knocked a few hundred,000 off and and went ahead in the end. Yeah. But even right up to the last day, I was like hating my [ __ ] life to say the least. So, stressful, but worth it. Did you uh so what was the purpose for them to buy it like how what was their plan because right they and kind of two things it's like what was the deal structure and the reason I asked that is because like are you along for the ride on the next step right is there like some portion of it and then also what was their plan and why are they willing to pay you know 3x or whatever number for this what's their plan with it yeah for sure so the deal structure I sold them 80% of the company for 2.6x 6x ebidar kept 20% for myself. Uh they gave me 38% cash up front and the rest in a payment plan over two years with 10% interest added uh per year. They made me stay in. So we closed on September 29th. They made me stay in until January 1st and just do pretty much a call with them every day to hold a hand and and get them uh integrated. And the reason that they wanted to buy us was to turn us into a SAS or add a SAS element, grow the company and resell it. That's why they they wanted to buy us. And one of the key drivers for them was our paid ads. So we'd we'd never ever ever had a losing month on the paid ads in god three odd years. Nice. And when they saw that, that gave them a lot of peace of mind to see, you know, every single one that ever has been at least profitable. And uh the team pretty much everyone we ever hired was was still there on the the last day, give or take a couple of sales reps. So I think they just saw how stable it was. They like the model, they love the profitability, and they thought that they could add to it and uh and grow it and resell it, which is is still the goal for them. So yeah. So how's it going for them? Cuz that was what you said a year ago. It was Yeah. Where it's about a year and a half ago now. Okay. And then So yeah. So you hold 20%. So you're still getting your monthly updates and like you are you guys doing distributions out of it? Is it like a in the future only no cash flow? It is an in the future only uh scenario. So I hear from them every four, five, six weeks with an update. I've got to meet with the partners every now and again to steer them in the right direction. Anything big that they do, they still run it by me when they make kind of like major pivots. Um, and otherwise, they're just building for that future goal of their next exit. Really? Yeah. So, yeah. Cool. Have they uh have they made some aggressive changes? You could say that. You could say that. Yeah. This is something maybe we should talk about uh when this is not being recorded because I'm Yeah, it's fine. No, no, no. 100%. Yeah. I was joking. we'll we'll talk on here and like not docs. We're like we don't have to say numbers, we don't have to say people, we don't say anything. Like no need. Of course, dude. I I've already name dropped off the people anyway, but they've definitely made some changes where I was like that is really really not a a good idea. Within about about 14 days of the acquisition, they lost probably one of the most important people in the company because they just didn't get along. like the the the kind of guy that came in to lead. Some people just didn't resonate with him and and rightly so. Even though the team knew that we were selling in in advance, everybody knew that we were selling. They had to because they were interviewing all the team and interviewing all the customers and going through everything. But there was a couple of people that when they bought they were like, "Yeah, we just don't want to be here anymore. This is not the vision that we signed up for." You know, which is which is fair enough. I think that's always going to happen. but still going to this day, still building and growing, still profitable, still still doing doing what they want to do. So, yeah. Yeah. Very cool. And then when you said they were buying, you know, they're a big fan of the acquisition side of the business. Is that for you guys? Is that like an in-house? And I I don't know where this is based out of or what the W2 comparable is, but like for us, we've heard having, you know, basically an agency or contractors that run any piece of the business is like this inherent risk because they could just walk, you know, with 14-day notice based on whatever 1099 agreement. Like did you guys have the team inhouse and that they were buying this acquisition team at at some level? Did you have it outsourced? Like how'd that work? It's funny. I asked my lawyer Poppy this this question. I said like, "What if I ever want to take some of those team members with me into the next thing?" And she said, "Well, that's illegal. You can't poach them. You can't take them with you, but you can't stop them quitting. You know, the PE firm can't stop them from quitting on their own back and coming to work for you." So, she was like, "It's a bit of a weird weird area, but you can't stop people from leaving." No. You know, but I think this is why it's so important. If I was going to buy a business, man, I would really want to spend time with that team and be like, "Listen, this is what I want to do. This is what I'm going to do. Are you a part of this? Be honest. Are you going to leave on me when I buy this [ __ ] thing so I can start rebuilding another team?" And they were smart enough to do that. You know, they [ __ ] interviewed people some people god knows how many times before they bought. So, yeah, they they clearly knew what they were doing. But but to answer your question more directly, dude, uh they were all contractors. H interesting. Yeah, we to we pulled triggers so early. We were in it was this past summer and it was like the peak of peaks like we were doing like 2.7. We were doing a spe we didn't we do internal specials are like the only like actual promos we do and it'll be basically the second year for a discounted rate and we'll crack like 2 million bucks in like a week and we'll just do like this whole thing into the next one. So, I I think our top month was 3.7 something. Like, we're like on this high. We're like, "All right, let's get in this direction. Everything's perfect. Momentum's there." Uh, but CPA was rising and we're like, we're cognizant of that, but we're still filling calendars. We're just like trying to figure it out, but not hard enough or not well enough probably. And, uh, moved everybody, whole company, 1099 to W2, that whole process, 37 states, x amount of countries that are still 1099, but on a different agreement, like everyone need all these systems and then it was like boom. So you got everyone on salary now. So everyone's, you know, sales reps as an example are making draws. So they have their 45K a year base and then once they cross over that in commission, the commission just takes over. But you have half filled calendars and you have people who maybe don't perform, you know, all mixed into one and you all of a sudden the floor there's a literal floor now of whatever it is. I think it's 1,600 bucks or whatever for every pay period and you've got 20 30 of them that exist and like you don't fill their calendar. Like it just gets crazy. Um and yeah, that all happened at once for us. And we the reason the main reason we did that was for like you know obviously classification never we didn't we're very black and white. We never want to like cross that gray line or like well let's operate like this just like for the cash and then do this like you just want to sleep easy at night. But one of the things we've heard is W2 W2 W2. Um and again we're in the States so I think a little bit different potentially but interesting that you're all contractors. Yeah. It's it's so strange man. like everything that I seem to do just goes against what everyone's saying should be done. Right. Right. Down to to what we're doing now. But but there we go. But when when you're talking about that stuff in my head, I'm just thinking like, what's your goal? What's your goal? What do you want? You know, where where are you going? And it sounds like I mean, you're a better entrepreneur than me, dude. I've I've got so [ __ ] lazy now. I don't want to do all this crazy [ __ ] um and build a a massive business. I want to just keep it as simple and profitable and fun as possible. So, but you're on a different mission. I think you're just you're going for the exit, aren't you? And you know what's got to be done to get there. Yeah. And the cash flow on the way up, right? I want to make sure that we build this in a way, but complete understanding that in which is crazy to even say, but you know, at the 20s something million or whatever number, it's like it's it's break even call it with the paid ads and that it's it's crazy. And that's like, you know, you hear about Ovens when he was doing 30 million with like a million in profit and like these crazy numbers. And then you hear Iman who's done, you know, 70 million with 70% margin because organic and lean and 1099 that whole game. And it's like, yeah, we're definitely uh unconventional and maybe stupid and I will accept that fully uh with how we're like building this thing. But yeah, we have to build it for the bigger thing or there's or it's or it's too much work. It's too much too many headaches for what it produces. And that's been the case more or less for the last 6 months like getting it back on track. But with the understanding that when this thing peaks out the other side, it's like it drops a ton to the bottom line. It is clean. You know, it has this big brand. It has more backend now availabilities. We haven't even touched the other like opportunities or monetization methods, the partnerships, the, you know, the physical products, the all that. Yeah. Well, dude, don't forget to leave some meat on the bone for an acquire acquirer because that would make a great story. you know, like I'm dude, you could go to someone right now and say, "Listen, we're doing this blah blah blah. There's all this other [ __ ] to be done." You know, even if you only sold, I don't know, 30%, 50%, some something like that. I don't know what the plan is, but yeah, leave some of that stuff on the bone for the acquirer. Sure. Yeah, we're swinging for the fences and uh we'll see. We'll see, right? Cuz like right now there's so many versions of that. It's like is it just the the geo, right? Like we only sell North America right now and and for example because there's one-on-one coaching. So there's like a lot of communication calls. It's not just a course or like group coaching. So it's all North America because coaches fulfillment is all North America. So it's like there's that whole model. We have not done anything low ticket. You know the people in our space call it like a like a Vshred for example or you know some others that you know they're huge. They're a couple hundred million last I heard in in topline. You know a thousand new customers a day. I've I've heard I've heard thousands of customers a day have low ticket like they have a machine direct response guys and they just crush it. Um there's another company in the space that actually just closed down. They like kind of sold um that we initially modeled ours off of but they were you know inc top 10. They were a couple hundred million a year. Tons of supplements once they got up to scale. It was info coaching but then supplements. and they got you know basically based on their messages or their posts about this got at some level like burned out. It was this next iteration in level. They made their tens of millions you know from cash flow and they were just looking to get out sell you know digital assets and um Facebook was rising costs were rising physical product business now like this whole game. Um, so yeah, but like there's just not a lot of compare like comps to use that are direct other than like these fitness apps that have hundreds of thousands of users, which like that's not our game, right? It's not this low ticket recurring game that a lot of these guys have, which is like Yeah. So, it's just difficult for us to kind of navigate. Is it a 3x? Is it some like 10x thing? Because now we're in this game of, you know, revenue retention that's insane and we're in the thresholds of, you know, mid 8 figure or I guess low eight figure uh Ibida like I don't know. So, we'll see. Crazy, man. Yeah. I think as as you were saying that, I was thinking like what are the differences between the businesses that you can sell that you can't sell that are easier. I think this is an obvious one, but I think it's just paid ads, you know? So, if you've got that stability and control of profitable paid ads and you've got a good track record, I think it's a lot easier if you've got just organic like we do now. Like, I'd be hardfaced to sell this company. I think I' I'd like to try in the future, but this is this is a whole different ball game. I love what you said about uh bringing in you said different faces, right, to the uh to the business. Think I lost you for a second. You're back. Oh, I was just saying to you there, dude. Um you said you were bringing in different faces to the the business, right? Yeah. So, we're going to have different Yeah, we're going to have different faces. we're going to so the the acquisition side cuz for the longest time we're like we're an acquisition company and now we see it in a lot of different ways I guess now it's been a very strong uh learning curve these last probably six months but we we view the front now much more direct response and we are building it in that way so it's like how do we do this that is the most efficient way possible to generate customers that all through paid so it is currently the three funnel types and I want to get into your stuff and like how you're currently running this new model cuz I and super interesting and I and I looked into it and deep researched you and all the things but um the current model for acquisition is basically one brand face that's one that's the co-founder absolute badass like lifeblood of the company like you know the the visual representation of the company um she and we have a VSSL funnel technically two opt-in funnels we have a direct to VSSL funnel which a lot of these guys run now I call it D uh DTA direct to app headline VSSL application and then we have uh low ticket ascension funnel which the econ economics are crazy good on. So you're, you know, small, call it sub $50 thing and then instead of optimizing for AOV and having the upsell track and all that kind of stuff, instead it's optimized for uh calls. So it pushes them to book like a starter implementation call. They talk to a setter for 15 minutes, then they set with the closer. It has the highest show rates, the highest close rates, and now it's a percent game. So can you get 5% of the 100 people that buy a day to ascend into a low ticket? what's the time from lead or buyer more so to backend buyer and try and shrink that window. So like we were trying to play that game but you introduce all three of those and our CPA is like because they they're in this one and they hit this and like just the ecosystem is getting more advanced and then yeah to answer directly for your question we have that right now and we have three brand faces all in all in the ads going to brand face one's videos for the VSSL and like all this and it works it crushes. So, we don't even have the continuity yet or the congruency across of having brand phase 2 with the VSSL that's brand phase 2 and their story going to this. And that's what we just shot. That's what we have, you know, five funnels in the pipeline right now being built because we're going to have on the front end to diversify. Love it. Love it, dude. It reminds me of what uh Dave Ramsey's done with like the Ramsey personalities, you know? It's I think it's so [ __ ] smart. He's basically like taken him got other people just to reddo what he does, remake the content that he makes. It's like mini Dave Ramsey's all driving traffic back to the the main thing. I just think that's fascinating. Yeah, I think it just, you know, we it's horosy, right, is like who we consume around this that that speaks on this majority in info coaching. You have Cody Sanchez, you have, you know, um what's the other guy's name? Um I'm blanking but like the buy biz sell her whole thing about buying boring businesses but like they do all talk about online business exits and like they're the first ones to kind of own that conversation and all of them talk about acquisition issues but and sources too which I didn't really talk about is like we're very very heavy on meta and very little like we haven't full cracked Google we spend you know mid single whatever mid four figures a day there but we don't at all versus like we're spending 30 grand a day and a majority of it's on meta and then the rest is sitting over here on Google and it's, you know, all your branded stuff, all your retargeting, sure, but like we haven't cracked cold and like that's a vulnerability or like a risk point is having so much in one bucket, right? It's like, so we're just trying to figure out all the layers of that all at the same time and it's kind of a Yeah, it's a little chunky, but is it a risk or is it an opportunity? I don't know the answer to that. I don't know. So because this is I mean it's so funny like high view that bought us they just came in with their ideas you know there was not I I didn't make any suggestions to them but if there's one thing that I've learned from especially from my mentor Dan it's like it's all in the story and even the PE firm that I'm working with now to do the info roll up one of the first things that the founder said we've got to craft a good story and give them the reason why they should buy it to do this other stuff afterwards and it sounds like you've got loads of that to give to people. Oh, you can add supplements on, you can do this, you can crack this channel. So, it sounds like there's a lot of juice left to squeeze and like do you want to squeeze it and then sell or do you want to sell sooner but for maybe a bit less but I don't know, give them more opportunity so there's a stronger story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, we definitely want to hammer it. I think leading up to just because the TAM is so big, the monetization models are so big. It's like we can probably eat half of them and still leave the rest like on the bone. Uh which I think will be cool. But so yeah, let's talk about you. So now that you've done this lifestyle, so this is the Dubai uh or I'm sorry, this is the Dubai gone Bali vibe, right? So are you in both? Is it now this lifestyle? Like where you at with life? Where am I at? Well, yeah. I think dude, I'm just doing the complete opposite of what I did in the last company, you So, we used to have a massive team and I've got a tiny team. We used to have a tiny profit margin and now we've got a pretty [ __ ] high profit margin. It used to be all paid ads and t very little organic and now it's all organic and very little paid ads. So, it's just like the complete opposite of of the old business. I I just learned my lessons. I learned what I want and and and what I like, you know, and I was pretty burned out. I was burned out by the end of the company and I was especially burned out after the acquisition. So again, my plan was have no team, run no ads, start a YouTube channel, get a few consulting clients, make 30, 40, 50k a month profit, and just chill a bit more, enjoy my life a little bit more, invest the the money that that I'd kind of built up. And then when the YouTube channel blew up, dude, like it happened so [ __ ] fast, you know? I just had I had this one video which was called something like uh how to make 10K a month ASAP or or something and good god I've never seen so many sales calls get booked so fast and I quickly had to hire two reps to help me with with the volume before that happened. Right, I was taking the sales calls myself and I had my calendar set to like 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. like 10 days out and I was getting no calls. I was booking one or two or three calls a week, you know, from from from the YouTube. And then when that video blew up, man, [ __ ] hell. Like, yeah, it it was wild. And then I just capitalized on it basically. And uh the business grew really fast and we only had one offer back then. I was just charging £5,000 a month for one call a week, uh basically. And I had a few people in that. And then when the YouTube channel blew up, we got loads of people on calls that either couldn't afford that or weren't right for it. So, we made a group uh program to go alongside it. Then we got someone on a call one day that said, "Listen, could you please do it for for me and I don't care what the price is." Then we made a done for you program to satisfy that guy. It's our bestselling program now. And it just kind of slowly grew up to where we are today. So now we're doing about depending on the month about 450 to 600 cash. Uh team of seven. The margin last month was 83.1%. So it's just like a a profitable fun little little machine now, you know? That's Yeah, that's fun. That's fun. How are you doing so much done for you with such a light team? Dude, I it's it's it's really simple. So like if you came in today, this is this is what would happen. If you came in today, I would say, right, go through the training program first. Take four, five, six, seven days. Go right through the program. That's going to put my brain in your head. and then booking your first call with me and here's my calendar. Right? So people go into the program, five, six, seven, eight days later they book a call. I get on a one-to-one with them. And we call it a blueprint call. I just help them design their offer, the price, the funnel, just everything. And then they go to my copywriter and I'm like, "Right, book in with with W and get on with your ads and VSSL or what whatever it is." W disappears for 7 to 10 to 14 days, comes back with a VSSL, a set of ads, the copy that they need. Then I show them how to produce everything. So it's back to me. They produce, let's say, the VSSL and the ads. Uh we've got a go high level white label. So they sign up to the white label which has already got the funnel and emails and everything in there. Yeah. We connect it all up for them. They get on a call with my media buyer who will set everything up, the tracking, get everything turned on, and that's it. So it's just me, my copywriter, and and my media buyer. It's super simple. That's amazing. That's literally amazing. Yeah, it's easy. And then yeah, you you know keep your 30 40% of that that would go to ads because it's all organic now, right? It's all organic. Yeah, that's amazing. And then just like a lean sales team because you're doing Is there anything direct to cart? Well, direct to Well, we've got our bookfunnel, right, which is where we spend some money on. We're spending about 12k a month on ads right now. So, not a lot. And that's the only ad spend we run. So they can buy the book and then they're pushed to a VSSL to book a call. But if for every hundred calls that we book, 70 will come from YouTube, 20 will come from Instagram, 10 will come from LinkedIn/tobookfunnel basically. So it's like heavily weighted to YouTube. Yeah. How's the bookunnel going? Well, the book math on it or just feedback or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So it's very profitable. So we're about 4x 5 1/2x territory, but the sales cycle is long as [ __ ] you know, like we So the front end is about 0.32 right now. So we'll spend a,000, lose 700 nod, and we only do two three sales a month, but because our prices are so high, that two, three sales immediately puts us in 4x, 5x, 6x uh cash territory. So, it's very profitable, but not fast and not particularly great. We're about to start spending a bit more. I'm just making a new batch of ads and we're going to push on the gas a bit. We've just finally got a setter now to start. This is so stupid. I know how stupid this is, but we didn't even have anyone dialing the [ __ ] leads for months because we were just so profitable that we didn't [ __ ] care, you know? But now we're starting to take things more seriously. Yeah. No, that's amazing. um the the book funnels the consumption around that is just so I talk about that a lot on here like the the difference in those funnel types the frictions like you know as a function of consumption right you have a DTA funnel where it's like someone can apply in 2 seconds your show rates are like this the close rates like this because they don't have as much context versus an opt-in person that is forced to watch VSSL or consume emails resources before they get to the application and like just trying to do that but the book funnel is a very interesting one to me cuz you know the physical book on a shelf it sits on someone's coffee table, they read it and they actually consume that thing and they spend however many hours, you know, reading in your voice and in your story in your, you know, really like selling themselves and consuming. Um, so for us and maybe this will for you guys, but if you lose like let me do some math here, but you know, if you're losing I don't want to give you know our exact numbers. That's the one thing I don't talk about. I don't talk about our exact cost structure necessarily. I talk about like every number in the world. I'm just not on like daily spend. We're kind of you know 30 right now. it was 18 x amount of days ago. Like it all changes. But like if you're losing 50 bucks a unit and that ascension rate is like five. So between your setter, between your, you know, CTAs in the book, between if you give them a a master, like there's this whole game around that, you know, that's $1,000 CPA on the back, right? 5% ascend. And then it's what time frame does that take? So that's the game we're playing a little bit with this is like how do you crack cold where you can sell a hundred of those books a day and go in the hole you know pretty extensively for sure but you know the time to lead and for us what I heard we right now will just do that like I said book a call with a setter and then book a call with a closer so the time frame is really like the average of close is like 5 days which is amazing instead of having this huge drawn out one um and that's again the average of the closes not the average if you include everyone and like blend it out um or thus far. But we then drop them into cuz it's a low ticket course. So you have like all the content they're consuming, you're constantly pushing them back into the education, the community aspect as well. And then you have we have very light on the setters honestly too. Like we leave some on the table there, but there's CTAs all in there. And then there's emails that all go back to there that's pushing them to either book that call or apply direct with a closer, which is like, you know, the two different ones. Um, but yeah, you get that thing up to 5% and you're in like honeypot territory of Yeah, that's that's the goal, mate. Yeah, we're we're really going all in on the book funnel now and kind of taking things a bit more serious. So, I' I've had my fun for the last year and a half and now I want to get get my hands dirty again, you know. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, that's Dude, those numbers are amazing. Amazing. Yeah, they [ __ ] are. Yeah, they [ __ ] are. Yeah. 83% margin like you know anything over like 50 to me is just like so a like I just haven't really seen it at scale with paid ads unless it's you know years of cooked and backend and all that where you have 95% you know gross margin cuz however the fulfillment model is you don't have the ads you don't have the spend you know all the stuff on the back to where it can offset it but if you're scaling into front end heavily it's like you're constantly playing this game of it's like driving down over here for this future number and that's that whole game of like you know operating to sell or operating for future everything just in life. It's like if you're doing stuff now for this future thing instead of like for today, you're just constantly paying that price in dollars and time and whatever. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Exactly. If there's one thing that I've learned, it's like whatever you focus on, the other things will be be rocky, but you'll get what you want from focus. So, there was a time in the last business where honestly we were just like, how much revenue can we can we do? And that to me now is really [ __ ] stupid. And I can't believe I thought that way. But I remember saying to my sales team manager, how how big can we grow and we'll we'll sacrifice profit to see? And we did and we grew massive rev and smashed the the profit margin, you know, and then in this business now the focus is let's keep like, dude, my number one focus is just the profit margin. Every goddamn month, I'm thinking, what can we do? What can we change to keep the profit margin as high as possible? So, I've got what I want, a lot of profit, but at the cost of revenue, at the cost of scale, at the cost of reaching more people, having a bigger business, you know, so you get what you want, but you'll lose the other things that when you take your eye off the ball. That makes sense. Yeah. No, 100%. And the other thing I hear, and this is where I'm interested to see, like the what's your lifestyle like right now? Because the other thing a lot of people a lot of people are willing to sacrifice in terms of lifestyle for margins like that but it doesn't seem like you have that issue as much. Yeah. Well, so I still do one-to-one consulting, right? And it's it's very unscalable. So we we've got the three main programs. The group program which is easy because it's two hours a week for one call. the one-to-one program uh where people get anytime one-to-one and a WhatsApp chat with me and the done for you program and the most intense for me is the one-to-one. So, we've worked out that people book about three calls with me a month for for 45 minutes per per person. And I usually do three full call days per week, which will be like 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. with a gap in the afternoon. So, it's just like call call. Thankfully, I really enjoy it, you know, and if the day comes where I don't enjoy it, I'll just turn it off and maybe keep the group and keep the done for you or something like that. So, for now, I really really enjoy it just like this. It's just like chatting to people and and helping them. It's it's easy. It's so easy and fun. And the lifestyle is pretty pretty empty. It's it's nice. I just usually do the three cold days, four days off, and I just make YouTube videos, read, chat to the team, go play tennis, go to the gym, you know, and and just kind of chill. And it's like what I wanted really is is what I've got right now. But I'm starting to get bored. I'm starting to think like, ah, I want to I want to I want to scale again, you know? I want to I want to grow this thing bigger, which is why we're focusing on the book funnel now. So yeah, it's just seasons, you know? I had my season of [ __ ] stress. Now I've had my season of peace. Now I'm up for a bit more stress again. So yeah, back to the chaos a little bit. Back to the chaos. Yeah. Yeah. So you're doing So you are like full in Bali or you're going to bounce. What's What's the plan there? Did you say? Yeah. Well, one of my dreams was to have like a global infrastructure. I wanted to have like a forever home in Bali, a forever home in Dubai, forever home in England so I could see my parents. And I've got the one in uh Bali. I'm about to buy the one in in Dubai and the plan is really six months, six months. So, six months Bali, six months Dubai. And I was thinking, you know, six months of peace and chilling and then six months of Dubai stress in in the desert. So, we we'll see. That's that's the plan. Yeah. Cool. And yeah, that's so fun. We uh super random tangent, but the uh I went to Changenu or and uh was there for I went to for like a developer course which is hilarious now looking back but like that had to have been almost 10 years or you know 8 years ago and went out there stayed right on like you know Echo Beach right on that line and did a developer course there for 2 months I had never been went alone and stayed in some like hostile thing cuz I had zero money and basically like just went to this class and did that and then fast forward x amount of years later I started working with this company and I'm technically like co-owner not co-founder. So, I was like number four or five on the team and then became, you know, co uh co-owner through this process um of of scaling it and growing. And they I worked with them for probably three or four months and they were living out there for 3 or 4 months and they were like, "Yeah, come on out." And the f I literally got on a plane and the first time I met the team and the you know, other owners and partners of this business was meeting them in person and staying in a villa there with them for like a month and some change and that was right before COVID hit. Like I flew out of there because world was in mania mode and no one knew it was going to happen and I left after that. So I was there for like a month in a villa probably down the street with those guys and just building in person. Dude, Bali is the best man. Bali just got like a fun chilled vibe. You know, Dubai for me was too heavy. Like Dubai was just too too heavy, too tense. I would like not leave the apartment or not leave like, you know, the building area with a cafe downstairs and [ __ ] and it was just too heavy, too tense. I needed to snap out, you know, and Barley's just been being great for that. But it's a matter of time until I want that energy back and I'm back over there going hard again. But for now, I'm good. Yeah. So, like network-wise, I mean, you have to have an insane access to network. I feel like you're, you know, you're one of the ones on a handful, right, that I think about in this game and space. Everything you're doing with organic and like, you know, you come out as a leader, a, you know, one of the thought thought people of this area that I think really stand out. Um, so like, do you have access to all the all the network and talent? Like when you go and travel places, you guys, are you one of those guys who likes to like set up the dinners and do all the stuff and meet everyone or are you more of like the chill, move in silence? I don't know. A a bit of both. A bit of both to be honest. I mean, I've I've been lucky because I met so many people in Becca's mastermind. I met so many people in S. Which one? Which one did he have? He he had a mastermind called Iron. Yeah, that's I was in that. Oh, you were in that as well. Yeah. So, I bought uh that's how that's how we learned how to do the YouTube ads and that's the initial uh VSSL template that we used that we did like probably 15 20 million through was that I think the short form one you had on there. And then he had the long form, short form, uh, direct to call one. Yeah, dude. That [ __ ] iron, iron changed my life, man. It's made me so much goddamn money. But yeah, I met so many people through that. I met so many people through Sam Oven's mastermind, so many people through Cole Gordon's mastermind. And when I was in Dubai, I think people must have like seen my YouTube. And then when they come to Dubai, they would just message me all all the bloody time. I was doing dinners all the [ __ ] time with uh with people as they they came through. So I lost you for a second. But yes, they're coming to Dubai and you can see Yeah, there you go. back. Um yeah, no, that that's hilarious you say that though. Bloody Bali internet, man. I need to sort this [ __ ] internet out. They promised me that it would be that it would be good speed, but never mind. Never mind. But uh never mind that. But that's crazy you say that about iron. That's uh you know those are OG days. That thing was what 5 10 grand like sub and it was a onetime thing and it was hitters in there. Yeah, dude. I I think I paid six grand. It was like six or sevenk like disgustingly cheap. But yeah, be being in Dubai really really helped with with network, you know, because I'd go to a party with a friend, meet, you know, two, three other people that I that I, you know, know there, go for dinner with one of them, and then meet four other people, go to this person's apartment, and there's other people at that apartment, you know, and all of a sudden all the big guys, you end up with them a party or a dinner or a mastermind or something like that. So Dubai was amazing for for the network and it got me a lot of clients as well. Like being in Dubai and the YouTube got me some really like highle clients that I don't think I would have had if I wasn't in in Dubai in person, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did the Puerto Rico thing for the last x amount of years, which is like the US version of that where like the tax zone of that, right? So super isolating for me. I'm not somebody who leaves the desk very often. So like exactly what you're saying like go downstairs to the grocery or the gym that's in the base of the building and like that's it back to the desk and I think there's a much bigger opportunity very similar pocket of people right from us but I just didn't really do it and I ended up leaving cuz I was like I just don't have you know friends and stuff down here and I want to kind of try and continue on on life and not just focus on the money in that way you know at that level cuz you're really only there for that like a lot of people. Um beautiful weather, beautiful whatever but you can get that in a lot of other places. Um but that's interesting you say that. So for meeting people out there for meeting you know people you work with or that have become clients in some capacity what do you view as like where's the line on how you how far you want to take the business model and like these clients so and and where I'm going with this and the example is I talked to Iman right I bought Iman's course thing for their mastermind it's like 20 G's or whatever it was really what it was is kicking the ass to just make videos and now every day I've just made videos and it's worked we hit the goal that he and I talked about but in the beginning it was that exact same model. It was like build this thing up, build your core company, basically build a network, monetize it through a couple one-on- ones if you want to where you can make a couple million bucks a year having one-on-one clients. But he gave this example of this guy he knew that makes tens of millions a year in like, you know, basically cash from these things where he does coaching style, but the monetization model is percentage and ownership. So instead of you know paying you 25 grand or 50 grand for your done for you or your coaching situation you get ownership in them and you coach through either onetoone or group coaching but your your your your payment model is that. So what do you think about that? What do you think about changing the monetization model to where you have you know I don't know exactly who you're who that is but for you Yeah. Yeah. It's funny, man, like you well, number one, you a couple of people that you've interviewed have have been my clients in in the past. Really awesome to see those guys on here as well. And someone said, I can't remember who said this, but someone that you interviewed said, would you rather do like two and a half mil a month with a 20% margin or like 6 7 800k a month with like an 80% margin? And he was like, I'd rather have the 2 and a half mil, right? A 20% margin. I was like, "Fuck that [ __ ] I'd rather have 600 a month with a [ __ ] 90% margin," you know, and and I've heard Iman say that in the the past. So, for sure I for me like I want to keep it not as small as possible. I I want it to be as big as it can be, but I wouldn't scale and sacrifice profit where as I did do that in my last company and I wouldn't do that again. But with a caveat though, I don't want to exit this business though. If I did want to exit this business, whole different story. I'd be bringing in licensed coaches, bringing in CSM, stopping the onetoone, running paid ads, you know. So, the fact that I don't want to sell, and the fact that I just focus on profit, it's it's a great model. As long as you're willing to do the the onetoone coaching, which I am, this is a [ __ ] great model because you can charge way more. And we charge high ticket recurring as well, which we we can talk about. Um, but with that said, if the day comes that I stop enjoying the onetoone, I would either go group or I would go the Hermosi model and and come in and take equity and just get three or four or five massive clients and go all in. And I I'll probably do that next when that day comes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, obviously I I agree with you like with what we're building, if I was to build another one, it would be this huge backend model. It would be all that kind of stuff, but it would really also be what you're saying like these really high margin and kind of more lean and focused just cuz I've seen how this one plays out and how much you know how many headaches there can be and the people things and all the things. But I do wonder if you even in current state could do something that you kept the fulfillment model but you just changed the monetization model. So instead of right instead of having just this like high ticket recurring which is obviously amazing and is you know directly contributes to what you just said is your goal. Uh but the other side of it is if you can get that percent. It was just so interesting to me to hear that someone was making multiple eight figures a year in basically distributions because and and the and the fulfillment model is the same as yours. It's, you know, I to my understanding it was actually a couple group coaching calls and then the people who'd show up are the founders or partners and they would be in group setting which is even crazier uh than onetoone but like imagine that right you have six group coach calls or whatever five a week it's one a day people just pop on and the founders or the partners just ask questions you own 10 or 40 or whatever percent of the company you deploy some of your light team but you know same lifestyle and fulfillment model but because you get percentage or upside or and who knows right if anything ever sells in that world or who knows if that's but just an interesting idea. Yeah, I I appreciate you planting that in my head because you you're completely right. I think can it be done? Well, clearly yes. To what degree acquisition would be interesting, but I'm definitely open. I mean, dude, right now I'm just in [ __ ] around and find out mode. Yeah, basically. So, I'll I'll probably try that. I'll probably try that. Um, but for now it's pretty well balanced, dude. Something that really actually doubled our business, right? One of my closers said to me last December because basically it's just it was just pay monthly. And one of my closers said, "Will, what do you think would happen if we let people buy multiple months on day one and we gave them like free months, so like buy two get one free or buy three get two free, that kind of thing." And we tried it and doubled the business, like pretty much doubled the business like overnight. It was [ __ ] amazing. That was crazy. Yeah. Yeah. We just went to uh Onyx and Gaul's event and and he's very obvious, you know, he's the transparent guy around this stuff. He's like just know, you know, we will, you know, sell you on this. We are going to attempt to sell you on the mastermind on the back end of this. And uh for him, he was like a lot of these guys and two two for example, you join and it's I forget his numbers right now. So this is, you know, not doxing or anything because I actually don't remember. It's five grand, it's 20 grand, it's whatever number is basically like your startup. And then starting month two or three, it becomes the monthly thing and then they live within there. I know that's the same thing that uh Ezra Firestone when we initially joined that for his blue ribbon mastermind. It's whatever chunk up front and then this like mid to high ticket, call it anywhere from 1,500 to 3 or 4,000 a month that just sits there then on the books and then you have your fulfillment. It's your group coaching. you can get access to all the courses uh and then you know once or twice a year events was a was a lot of how those a lot of those guys model it like that. Yeah. I you you know who Taylor Welches, right? Yeah. Yeah. I I really Yeah, I know. Taylor I really liked his model of uh I think it was something like 35 to get in and two a month to stay in. I thought that was a really good model, man. It's not not quite right for what we do. But I think that was a great model because you don't want to leave, you know, when when you've paid that down. So it's so sticky, you know, so sticky. So yeah, I mean I almost said his name earlier because I've built some of some tech stack stuff with him and you know back when I was just doing a lot of marketing tech and he's a very interesting dude but he has a similarish story of you know he's got his loss he posted at one point of where everything was worth like 90 million and you know trying to do that with the traffic and funnel sides and then exact same thing he was like I want to optimize for I love this model I love this industry these people this whole thing but I want to optimize it for cash you know for margin for cash flow and do it through organic and do it through multiple couple of these and he crushes. Yeah, it's so funny, man, because again, I think I've heard him man say this and I'm I'm I really I really love it, man. I love his take on this stuff, but we do all this [ __ ] to make money, to make net income, to build wealth and get freedom. And we do so much stupid [ __ ] that erodess the net profit and erode and we have big complex annoying businesses. And I think everyone has the day always comes where people look at what they're doing and be like, "What am I doing, man?" You know, there's a simpler, better [ __ ] way. Yeah. No, 100% is. There we go. We got the coffee. We're on brand now. I watched like five of your videos last night just to make sure that I was just to make sure I was on I was on pace. Um, all right. So, what's your what's your like favorite niche or clients? You don't have to, you know, dox names or anything, but because I'm sure you have multiple niches, same I or explain that. So, like all your clients are mainly doing the same business model or like how they do acquisition or whatever, but is it all different niches? Is it Oh, god. dude, the niches are so varied. I we've worked in Bible studies, fitness, golf, ecom, god, basketball, communication, uh hiring, systems building, uh uh dating, uh god, bloody loads, man. Loads of niches, you know. It's uh that's one thing that keeps it fun is it's it's the same model, right? typically just get traffic, put it in a sales process, convert it, provide value, charge high prices so you're nice and profitable. Essentially, it's always the same thing, but the niches and the people uh really keep it interesting. So, loads of niches, man. Loads of different niches. Yeah. Interesting. And then you're so the education or the coaching piece is all kind of is it's specific to the business model you're running right now. So it's how to build what you're currently doing basically. Essentially. Essentially. Yeah. I mean the company is called uh buildgrow andexit.com. And that's exactly what we do. We either help people to build these businesses or grow these businesses or exit these businesses. So it's a pretty [ __ ] appropriate name, you know, for uh for for what we do. It's it's mostly people surprisingly it's mostly people that want to build. It's I I would say it's 60 60% people building for the first time maybe you know the rest is pretty much grow and four people have bought the the exit program. It's very [ __ ] expensive and you know there's not many people that are right for it but uh but yeah that's kind of what it looks like. Yeah, that one that would even be interesting if just your exit model one monetization was instead of uh you know 50 grand or 100 grand whatever number it was percentage that could be interesting if you have you know the XYZ confidence in the business or the XYZ confidence in your team and what they can do to the business like being able to get a chunk of that exit. Yeah, that's probably what I'll do next. I think when when the day comes, I'll probably just actually go in, take equity with a view to exiting and work with way less people. It's a whole different ball game because then you're like, you're getting married to someone for one, two, three bloody years. So, it's such a different play, you know, and honestly, yeah, I'm like, is it worth two to three years of my life to make X when I can do three, four, 500 a month now and it's not that hard, you know? So, I always come back to this. Yeah. It's just it's just I think I've got golden handcuffs right now, you know? It's just so good. Yeah. But maybe it's stopping me going bigger, which is something that's on my mind right now, to be honest. Yeah. Well, it's the trade-off, right? Like you said, I mean, you want a little chaos like you, you know, openly say you want a little bit of you want to enter your stressful era again because you know it's stress. It's just a different lifestyle. Yeah, it is. It's It is fun though when you're getting your hands dirty and there's all the stuff going on and you know it it is very fun. It's I just love these businesses, man. They're like really fun puzzles to figure out and when you figure them out you make loads of money. It's like the best game in the world. Yeah, 100%. What is uh what do you view as the most difficult part or like the most stressful part of that scale? Right. Like if you if you were saying right now, you know, you want to 3X, like what do you see the hierarchy of bottlenecks that occur for you or become the most stressful or painful? Team and paid ads. It's just literally the two things in that last business that led me to hate the business by by the end of it was just the team. And we weren't spending that much. We were spending at our height 6k a day on on ads, but even that to me was was quite stressful, you know, because the more we spend, the less profitable we were, the more headaches, the more you're desperate for your sales team to [ __ ] perform. And the more desperate you are, the harder it is, you know. Again, I'm giving myself [ __ ] PTSD even thinking back to this. But yeah, all you're doing is talking about my everyday right now. So, yeah. Yeah, it's I I would say the team because to I love writing ads. I love writing VSSLs. I love building funnels. I love doing the coaching. I absolutely love the content. Like making videos is probably my number one favorite thing in in the world. I just love it. So, it's just the team. I think having a big team and hiring and firing and managing and ramping and that is the thing that I don't like. I would say, yeah, people ask me questions in like this request box thing and I'll make videos about them and I obviously need some help on that because I have to come up with something every day. But one of the big questions that is is is around that. It's how to find talent. It's managing people. It's whatever, which isn't really an issue until you get to whatever size, you know, call it double digits uh on team. But I made this video that was like this whole walkthrough of like how we find talent for certain things and like where we put them and like the communication channels and the pods and all this. And the very first line item was just like life hack, skip all of this and just hire like a chief of people. And ours was like an organic thing that occurred for us. But we had a coach that then became basically the director of coaches that then became like director of people. Just super high EQ, complete culture fit, a leader in her own right, like all all the things you can imagine. And she is like that everything for us in that in that role. Um, so she's like a ride or die, been here for years now. And yeah, that was a huge life hack for us. Not necessarily on like the management side and structure and ops and whatever. that's more me and in my realm of the project list and the KPI boards and the meeting structure and all that but for finding them for the hard conversations for um comp stuff for like anything in that world and then also just the cultural like glue of it she crushes for us and I you know it's a very hard thing to just say oh go hire one you know go hire a chief of people because it's not your HR admin it's not your normal HR director it's not your whatever like there's a lot of things to it but that was such a life hack for us such a life hack Yeah, I I mean the truth is I need to if I decide to grow this company, I just need to to get better at it, you know, and I need to learn how to kind of put it together properly and get a chief of staff and get put kind of proper things in place. Um I'm a bit embarrassed to to admit this, dude, but like up until a few months ago, we didn't even track anything and we didn't do team meetings either. We we've done about three meetings in honestly I I swear to God 11 months, 12 months, 13 months and I was just like feeding the team calls and just being like do your best to close them, you know, and because they were warm and because they were organic and high trust, they closed them very well obviously and they were talented reps as well because I was lucky to have really good reps to hire. But this has been a bit of period bit of a period of like are we going to sort our [ __ ] out now or not? It's like, yes, we should if if we want to grow, you know. Yeah. Well, you'd rather be sorting it out when you're doing 80% margin, right, than when you're doing 20 and then and then try to do it, right? And try to add stacks. So, that's amazing, though. I mean, I I think your business model is so cool. I think it's uh I think it's it's probably a good fit for mo for most people that come with experience is kind of like the caveat there. not these guys that are just trying to start from nothing to who are selling coaches to co you know coaching to coaches who coach like that whole game or like but if you are someone who has tenure in this space or you have tenure in other spaces I always talk about how that's such a life hack if you're an expert in whatever niche that's outside of internet marketing and can layer in all the internet marketing principles and structure both on fulfillment acquisition just like the consulting model true and true you can crush like ours is in fitness right not in internet marketing world but like there's 92 of them. Like I know the one that does like landscape and snow and does a version of this and crushes. I know somebody who does it in like uh what's the uh knitting like there are ones that crush. Yeah. And just use and use the principles. Dude, 100% man. And in fact, I want to ask you another question. So when you exit, cuz I've got no [ __ ] doubt that that you're going to exit, but when you exit, what are you going to do next? Me? Yeah. Oh man. Um I don't know, man. I got I have a million in one itches that I try and for a long time it it got in my way, right? So, it was like I've bought every course. I've paid every guru. I've looked at every business model. I have a pulse on like everything, right? And like by doing that, I am not the best at anything. And I have never rescaled the agency, but I've bought all the how to build agency courses. I've done all the drop ship or ecom whatever courses and you know messed around done 100 grand in a month and turned it off the next month because you know back to the main thing back to the main thing. Um but I have now allowed myself I just call it interest mapping. I allow myself to do it to where I can like scratch the itch and I can go play in this game knowing that as long as the skill set overlaps with the current main co I allow myself to do it as like a fun side quest. So, example of this, I moved back here was like, "Oh, I'm going to have this taxation, you know, problem more or less now because I didn't have it. Now I do." Uh, cuz I just moved out of PR and uh I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into real estate and start doing all this." And I start getting into these like pockets and like, "Oh, it's interesting to me." And I'm like, "The overlap is just not there enough in current state to justify that for me, right?" Right? Like there's there's other models. There's other ways to do it to achieve the result if it's taxation call it versus me spending I know me and I'm going to crack out and go complete in-depth into something and like I shouldn't be spending the time on that necessarily cuz they just the the skill doesn't overlap. So all to say yes this exits where what's the next model? What's the next scale of things? Um, I see this as multiple years from now. But I see on the way up the time commitment coming down a bit as we get like the machine in place to make it so it could sell. So the team's in place and it's fulfilled on and like it doesn't require 80 hours a week of us or whatever. Um, so dream state is getting it to a place where it's 10 20 you know maybe 10 of actual meetings and then the rest is just thinking about it higher level stuff. we have the network from this and from, you know, the business being big enough that we can hire entrepreneur style talent for like full new divisions if we want to have some big, you know, supplements, let's call it, for example. Um, but yeah, if we get this thing up to those numbers and do exit this, I'm not sure. I don't have a ton of hobbies. I don't have a ton of external stuff. I work too much and not as effective as I could. You know, I'll sit at this desk for 16 hours and could probably do the work in eight. And like I just haven't mastered, like you said earlier, the skill set of being able to do that. I've never built a personal team. No EAS, no nothing. So like I just kind of stack it all on top of each other. I've got the personal YouTube and X stuff. I've got this business. I've got other things. I have, you know, a personal life that's this big right now because of that. And it's just a skill I haven't mastered. So I don't really know what to say the next is, uh, other than just bigger and bigger plays because like my identity is this right now. And maybe that completely sheds and I have to refind that out. But right now it's all work all the time. Uh, dude, I I hear that. I was the same. I am. I am the same. Do Do you want to be a billionaire? Yeah. Arbitrarily. We were talking about this last week, actually. I was like, arbitrarily like, yeah, I I don't view it necessarily. I mean, yes, it's a scoreboard. And I am this big again compared to even my friends, compared to the space. And I feel so weird when I'm like, oh, like you kind of have to do it at some level. It's like, we did 75 million. Like, total cash collected ever. We did 30 last year. Okay, cool. you're in this bracket of businesses, but like I don't know, we have we all know and have the friends that do much much larger numbers. Um, and I like to try and be like, you know, ego and humble around that and much higher profit margins, too. Those are vanity metrics that, you know, the top top is cash collected or revenue technically, right? But like, um, so it's a scoreboard for me, but the big thing is the progression. Like I just said, the skill set like I've identified now the layers of the skill set that I the ones that are right here that I know I can't do. The ones that are out here that I don't even know exist that I don't have. And then like you know the ones I have and I've grown into. Um so it's progression. It's progression in physical fitness. It's progression in life in in my lifestyle. It's progression in bank account. it's progression of the business and what you know I know how to call it make millions and operate in or like you know do this but I don't know how to lead a team of people that make millions and operate in their thing or you know stuff like that thinking like that is kind of where I'm at cuz if I can do that it's just the skill stacking so if that gets to the place where the skills have stacked to the level that I can then be the person that is you know worth a billion dollars or does this for sure but knowing that it is me that I have to progress and work on to even get close to where that direction is. Um, and then yeah, the numbers just arbitrary. It's like where where's the actual number of where you're living that couple hundred million you hear on whoever whatever podcast and stuff. I don't know. I have no personal experience. Yeah. Do do you have like um a number like like a number where if you got to it, you would feel good about stopping kind of thing. I I don't know whether I've described that very well. uh in light in life versus of selling the business in terms of like like wealth like actual liquidity and investments where you're kind of like your set for life number. No, your [ __ ] you number. No, I mean yeah I only know again I only know what I've made my you know my millions. I've spent like an idiot. I have I was, you know, ripping life, let's just say, in, you know, maybe not the most positive way for x amount of time and learned my lessons there and now have a different approach and like what I do with it and where I sit on it and like I hit it hard and did that in my own right. Um, with that being said, I don't, you know, I listen to the My First Million podcast. I listen to like different things in that scope and those are the guys who kind of talk about that, right? The exits, they they talk about the what the true lifestyle or the freedom number is. um to fully live like the most exorbitant exorbitant lifestyle possible. I hear it's like low couple hundreds to be like full-blown to be like to be like jet money and like do all that kind of stuff is like hundreds right um to live very very nice lifestyle is you know I think the Andrew Wilkinson book on uh I love that book by the way or and him he has that similar model of the holding co um but his was he has an equation I think in there but it's like high tens basically very high tens coolurren state, which I'm like, "Okay, it's interesting." Have you ever listened to that um Hampton podcast? Yeah. Yeah. I love that. I watch like every episode. I just I'm fascinated by like investment and wealth and kind of like infrastructure. It's probably the thing that I think the most about is like having a sick kind of bed of wealth, you know? I love that podcast. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I I wish they did it in the style that was my first million cuz I love that podcast and I feel like the style and how they do like the like blurbs in and then like do these little tangents and go off like I don't love the style of it just like random thing but um I think the guests that are on there I think Hampton's a really cool model too um you know it's the it's the next layer of community I I think they're rolling out in person now I heard so good man so good yeah love that it's like a it's a mastermind isn't it for for high net worth individuals Yeah, exactly. And it's I think it's sub 10k a year. My dad's in uh Vistage and has been which is like the really massive version of that. It's like a global one. Um so I've been introduced to Vistage meetings and they basically have a speaker that comes and then it's like half the day is a speaker and then half the day is like your small group and it's in person. So they have cohorts and it's like every six weeks they do this cadence and he's been in it for 20 something years I think. um he does landscaping snow removal but it's uh you know he built a big cultured driven people driven organization and uh it's Hampton's that just on you know online business founder startup that whole game within X bracket so I think it's I think they're cool systems I've never been in anything like that though other than you know the online info people masterminds yeah me me too I've never been in that I've only been to a couple of inerson masterminds I'm always the virtual guy who doesn't want to travel too lazy Yeah, same. Same. Do you have any goals of that being the Cuz right now I don't know who would categorize as like the person. I guess it's probably Iman. Like Iman's having his event in London. We're going to go to that. Like that's kind of it or kind but that's a little more broad. It's more people. Um Welch used to have them that were like the main ones. I guess Kohl's for a while. I think you said you went to Kohl's but his was like the one you go to if you're killing it in info coaching. Yeah. What do you know who um who David Dre is? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was the one who was at uh consulting.com, right? Yeah. He was like Sam Oven's I think is Sam Oven's head of sales back back in the day. So, I partnered with David to do our mastermind. It's called the Dubai Boardroom. So, we do it every six months, 45 people uh in in Dubai for three days. We've done five of them now. Um so, that's that's been really fun to uh to do. And I do the Bali ones as well. Now, the next one is actually next Saturday. It's it's only eight people here at at the the villa, but that's that's very fun. So, I just make people come to me so I I don't have to go to them. It's way better. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. I didn't even know that exists. I now that you say that, I feel like I've seen him make posts or whatever of you guys in like a little old boardroom or something. So, who's in the room for those? It's so broad, man. We have people that are doing 10, 20, 30k a month. People that are doing 300, 500, a million, million, and a half a month. Um we've and we've slowly got bigger every time. We did 10 people, then we 15, then 25, then 30, now 45. We're going to go a bit bigger for the next one next uh next year. So, it's a it's a bit of a mix. It's a bit of a mix. Just taken from me and David's network basically. We just plug it organically and and sell the tickets. Yeah. Yeah. And then what's the format? Is it like the people in the room are up giving their spiel or is it just like round table or It's Yeah, it's not the whole like presentations and stuff like that. It's literally it's pretty much the same as Sam Wven's old mastermind. So day one I get in the room, we go around every person and I ask everyone, "What's your business? How much are you doing a month? What is um the main problem or bottleneck? And what's one thing that's working well for you?" I write it down for every person. And then we basically pick a pick a problem or a bottleneck and get solving it together basically across the weekend. So it's like collaborative which is it's way more fun. It's way better that way man. I don't like the big like presentation stuff. It's just not as not as fun in my opinion. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, we for the longest time like never even went to conferences. And again, I didn't we we almost we looked at Kohl's for a little bit cuz we bought Kohl's uh like middle tier program when we were trying to figure out sales management and trying to figure out the reps. Um but we never went to that event. Um but any event we go to is like a conference where we don't go to any of the actual conference at all and then we end up just hanging out with people outside that are there for the same thing and like do that. But I'm I'm interested to see how Eman's is cuz we're going to that in whatever two weeks in London. Um and I've heard same thing of theirs is like it's very light on terms of presentations and it's just round table hangout. This one's all hosted at one place where like everyone's staying on site. So that's going to be interesting because that's you know 24/7 for 243 I guess you know three days of it but 24 hours a day is around everyone which will be interesting. Yeah that's that's so good man. I think that's going to be really fun. Really fun. that those are the ones I prefer. Just like it's kind of really networking and helping each other, you know, rather than like teaching. It's a better vibe. Yeah. No, no, 100%. Well, cool. I mean, we're running up on an hour 23. You have any other fun, any crazy scale, any crazy story, anything you want to cover? Crazy scale and crazy stories. Well, I can tell. That's I mean generally these are literally just the most ad hoc Oh well I'm sorry. Yeah I would say most of these are just the most ad hoc conversations that are you know getting to know the person random combo. I don't want to be all interviewy or podcasty you know I mean at some level obviously this is just naturally a podcast but um yeah I don't know just like what's working now in the business what are the cool big things? What are the random stories? What are like the in the weeds things that you see? Just you know the fun. Yeah, I mean, dude, for me, YouTube is is is the key driver, you know? I mean, I could talk about some more technical uh tactical bits and bobs, you know, to to book more calls that we do on places like Instagram, but YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Well, for sure. We'll do one thing that got us way way way more calls, and this is people probably know this already, but just in case they don't. So, we just started sending a a selfie video of me to every single follower on on Instagram and then chatting to them, qualifying them, setting them. That got us an extra 70 80 calls a month. So, figuring that out, I actually got um a message from a setter and he basically said to me, "Will I work for Charlie Morgan right now? Charlie is about to fire his setting team. So, I'm looking for a role. if you like, I can just bring in all his systems, all his processes, put it in your business. I had a call with the guy and I was like, "Yeah, let's do it." Came in 80 extra calls a month like immediately. So, that was amazing to to kind of discover that because we weren't doing anything on Instagram. And otherwise, dude, YouTube wise, uh we we've had a bit of a breakthrough recently, right? So, if we go back about a month ago and back, my YouTube videos used to have like a big description. My book was in there, the mastermind was in there, my website was in there, my [ __ ] story was in there, the VSSL link was in there and uh it just got a bit bloated and we were doing well. We were booking a lot of calls. But recently, we deleted everything and just put a link to the VSSL right at the [ __ ] top on its own. And dude, we've taken calls up by I got to look at this live, you know? So that little tactical tweak has taken us from about nine calls a day, 10 calls a day area to like 14, 15, 16 calls. Wow. area that that one change. So that was it's one of those simple things where it's so obvious, but we just hadn't done it. We hadn't tested it and immediately we changed it and straight away we we had way more calls. So that's that's been very impactful. So, those are a couple of like tactical little little bits and bobs. The Instagram selfie video thing and the YouTube description simplicity thing that's been a a game changer. So, yeah. Yeah, I'm funnel I I've got two monitors, so I I'm hearing and looking and funnel hacking you right now. Um, but yeah, I mean, dude, just your YouTube channel alone, just like the view of it, right? all the thumbnails, the titles, how you go about that structure. Like you're clearly crushing it for our niche of the niche. Um, yeah, this is fantastic. And then so they all go here to this build, grow exit, and then it's this long form page where they watch this VSSL on top and then Oh, I was going to say I was like, what is that? It's literally started autoplay. Um, very cool. So then they just book in direct and you've got a calendarly widget that has the questionnaire built in there. Yeah, that's it, dude. Straight to VSSL. Uh there's the whole page with the VSSL at the top. They click through to book a call, go to a Calendarly, fill out the survey, get booked in. Simple as that. And um the team is is really simple right now. Three closers, one setter, a VA, copyright, media buyer. That's it. That's amazing. That's amazing. Um I'm going to pop open X because we you uh got a lot of questions. People uh watch a lot of your content. So, we'll see what some people wanted to answer and then uh we can just riff from there. But okay. Yeah. Uh what uh what business model niche would current would the current you tell 23year-old William to get into? Dude, I would say either learn a high value skill and then teach it through a coaching program or don't learn a high value skill, just partner with someone with a skill. Build them a coaching program, partner with them. Just do info. Like if you want to just rack up cash. Like dude, my my my whole plan is make as much net profit as possible, buy real estate with cash as much as possible. That's that's that's my whole plan. That's been my plan for for eight bloody years, right? That that's all I've ever done. Make cash, buy real estate with cash. And that is what I would suggest to people is start an info business, make cash, buy real estate, and that's it. Yeah, that's I always talk about that too. the there's some young kid that has the Josh Josh is going to laugh when he watches this, but he has a thing called offer publisher that basically teaches people how to do that model. So, it's info or coach or whatever that teaches people how to basically find an expert and build the business model around them and then you own a lot of the time majority and you own all the IP. So, they do it in a way now where you own like the whole brand and the bank accounts and the whatever and the expert is like, you know, on the stack but not the other way around. And I think that's a beautiful model. Wow. Damn, dude. That was a [ __ ] great. So, all right. That's uh that's number Oh, sorry. Our our there's a lag. Didn't mean to interrupt. Um but no, it's it's a cool model. I think that that's basically how our model was created was that similar way. uh I came in again they had done it without me and started without me on that but I know people who are cruising with that that'll own 70% of some IP around some niche and hire in experts to come in and they're on the cap table or the you know profit share whatever thing you want to call it depending uh but they'll do size yeah so good man that is a great model yeah 100% um all right next question are you still skateboarding from time to time. [ __ ] no. I'm [ __ ] 34 years old. You're in Bali, though. They have that bowl. They have that one uh what's that place called? That's over there that everyone goes and uh the bar in the middle and then there's like the whole skating bowl in the back. You got to go. I think you can do it. No, no, dude. Those days are dude, skateboarding, amazing over graffiti, amazing over music was [ __ ] amazing, but I'm glad that's over. Info is the best. info in real estate, man. That's the best. That's fun though. I didn't know. Yeah. I mean, I don't really have a lot of hobbies. So, you you did all those. Those were like passion projects of life. Was that was that during when you were doing that or after? No, it it was one by one. So, like my first ever thing that I really really loved was skateboarding, right? And I did that for a few years when I was young. Off the back of skateboarding, I got into graffiti and I did graffiti for probably three, four years. had the magazine, you know, and eventually got bored of that. Through that, I got into uh music because some of my graffiti friends were like would DJ and then I got into DJing and their music. Started making my own records. Got signed to a pretty good uh record label. Immediately I was touring all over the world, which is super fun, for about five years. But the the money was not very good. You know, some months I'd make four grand, some months I'd make nine grand, some months I'd make $400. So, it was so up and down. It taught me capital management. I'll say that. It really taught me capital management. And then I was looking for another way to make money which led to trading. I I saw a trading documentary on TV, opened a account and and that kind of kicked off. That became the education business. So, I've always just whatever I've loved, I've always made a product out of it, basically. And it's like become a business. That's that's the recurring theme across my life. I've always loved something, made it a business. Love something, made it a business, you know? Yeah. Well, then landing in info and real estate is probably good. They all tie back there. Anyway, u next one we got on here is his LinkedIn strategy. We definitely need to talk about this. Oh, the [ __ ] LinkedIn strategy. Well, dude, it's it's it's really simple. I mean, um I've got the copywriter who writes copy. He also posts it. I think we do one a day now. Uh that shows how professional I am. I don't even know what we [ __ ] do on on a key platform. Don't even know the distribution gate is. I think I think we do one post a day and my setter goes in the inbox, chats to people, sets people. We don't book many calls from it. We only book not many, not many. 10, 15, 20 a month. But that's the strategy. Post content, message people, set them, close them. That's it really. How are you tracking uh kind of technical question but how are you tracking that you know 70% of them come from you know YouTube 20% here just from the form that's on the questionnaire or do you have like a technical backend version of that? It's just Hyros. Yeah, we just have the Hyros tag on. So the LinkedIn setter would have a LinkedIn tag and Instagram would have an Instagram tag. So we just feed it into Hyros. Yeah. So do we. We use Hyros for the journey so we can see it and then we use like a custom setup to feed the pixel because we're doing so much paid ads. But if we weren't doing paid and I would still pay for it just for the journey like being able to click in there. I think they do the best with that. Definitely, mate. Yeah. Have you uh so when you were quick on Becker, I mean you're a longtime Becker consumer, right? Like you've seen his stuff for a while then if you were an iron. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Did you do stuff like before that like any of his ecom journey and that whole piece or was I mean he did a lot of things before that but talk about a guy who just crushed it and just took a hold of what he wanted to do and the person he wanted to be and it's just like his lifestyle now his you know how he continues to be like raw authentic himself and not some you know I mean I guess he is some character but like I think that character is actually him the software play the info play the bigger now software AI stuff the crypto play like what an evolution of a human. Yeah, dude. So inspiring, man. I think um Alex has definitely inspired that part in me of just simplicity, you know, no stupid [ __ ] I've never I've never wasted money. I've never bought a supercar. I've never bought a particularly expensive watch. I've never I've never really wasted money. My dad always like sold the seeds of seeds of doubt in in my head. And ever since I was young, my dad was always like, "Save all your money. Make sure you invest it well. Don't waste it. you know, it could go away tomorrow and he would always say that. So, I think like I took a lot from Becca in terms of just keep it real and just do what you want to do and focus and don't be a knob basically. Um, but yeah, dude, I just found Becca probably 2019 and then I remember I was DJing in London one night. I was in the hotel and I saw a YouTube ad for iron and I booked a call and and bought it a few days later and changed changed my life for sure, man. So, yeah. Interesting. So, that was your like that was the core one that drove this last business was was iron. Oh, dude. By far. Yeah. So up. So I started the last company in 2018 and it and it was just organic until until until I found Becca and we we weren't doing a lot of money. We were doing 30k a month, 40k a month organically. And then I found Becca and dude like I learned what a funnel was. I learned what YouTube ads were. I learned how to write copy. All of that stuff. And that is what got us from 30 40 a month to to [ __ ] hundreds a month is pretty much all thanks to that program. So yeah. Yeah, it was so smart of him to like Trojan horse the I mean he even says they say it on the sales call it's like we don't even care about the money the five grand or the 10 grand or whatever. I think yeah six I think you're actually I think it was actually that. Um and him being like no the whole goal is to get you to a size and show you how much you need Hyros and was getting all of these high ticket like these whales in this thing into Hyros and then it just spread like wildfire. I mean so what an interesting play. So smart man. Yeah. Yeah. He's And then his exit too, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think he sold I know that he I don't think he sold the full thing. I think he did something similar to me where he sold a a big percentage or something. But yeah, nonetheless, amazing. Yeah, I I've heard multiple numbers. I've heard I've had people in my DMs that have said different things like, "Oh, you know, the company that bought it and it was a stock deal and it went to, you know, 99% down." I've heard people say the deal didn't go through, like all this stuff. And it's like, bro, who cares? like he's clearly doing fine. He's clearly doing quite well for himself across his multiple ventures of life and personality. Like what a what a cool business in the space that he's been in forever. And then all the stuff he's done with crypto is hilarious. One and two, clearly very profitable for him. He's just funny, isn't he? He's just like a [ __ ] good guy. He's just funny. Yeah, that's what I mean. He's just so authentically him. At least you know what I think. But like, you know, even in the private groups or the small stuff, like that's how he acts and talks and then he just brought it to the public, right? And like he just has like just stays on that wave. He's a G. He's a [ __ ] G. He He's a G. He's an absolute G. Uh, what else we got in these questions? Um, how does he Oh, here we go. How does he look at exiting info business and should you even try to optimize for it? So, this is kind of how to I guess reframing this. What is the curriculum or approach that you use for that back-end product for the exit portion? Yeah. Right. Well, to answer that question, I may or may not sell or try to sell this company in the future. Right now, it's like very unsellable. Well, let me tell you how I would sell it, right? Because that will probably show how I think about the exit process, right? So if I wanted to sell this company, firstly I would decide on a number that I wanted to sell for. So I've got a goal and a target, right? Let's just say let's just say 10 million, right? So I want to sell this for 10 million. Well, like my last company was, it will probably be seen as a media business and valued at around 2 and a half to 4x. So let's say we're going to sell for 4x for for example. So I want 10 million. So I'd need to be doing about 2 and a half million a year ebidar. Two and a half times four is gets me to 10 million. So right well now we need to get to two and a half ebidar. And then obviously we need to start thinking about removing keyman risk uh hedging out the organic or bringing in other personalities with their own organic to feed it into the brand. We need to have very clean organized financials. We need to have a goodlooking solid track record. We need to have a good story as to why would someone why would someone want to buy us? Like what could they do next? Where could they take it? Is it a financial buyer that they're buying for the money? Is it a strategic buyer they're buying to do something with it? And just start getting to where you want to be ebidar wise thinking about who you want to sell to and getting the business in a salailable position. And uh I think that you should sell your company because it's either sell it or put it in the bin and it's either just turn it off and have nothing or at least sell it and get some [ __ ] money to walk away with, you know, because I think you'd be stupid to to just turn it off. So I think that's what I would do and that's what I think people should do. Yeah. My dad's always said like again landscape and snow, but his or you talk Sorry. Oh, there you go. I was the the lag is hilarious. I apologize if I'm interrupting. Um, but the my dad always says he has a mentor that said this. It was like, you know, you either exit the business, you sell it, or you exit it in your boots, right? And that's what a lot of these guys do. That's what 99% of businesses do, right? Is they go out in a stretcher, right? And it's they it just goes onto the airs, it closes down at whatever. Like you you just die in your boots. And that is just like a terrifying thought that both in lifestyle of like you never actually did the thing you were building for the whatever that is the freedom the number the whatever and you just never made it or you got into a position where yeah it's just that's it's just a very interesting frame to think about if you don't cash flow heavy on the way up and actually continue to live your life throughout it and you just never hit it. Then you optimize and you optimize and you try and you're going for some goal that you essentially never hit in your life which is crazy. Definitely. I think like you should prioritize net profit, build a bed of wealth so that even if you don't sell, you're still good. I think box number one that you need to tick is just get yourself solid. Save up a good amount of cash, a million, two million cash. Buy a home with cash so at least you're solid. You've got a you've got a home paid off. You're good. You know, that's like level one to me. And then if you don't sell, that's okay. If you do sell, even [ __ ] better. you've got more cash to to invest. That's kind of that was my playbook essentially. Yeah. I got to ask. So for your Bali set situation, those are like hundredyear leases, right? No. No. 30 years. 30-year leases. So you buy So you get 30-year the So you pay your million bucks and you get it for 30 years. And what happens in 30 years? I never understood this. Yeah. So my So this place was 900,000 US for 30 years and a h 100,000 for an extra 30 years. So I got a million literally a million cash for 60 years. Oh wow, that's so interesting. Yeah, that's so interesting. Like what happens in 60 years? Well, I mean I guess nobody knows, but like how has it happened? Have they done this for 60 years already or 30 years where you've seen what happens on the reup? Dude, give me two seconds to have a wait. I'm [ __ ] dying for a week. I can't concentrate. L literally give me 10 seconds. All right. And and I'll be back. Just two minutes. Okay. We'll just sit here and just me and the audience will sit here and stare at each other. [Laughter] That's why I like these conversations. They're raw. They're authentic. What's up, guys? Just you and me right now. If you're still here, we're at what? I got to open this up. We are rocking an hour and 42. So, comment 1.5, which is not true for anything, but just comment 1.5 if you're still here. And we're just still jamming about random [ __ ] dude. I was dying for a [ __ ] piss. Need that so bad. All right, that's my bad. No, I was Yeah, I was just talking one to one. I was like, "Comment 1.5, if you're still here right now, this might have to be the first one I edit where I edit a clip or I might just leave I honestly might just leave it raw." dead silence for like 20 seconds just just for the keep it keep on brand. We we both make raw YouTube videos. Believe it. This is raw. This is raw. This this is what it's called. This is real. This is real life. Just two dudes jamming 12 hours apart. Exactly. But anyway, um yeah, so my landlord actually lives in the little village behind the house. And when I bought it, they said to me, Indonesians like they don't want to inflate their lifestyle. So they would never need the land back cuz what they going to do with a mansion? you don't even want one. Uh so you can probably just keep buying 30 years, 30 years, 30 years. The price will go up. So that 100k for 30 years now might be, I don't know, quarter of a million for 30 years later. But dude, I'm 34. The 60-year lease takes me up to 94 years old, you know. Probably going to be done by then, you know. Yeah, that's a fair that's a fair expectation. Um cool. Yeah, I mean I see all those guys do it. I don't know. the time zones for me. That's the other piece of like the freedom aspect is um me and my buddies have always talked about oh let's go do three months in Gold Coast or let's go do this or that and it's like I've always been like oh when the cash flow is X and when the lifestyle more so when I don't have these like meetings and that's what I do I operate the meetings right I operate the main cadence the that stuff so I would live this completely like dual lifestyle where I'm midnight basically taking calls or doing stuff and it's like that's not a freedom life either um so how big does this have to get or how operationally you know, machine to where we're not doing those and it's more checking in. You know, the um yeah, just that kind of style of things you hear about the guys like Tony or um I'm blanking right now, but uh you know that run 50 companies and have all these CEOs everywhere and bounce around and live like this whole life, but then that happens. I don't know, just not even there and skill set wise to get there. I I I hear that. For me, I think if I still had like a bigger business, a bigger team, a bigger operation, I might not have been able to move here because of the the timeline. So, the the time zone, but right now, people do calls kind of on my like I I I get to choose, you know, so they kind of just have to do the calls. But it's pretty good. The time zone's pretty good, actually. Yeah, I think this time zone's better than Dubai because you can get up early, take calls at 8, that kind of thing, and you're still hitting us. That' be 8:00 p.m. for you guys. So, yeah, it's not too bad at all. It's not too bad at all. And it's worth it to be here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of those people, everyone. I'm fitting Williams time zones and getting up at 4 or getting up at 3:00 a.m. to do calls and it works. So, lifestyle by design, baby. Uh, but no, I love it. I and I also think that because I'm like a 4:00 a.m. 5 a.m. kind of naturally but not usually these like I'll build during these times. So on that time zone it does work well for end of EST or those PST people right where it's 1 to 5:00 p.m. and for you it's you know 3 4 5 a.m. that would be good for me but then you live that lifestyle of you're in bed by 8 or 9:00 p.m. Uh which is actually kind of how I live right now but like yeah just the time zone thing has always been difficult. Our team is majority on North America is like North American time zones. Um we have some media buyers and stuff that are in Europe but they make all the team meetings that we have or the you know one or two a week that we have and optimize for our schedule. So kind of similar but again all around North America. So you go anywhere outside of that and it's like this London trip I'm like am I going to be okay? Like that's crazy that like I don't have the freedom level of an eight hour time difference or whatever it is to be like what happens to my meeting schedule or like what if there's a fire? Like I just haven't gotten there. You're in the weeds. You're in the weeds. I'm in the weeds for Yeah, dude. I am in so hard in the weeds right now. Like everyone's going to torch me in the comments because like you talk too much or this is about William, not you. And this is a conversation I like to have versus an interview style. But my my life right now is 16 hours a day at this desk and doing eight hours of what could be work. Like it's so scattered. It's the YouTube and X every single day. It's the checking Slack every 12 minutes. It's the all the team and then we're ramping a CMO. So, you know how that is, right? Like hours a day of in that world. We checked that box and now we did the same thing with sales and now I'm about to do the same thing with data, tech, and fulfillment because I'm trying to build it to where I have a sea level that I work with. Not I'm in the weeds of everyone's stuff and like I see the other side. I see the the you know the light at the end of the tunnel, but in current state, oh my gosh, I have no personal life whatsoever right now. Yeah. It it makes me think cuz dude, good god, I was there as well. I would just get up and work all [ __ ] day, seven days a week for years, for [ __ ] years. You know, and it makes me think either was that just a season and I've got it out of the way now and this is my next season and maybe I'll go back into that season later or was I doing it wrong? Is there a way to do it without working the hours under the sun and with more balance? If there is, I don't know it and I'd like to know it. I think I think you've either got to be all in like you or kind of be all out like me right now. I don't think there's a middle ground really. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. No, I I you see it right where there are people but like to get the result right is I think really those two options like if if the goal is what the goal is, right? And and yours is very clear and you are hitting it, right? Um, and then ours is clear and we're almost not hitting it with all the effort and the work and the team and stuff. We haven't hit it yet, but like when we do, it's like, okay, now we live in this new land of can we truly go two weeks, you know, I heard a hormone thing talking about how they go on like two week fake vacations basically and pressure test the company and they'll go, you know, two weeks without respond. I don't know, you know, what the actuals are and this is me putting words in people's mouths. So, but like are they not answering anything? Are they only answering by email but not solving anything? are that you know once a day I don't know what it actually looks like but talk about a way to pressure test on like does the company grow does it maintain are there fires that only you're able to put out now you need to hire for that does the P&L support that where you can hire for those positions or is it not big enough yet like yeah do well do I did that myself during our acquisition for I think the first time ever I went to Thailand with my girlfriend for two weeks and I was like right guys I'm not going I'm going to try my hardest to not look at Slack. I'm not going to look at High Roll or the calendar. I'm not going to be on any of the meetings and let's just see what happens. And we had one of our best twoe periods that that we'd ever had. So I was like, hm, it does it does run without me, you know, and it actually does better without me. Yeah. Being in the [ __ ] weeds, you know, shouting at everybody all the time. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing that we have is there's like three I don't like talk about like the net numbers and all of that. Like I talk about grow like you know roughly and like what a healthy margin is and stuff like that and talk rough but we have business partners so I don't really want to like doc you know they didn't choose to come out and say what their uh what their incomes are and stuff like that. So I don't think it's fair or like what the cap table is. But um the beauty and the demise version of having partners like that is like obviously you're splitting the pie which is so real. So, you know, say, let's just say it's thirds. Let's just say, uh, you know, you need to do three times the amount to make the same amount, which is a whole another thing to add to this is, you know, your 100k in profit is not 100K in profit. Let's say it's 33 33 like ish, let's just say. Um, that's a whole another thing of like how much size do you need? But the and the beauty of that though has been in the past there is some overlap on if these people are out or like one you know owner co-founder whatever is out the other people can kind of pick up the slack or there's always some level of leadership in there but talk about overlap in a negative way of where you kind of have similar skill sets or you kind of do the same thing the uh splitting of the you know profits and the and the cash of the company and then the it's just kind of difficult because it's like once you get to a certain in size is are all you know you can't have founder risk at all. So it's like all three of you are out and for us it was marketing and sales basically with one of the co-founders. He's very like he's very very much like us like we're like thickest thieves. Um so he's like the internet marketing version guy. He leaned into all marketing and sales. He was the one spending and doing the media buying up to like 20k a day like all of that world and then has now built out a team. Sales very similar. Um the other co-founder was like product face the expert right? So differentiation there and then mine was like tech systems and now more so like ops right because that just scales to being people what was once automations tech and like framework. Um and to this day I do all the marketing tech. So like I am the the lynch pin of that port or like the just break point of oh we want reporting around this or we're going to launch you know these three new VSSL funnels. I'm getting looms yesterday of like hey we need custom like how are we going to track this and I got to do all the HubSpot setup. So yesterday was the first day ever that I've done this, but I hired a a marketing tech yesterday that came from XYZ company that we can talk about offline, but has direct experience the entire software stack, the entire thing. And like that may be my unlock that I've been missing for two years or three years since I've been trying to like lean into doing this one and still holding my little tech zone. So it'll be interesting to see. Yeah, dude. I was just about to ask you that. I was just about to ask like when are you going to hedge yourself out and think about bringing someone in and then you just you answered it. You beat me to it. But have you ever heard of a guy called Wes Watson? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot that I don't really kind of, you know, believe in about what Wes kind of says and and does as such. I've never met him. I don't I don't really know him. But a little while ago, I saw him say something like, you know, if you can do it, just just do it yourself. And I think there's a time and the place for that to be true or not. I think in your case that's not true. I think in my case that is true. But for me, I think you should go, it just depends what profit margin you want. It just depends what [ __ ] profit margin you want. Yeah. And how much work you want to do, you know? That's what it comes down to. And there's no such thing as a a good or a bad margin, you know? like you you've had people on the channel that are doing sick, you know, 1 2 3 mil a month. I don't actually don't know what their margin is, but it's like it's just it's just what you want. And I'm I'm a big believer, build the business how you [ __ ] want it and don't don't let it run away from you. Don't let it become a Frankenstein like I did with my last company because I ended up with a business that controlled me. Yeah. Instead of me controlling it, it wasn't nice. Yeah. No, I I completely agree. And like the that's that constant game is like how much do you want to how much do you want to sacrifice of profit? Like the West model, right? It's like do it yourself. And like he's just a workhorse. Like that guy is an animal, right? He crushed I saw him speak at uh um Josh Snow has a mastermind or used to have a mastermind and we went to a couple of things and he had him come there and speak and he's just so intense. Like his numbers are crazy, right? He does like the most unconventional. They do, you know, DMs for high ticket basically and he'll just, you know, fire off a stripe link. He's like, I answer all the DMs like who needs setters. Like he's he's he's intense. Um he's intense, but yeah, it's lifestyle, right? Like he wants to and and lives that lifestyle kind of naturally. Um clearly, but yeah, that that's an interesting one. Um next question on here is a fun one. The is life as exciting after after the exit? Is life exciting? Yes, it is. Yes, it is in in in a different way. Right. So, when I was building that business, the excitement was can we build it? Can we grow it? Can we scale it? Can we sell it? How big can we take it? So, it was the it was exciting to learn it all and and do it all and discover it all. Right. And now the exciting part is having the control that I didn't used to have because when I was building that business especially towards the start I mean I I founded it from my mom's spare room and I had I was broke as [ __ ] you know so it was yeah a lot of importance on getting capital for freedom and choice and now I've got a lot of capital and freedom and choice. So the exciting thing now is I can do what the [ __ ] I want. You know, if I want to scale, I can scale. If I don't want to scale, I can not scale. If I want to hire, I can hire amazing people. If I want to run ads, I've got loads of money to put into ads. So now the excitement is is control and freedom and a bit more maneuverability now. So equally as exciting, just different types of exciting. Yeah, I respect so much. I feel like if you hot hot keyworded this entire transcript, it's like the amount of time you talk about the choosing the goal, identifying it for yourself, freedom, lifestyle by design. Like I feel like you've really like nailed that, right? And like that you're just like a living execution of that. And that's like that's cool to me that that's what your real goal is it sounds like and you're just and you're hitting it over and over again. and it changes and the seasons and like the goal does shift, but hit it, move to the next one, take some time to sit, reflect, get a Bali Villa, pick the next one, build it again. Like it's just this game of like iteration, which I respect. I think that's cool. I appreciate that, brother. Thank you. Yeah, 100%. All right, last tactical one and then we're already at two hours, which is hilarious. Uh YouTube long form tips for someone who wants to sell a product. I can ask this selfishly as well. I don't want to sell anything, but like I'm leaving so much meat on the bone. Um, and a lot of people are. There's a lot of the pros out there who are willing to, you know, everyone in their everyone is selling the personal branding, the how-to content stuff. Iman led this charge and now everyone sells it. Um, so what are your what are your tips for specifically your style? Like how have you approached your your content machine? Yeah, for sure. Well, God, there's there's a lot there's a lot to talk about, but I'll just give you some nuggets. So, one thing that's very important to me is the is the background and the setting of the the video because that like subconsciously communicates well communicates things so you can kind of pick what you want it to communicate. So, I always I almost kind of design a set for for the background of my office. You know, Dubai was the skyline, the 10 mill, the bookshelf and stuff like that. here. It's like the rice field view and stuff and it I just like the background to look clean and professional like you've actually put effort into it. So, that's one thing that's important to me. Um, another thing is just to keep it as real as possible in the videos. If you stumble, leave it in. If you mess up a word, leave it in, right? And if you can, don't script it and don't have bullet points. For me, I just I put 80% of my effort into the title. So the title always comes first for me. When I've got a title, then it I just start making a script in my head of like what I want to say. I just leave it in my head for a few days to start just coming together and then I hit record, talk, stop, upload, and just keep it as real as possible. There are occasions where I reshoot if I really lose my path and and mess it up, but it's pretty damn rare. So number one, setting. Number two, just keep it real and uh keep it raw. And number three, like just the the title carries a lot of weight for me. And if there's one thing that I've learned, right, it's all in the idea. If you have a great vid idea, a unique, one of my buddies uh who has a massive YouTube channel, he he called it remarkable. If your video is remarkable, like I sold my company to a private equity firm for millions and it's a remarkable video, you will win. You will get [ __ ] tons of views and traction. Yeah. So, just try and think of the most unique, remarkable titles and ideas possible. And if you do those three things, you're pretty far ahead to be honest. And and also like we were talking about earlier on the tactical side, for God's sakes, put your [ __ ] VSSL at the top of the description and make sure it's obvious where people should go, right? As obvious as that sounds, a lot of people don't do that, you know, stuff like that. Yeah. No, 100%. Yeah. I'm not optimizing any of that, right? Like the the one thing that people keep telling me if there was like the 8020 or the one the 991 is the packaging of these things which is what you just said right like the title and the like the big idea. What's the big idea and nailing that dude? What one other thing that I will say as well is basically don't have a thumbnail, right? just have the simplest, cleanest, most ambiguous thumbnail that you can because then all attention goes on the title. So instead of trying to make a great title thumbnail combination, one thing that's worked best for me is having a blank thumbnail that doesn't really tell you anything about the video because then people have to look at the title to find out what it's about. And then if you're good at titles, that is a big edge. So that's one thing that's that's worked for me in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. And obviously it's going to be different for, you know, entertainment or it's going to be different for this niche or the how to like that. But I am existing, you know, exactly within yours is super helpful for me. I a lot of people told me that they were like, "Hey, just make them super raw. Do a screenshot cuz I do everything on Miro cuz I do need the I need the bullets in order to keep me on track or I'll just tangent." And like sometimes they're great and sometimes they're not. And I don't want to have to, you know, I'm a one take kind of guy too. Like it takes me 30 tries to get through the beginning and then to like re-record to like try and nail that beginning and like here's what we're going to talk about and then once I break through one time it's like cool I can go for 20 minutes or 40 minutes cuz then it's raw. I don't care if there's little blips and stuff. But I just feel like the important the intro is so important and I even do a terrible job of my intro. It's like title quick here's what we're going to cover and then I do like the social proof like you know we did 30 million last year we've done 75 in total. I'm not selling you anything. Whatever. It like takes too long. It's just choppy. But trying to do them every day has been very difficult for me to keep within a small time frame. Yeah. I You know what? So, one thing, one thing I thought way back in the day when I was starting this channel, I I remember thinking, what video would I love to watch and I thought, man, I would love it if Sam Ovenans just sat there and told me lessons without any plan or editing. I thought, wow, that'd be amazing. What Alex Becker doing the same thing, Cole Gordon, whoever. So I thought, well, if that's what I would want, well, let me just try and give that to my audience and see if they want it because, you know, if I want it, there's probably other people who do. And that's been very true. You know, a lot of people have said to me, man, like, I just like how you just tell us stuff in a very real, chilled out way, you know, the same for you as well, you know. Yeah. No, I mean, your stuff's great. like I just found that section that's like what other channels do people watch and I kind of clicked through them and I had already watched you know a handful of your videos. Um but I binged and I I don't know. I love the style. Obviously I do this style. It's what I like to consume and you got to assume that the person that watches it is someone who's similar to us who doesn't want the crazy editing and the flashy this and that and the pre, you know, pre-recorded stuff. I try and watch them every once in a while cuz I'm like, "Oh, that's like a great title." Or like, "Oh, that would be so interesting." And I get so lost in like the I don't know. I like can't do that style of of consumption even when it's like all flashy. I'll throw them on 2.5x or try and skip around to just like the tactical portion just for how I operate. Um so I think we serve a niche of people that that do it is interesting to me like the watch time and I'd be like I don't know where yours sits but I do ramble a bit. I do kind of go in these directions as we're doing here, but like there's people that I just threw on there like, oh, 1.5, you know, comment 1.5. And the amount of people that watch full through is very interesting to me. But the blended number is very low. It's 7 minutes, it's 12 minutes, it's whatever. And most my videos are say 20. So it's sub 50% which is like not good, right? The retention is my is not fantastic. But the people that do consume and having the ability for people to consume if they want to, I think is like a pretty cool moat of like where someone can get to know you, can understand how you think, like you said. Um cuz there's plenty of people. Jackie Chow is a great example. He does like a build in public thing. He's a big SEO guy and he does like a daily video. And when I came upon his stuff, I literally clicked on the playlist and flipped it on its head so I could start in the beginning and watched like I don't even I was in Puerto Rico and bored and whatever and was working. threw it up on this screen and I seriously had to have watched tens of hours over a couple days of just every video in a row and just got to think about like how he sees things and all that. Dude, I did that with your channel as well when I first found it. I went on I went to the oldest first and just started watching every single one in order. You know, I was doing that last night as well. I was having a cigar outside and I picked up where I left off and just watched like seven in in a row. Um, and I think people like us generally will watch the entire thing, even if it takes a little while. But for me, for my channel, all I look at is views and booked calls. I don't look at click-through rate. I don't look at watch time. I'm just like, how many views? How many calls? That's that's all I care about. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, that's the result. That's the goal you're going for, right? Do you do anything within the videos? I mean, I kind of already know the answer, but for everyone who hasn't. Uh, do you do anything in the videos to kind of frame for that call like your CTAs and all that, just for anyone who's listening? Dude, most of the time I forget to do it, you know? I just I Yeah, most of the time I don't do it. Sometimes I do if I remember, but I I almost don't want to give people a call to action. I want people to choose to go looking for a call to action because then the intent is so much better, you know? Yeah. No, I agree. Um cuz I mean I watched some of them and some are some are kind of there but yeah majority of it's just like good quality content that then you know people are drawn to do it. Um, I think the hormosi model of that and how like they definitely optimize, right? They have that example where it's like the links are right there. They do the comment with the pinned one. Like they do they optimize for the click, but he layers in some CTAs, but they do such a good job of doing it as like the true lowhanging fruit, the book, the whatever free courses. Like talk about talk about value the courses that are on their site. I don't know if you've ever gone through those like the scale, the leads. He has full courses that basically go along with the books that he's created that are on his site that are tens of hours. Like, you know, something someone would charge 10 grand for. Yeah. Onacquisition.com. It's like the learn whatever. Actually, I have it open right now. Wow. Yeah. They have a thing on top of their site called courses. It's scaling offers and leads. And you click on scaling. It's like 16 hours or something. Offers one is the entire book. Um leads is Yeah. So, it's cool. But he pushes those in the in the comments a lot and anyone who consumes that is going to like his model of if you're a beginner and go to school and if you're more advanced or building go into here and now having all the workshop and education layers and then the back end being oh we're going to own a portion of your company either buying it or just you know receiving it is so cool to me. Yeah, dude. It's if if you can do that that is the best model you're doing that right now. You're giving mad value away for free. you will be doing this for a very long time. You might put out some free courses and stuff as well and then eventually you're just going to have immense deal flow and you can just be very picky about consulting. You can be very picky about you might partner with people. So it's a it's it's a it's a great play. It's a great play. Yeah. Yeah. The I mean the true goal of this entire thing was the network more than anything. It was like, you know, in the cave for however many years and like didn't leave the apartment, let alone leave the virtual apartment and like go, you know, try and meet like friends or network or whatever you want to call it online at all. Nothing on Instagram, no X, obviously no Z uh YouTube. Um, and it's been astounding to me the level of quality, the positive feedback loop. Like, it's crazy that I did not do this earlier. Um, I'm kind of glad I didn't because it obviously allowed me to kind of come into it with enough that at least I think is a little bit valuable to share and like spew from my brain. Um, cuz all I've done is consume for 10 years. All I've done is just be a consump and like you know obviously implemented it and have some experience and a little bit of skill around it. Um, but a majority of what it's been is just like regurgitated or you know consumption based stuff and now it's the complete opposite. It's like I feel like I'm like I hate it at some level where it's like I'm no longer I don't feel as much student. I like the teaching aspect cuz you have to like simplify it and think of it in a good way in order to explain it or teach it. I think there's huge value in that. But the lack of consumption I have now and just spewing and like I don't know. I feel like it can kind of come off as like I know everything or like this ego play and that's the last thing I want. So that's why I try and share like the L's and like the what's hard now and what's happening. Um but yeah, I don't know. It's like that dance. I feel like I definitely agree with that. I try and, you know, like I did with you earlier. I was trying to admit some of the stupid [ __ ] that I've done to just show people like I'm not I'm not not some crazy god guy. I'm just a random idiot who's learned a few things and done it for a while, you know? So, it's funny. Yeah. Yeah. All right, we're coming up on two or we're over two now. anything you want to leave everyone with or any other final topics you want to cover? I think we've covered a lot. Yeah, we've we we've ran for a while actually. I think we've covered a lot. Yeah, it's been fun. We've seen the sun go down in your in your background, so uh we we've we've probably hit about our time. My sun's coming up right now, actually. So, it's perfect. So good, man. So good. Yeah. No, it's been fun. Hope Cool, man. Yeah. No, it's been fantastic. I definitely want to stay in touch. What is actually last question on this? Who is like your ideal like right now ICP? I mean I know you have multiple offerings and everything low ticket which is probably more beginnery or you know actually probably not because someone who's building and scaling but um yeah who's the ICP? Yeah I mean the ideal ICP is someone who's already going but they're small. There's a lot that they don't know. There's a lot that they need help with. Like I can double, triple, quadruple those people's businesses so [ __ ] fast. So, if there's someone watching this and you're at 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, 40, 50ish range, dude, I can grow the hell out of your business. So, that's the the ideal, but honestly, we can work with anyone, you know, anyone that has a skill, a talent, specialist knowledge that they want to package up and sell at a high level, high profit level, you know, kind of like I'm doing is is a perfect fit, I would say. Interesting. Yeah. I I wouldn't imagine that it was that that uh like low of a threshold, but it completely makes sense. The ability to two, three, four. Yeah. So, all right. Well, anybody there's tons of people who watch this, I'm sure, that have that. So, William actually sells things and gets people results. So, go check it out. Uh I just spew. So, you guys rock. I appreciate you. Let's definitely stay in touch. Let's do uh I want to do an update on this in x amount of months or whatever as this evolves. maybe even, you know, a year down the road when we get in a position where we're on the exit side of things or not or we completely change the model and go back to being, hey, this is going to be a big cash cow like we thought it was going to be forever up until 6 months ago. So, things change quickly. Let's see. Let's see. We'll revisit this later. We will. All right. You guys know where to find him. Search his name. He's on X. He's on YouTube crushing. So, I will talk to you all tomorrow. What's today? The 31st. So, tomorrow I'll do the month in review video and have some fun updates on where we hit last month. So talk to you guys soon.

# $75M Q&A: Offers, Funnels, Hiring, Cold Traffic | EP79
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ilqvdFtQw

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to have some fun and go through our weekly weekend Q&A round five. All these questions were submitted to the request box over the last week, and today we're going to deep dive every single one of them. We have everything from how to find partners to how do you get [ __ ] done, scaling offers with limited money, some of the best courses for paper call, acquiring talent, mindset, all of the things. We have a lot of context and a lot of in-depth questions today. So, I think this is going to be very tactical and helpful. I promise you that you are going to learn something or come up with some idea from some a question someone has asked. So stick around to the end and check it out. Last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now as of today crossed over 75 million. I can finally get that last disc in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No courses, no mentorship, no consulting. I don't want your money. Everything on the channel is just showing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing right now to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent for our company opportunities and building a network of cool people building cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. It is Friday at 8 PM, so we're kicking off the weekend strong. Let's go. You start from scratch today. No money, just experience. How would you pitch your service building a full infrastructure around someone's brand to potential partners in an email? Thank you. Um, so what it sounds like you're trying to do is basically do the like um publishing style. So you're going to come in and take an expert and build a business around them. So you're going to try and pitch them via email. I've never done any cold outreach, so I'm not your person for that part. Sorry. Um I'm not going to pretend like I am. So there are tons of people. Let's go through this instead actually. So the way that I would go approach this is how I approach all these other things is find somebody who has what you want or has done this and uses this process and model it off of them. Okay? So you're going to find someone on YouTube, you're going to find a course, you're going to find a Facebook community, you're going to find something that you can join and see how people are doing this cold outreach model if that's how you're trying to do that. Um the other piece of this is if you just have no no money and no experience, you either need to kind of go about it two approaches. If you have no experience, you have no case studies. So you're kind of selling error and you're selling the dream of some result. If you have the confidence to do so and you want to be the person who kind of like fix it till you make it selling, which is not necessarily a problem at all. Um you just go at it. You just, you know, do volume. You find somebody who will do that. The other option is to do it more so on the trust basis, which is, you know, approaching this kind of candidly. I haven't done this. I've seen other people do this. This is how the model does work. This that's how I started. Uh this is how the model does work and I want to try it and I want to build this around you. You know, give me 90 days to get XYZ results. The other thing is when you're pitching your service, uh how you're pricing it. So, you want to make the offer good. You want to, you know, in the beginning if you don't have case studies and you don't really have the confidence around it, it's kind of hard in my opinion to sell something that's 10 grand or 50 grand or some whatever. But if you want to take a percentage, if you want to do performance based, if you want to do it for free to get a couple case studies or do it free plus performance, right, is like generally how I've how I've always done things is if you get the performance, you get paid. Um, so there's some trust factor in that and then yeah, you can just come to it very candidly. That is like, you know, I've never done this and I want your trust basically. Um, and there are people that will land with that are probably more in alignment with you. Um, or you can swing for the fences, but it is very, very doable. Um, Josh Gavin has a course on this. I think what you're talking about is building a business around someone's brand, like an expert. Um, that's all they do. Offer publishing is what they're calling it. So, you basically find an expert and build that business. So, hopefully that's helpful. How to find partners. Um, I assume you mean business partners. Uh, but for partners, I kind of look at it. Let's do this. I look at it look at them in three kind of buckets. You have like people who are ahead of you or like mentor style people. You have people who are in the trenches that are kind of at the same level as you. And then you have other people that are at, you know, behind you a little bit. And I don't mean that in a negative way just like you have more experience in business or whatever you know industry or financially or life in general and those people. So you have those three buckets when finding the top ones mentors you either are paying for them or you are in the right rooms and they see value in you and you can bring something to the table that they don't have or they see some grit in you. They see something. um finding them just overall is being in the right rooms, getting the right network, um providing value in the right way that you get noticed for those people in the trenches. That's kind of a lot easier. That's the majority of them. That's how most businesses that have partners are started, right? It's like two people that want to do something together. They have a shared vision. They have a shared experience currently and ideally they have different skill sets that complement each other. So there's not too much overlap because there's a lot of pain there. Um and then the last one, so that one's like the easiest to do. I found business partners inside course communities. I've made friends inside course communities. I've made friends in free communities and on X and wherever else, right? So like just people that are in the same situation that have the same desired goal is someone who could identify as a partner. Uh again, I think it's important that you have differentiating skill sets or ones that complement each other. And then the last piece of that with uh is someone who is you know basically wants to come like mentor mentee under you and that's way easier but you need you know the experience the clout the whatever you want to call it. Um, and not to like toot my own horn or anything, but like now with like a small audience I've built, I'm sure I could post and find media buyer that would want to be a partner for X% for example or something else like that. Like I have Martekch guys that want to do that. So I hope that's helpful. Um, you can look a lot of places to actually find them, but internet's a great place. I've met my business partners online to start. Um, all of them that I've ever worked with actually. Um, and yeah, I think it's a great model. Would love to hear your would love to hear about your iteration process. AB testing process. How you test new VSSL, new leads, new LPS, optin pages, especially now with AI, we can pop up dozens of new leads for our VSSL if we want to. Dozens of new ads, dozens of everything, but how the heck do we allocate budget to that many new assets? You define, you don't just throw everything at the wall. You do kind of for sure, but like you don't you find the ones that are actually you think are the best that you have a thesis that are that is that these are going to be the best. You you know write out why you think they are and you give them an adequate amount of time to test. So, let's start from the top. VSSLs. If you're running a, let's make this simple. If you're running a DTA funnel, so you're running direct to application and you have a headline, a VSSL, and a button, you keep everything isolated and completely the same. Yes, you're going to have different ads that are all running to them, but that is part of the that that's a that's a consistent constant of that. Um, you can route singular ads to singular ones, but then you mess with your, you know, variations in your splits. So, you're going to run one campaign to multiple pages that are splitting. Other people will run the same dupe an entire campaign and run it to two different URLs. We don't do that now. Uh we just do, you know, we use VWO for ours. They will land on the page and you'll split the traffic. If you have a control, you're generally speaking going to keep it call it 80% of the traffic and only split 20% because you don't want to screw with it if the other one tanks. Um so a lot of the time you'll do splits that are actually much less in terms of that. Um but a normal is 50/50 if you don't know off the rip and you're testing. You're going to test your new VSSLs. And for us, depending on what your goal is, if you're testing VSSL that goes direct to cart, if you're testing VSSL that is to book a call funnel, whatever, you're going to have everything that happens after the fact. So, let's use a VSSL call funnel. You are going to have a you're going to have an application, you're going to have a booked call, and then you're going to have a purchase. Now, the most important thing there is a purchase, and you need to be able to tie that back. And that's like the most important part because even if the other VSSL gets 50 times more calls but only gets two sales and the other one gets 10 calls and gets five sales, that one's the winner, right? Depends on what you're optimizing for, for sure. But like, let's be real, the the goal here is to get a low cost per purchase. And none of the other metrics matter in the end. Um, except for how they divide out and get to there. So, you're going to want to crown winners on that. For new leads, same thing. You're going to have your VSSL that wins and then your full VSSL that wins. And then you're going to then roll into leads. And you're going to test this variable at a time. You're not going to run this nine wide unless you're spending tens of thousands of dollars a day over x amount of time. And you know your time from lead to purchase because you need to let it run through. Okay. Opt-in pages very similar. Um in my opinion, we you also will test those uh to purchase. You can have an opt-in page that claims the world and another one that is more realistic. The more realistic one gets a lower opt-in rate. The hyper crazy whatever promise one gets all the optin rate in the world. And one maybe it's not compliant. And two, even if that gets higher opt-in rate, it does not necessarily mean that you get more applications, bookings, and call and uh purchases, you need to do what is your revenue per lead essentially on that and understand where that comes from. So that is some backend tracking for sure, especially when there's time to lead. You can't just use a tool out of the box that's just, you know, based on page clicks. I'm sure there are is one, but it's just cleaner to store in your own CRM. Dozens of everything. How do we allocate budget into that? So yeah, I would isolate those. is you bring the winners into one bucket and when you're doing splits once you have a control you slow split you split where they are a lesser percentage. So hopefully that was helpful. I didn't mean to burst a bubble at all but yeah there's a lot of other metrics that go into that and it's really important that you know your from split to conversion the time between that because you need to be able to run it for that time for everyone that you run through and test. Uh one of the OGs used to say that it was 50 that would have conversions to know which one's a winner. I think it's higher. I think it's, you know, hundred and something, but that's based on the person, that's based on the budget, that's based on the comfort level, the scale, all the things. So, hopefully that was helpful. Um, feel free to ask another one if that didn't answer. Are you current currently running any high ticket funnels that convert from paid ads without a closer? I'm trying to sell two products, 47 this. How would you approach this without a closer? Yeah, we do not. We've never done this. Uh we like OG gogg did the $497 option which we then took to a call funnel which was crazy behavior cuz $497 over the phone is like way too low generally cuz imagine you're getting a $100 call and then 50% of them show up so you have a $200 call uh or live call and then you close whatever one in four of those. So that's what $800 and you you made $500 before fulfillment. Like the math doesn't work. Um so these you can do direct to cart. A lot of people do VSSL to direct to cart. They do webinar direct to cart. Um, yeah. I mean, I know a lot of people that do a th000 to $2,000 products direct to cart. So, it's just figuring out which funnel type is going to work best for you. Live webinar, pre-recorded webinar, VSSL, and then just having good messaging copy and all that kind of stuff around there. Generally, this does need that type of sales process. It's not where you just send them to a lander and they check out. That's usually for a lower ticket thing. Um, so yeah, that's how I'd approach it. There's, you know, Alen Sultanic has a bunch of stuff in his Nothing Held Back. There's also the model where these are the back end of a funnel. So you sell something that's like, you know, $27 that then ascends them up to these, whether these are direct cart inside the funnel, like inside the upsells as Otto's or this is on the back end, you know, once they're in the program, they can click to buy an upgrade or they book a call and then you sell it through that. So yeah, that's how I do it without a closer. I do like the closer game. I think there's more room for error. I think you can scale it up um a little bit easier and then do this part after. But that's my personal opinion. So this definitely works. I can promise you that. Like there I've podcast the interviews. Brooke Hittink was talking about how he does one right now that's like $9.97 up to $19.97 um like $2,000 and he's cranking on that right now and it's a VSSL to direct to cart or a webinar direct to cart. I've nailed creative and sales copy. Let's go though. I've only ever deployed in an organic context. 800 million views generated on complicated top topics. Nice. I'm going to pivot into paid ads next month. Why? And have the capacity to create 28 pieces of new video each week for testing. That's plenty. My offer and funnel are dial. I've been told by ad spenders around the world. Me doing a moderate spend 10,000s a month that creative is most out of the battle when it comes to meta ads. True. Assuming your offer and funnel is dialed. Would you agree with this or is targeting equally difficult to master? No, I would not. Uh yes, I would agree. I would I do not think it's difficult. for context have generated over $700,000 organically though only at around a 40% margin against that's an this is the most interesting part of this on how you're only doing 40% profit margins and you're doing everything organic maybe you have like a big marketing budget of like creating the organic content and that's what that is um but yeah you got to be careful with that because if you're not in you know high multiples of rorowaz you know the 5x or the whatever do the quick math just for your new revenue if you're doing new rorowaz and you spend $1 and you make back two then you only have50 50% margin, right? Is you know, I mean, it's kind of different, but we're just going to use this as an example. Then you're burning cash. You're out of money because that math doesn't work. So, that's why a lot of time you'll hear like these organic guys talk about having like 60 to 80% margin and then the guys who do it on paid are like 30 to 40%. Um, because that 30% or whatever, they'll get eaten by cash or uh eaten by ad spend. So, they'll spend a million bucks to make three or four million bucks, which is, you know, 25 to 33% of their thing month over month. But that's also why backends exist and why big bigger businesses have backends. Acquisition is high. That's fine. Whoever can, you know, pay to the most to acquire customer wins type energy. Um, so yeah, it's kind of a deeper question there. One, I don't really know why you're going to paid ads. I mean, there's an easy land grab for like retarget and stuff, but to crack cold is a little bit different. And if you're already doing this, like it sounds like it's working. Um, but 800 million views to 700K is really I don't know the exact math, but that doesn't sound good. Um, so I don't know if these are not conversion focused or if your mechanism for conversion isn't working or if the back end isn't there, but I would probably need some more context on this and it's just my opinion. We don't we don't nail organics, so I don't have the numbers for you. Almost like 1% of our attribution is firstclick organic. Everything's paid. So I don't have a ton so not going to pretend like I have the perfect answer for you, but ask another one maybe. But that was that was a good one. How do you get [ __ ] done? I [ __ ] I [ __ ] it up. I don't get [ __ ] done. I do, you know, sit at this desk for 16 hours and I could probably do the work in eight if I was focused. I bounce around like crazy. Um I've had periods of like fantastic of this. My best system is I just, you know, naturally I'm fired up and I'm up at 4 in the morning and I come to this desk and I work from 4:00 to 7:00 or 8 when I'm building stuff and that's like my nobody [ __ ] with me time and then I roll into meetings and just back and forth. But I am a XYZ of I it's like the dopamine of I check an email and then check a text and then pop on X and then I have nine Slack messages and then I'm on a random meeting and then I'm on this or I pull a report and like I'm terrible at this. So this is actually something I'm actively getting better at doing and working on. Um but how I would get [ __ ] done, it's leverage, right? So it's like you have your time and then you have other people's time and you have code and you have media and you have all the things. But like the ne the first layer is just optimizing yourself. That's why everyone talks about like the morning routines and the you know time blocking and structuring and doing high leverage activities you know the next being like labor and having team that can do it because it's you know you working through team so now you have four people under you have four times the amount of production in terms of hours right and then you have a players and they are better at you than something and they can do it better then has a cost to it so there's a whole game here but yeah optimize you first and get that I'm constantly working on that I'm not perfect in theing slightest um and yeah so work on you work on having an A team, work on having things that work without you, AI, automations, um, you know, whatever type of code, work on things that are evergreen, like brand and content, work on things like that. So, or make a bunch of money and have your money work for you. It's kind of the leverage model, the four C's or whatever they call it. I've heard you say if you started from scratch, you'd find the expert and build the systems around them. I do bisop work for a growing influencer in the niche luxury space with 25,000 followers and deep expertise in high ticket product world, fashion. Okay. I'm planning to start with a low ticket front-end guide to build trust and then ascend into medium ticket with other offlers similar to what you mentioned on your videos. What would be a playbook to get from zero to 10K with a low in mind? Okay, wait. So, let's let me understand this. I do bisop work bisop for a growing influencer in the niche luxury space with 25,000 followers and deep expertise in high ticket product world. Don't sell them low ticket. They are high ticket people. You sell one person and make 10 grand. I I don't think I don't know if I'm fully understanding this, but if like there's no harm in we just now started selling something that's low ticket for economics and scale and brand awareness and stuff, but we've been selling things that are high ticket, which aren't even this high ticket. Um like high ticket product world, like fashion in a long like ever. Um that's like the honeypot. Um Dan Kennedy has a book on this. It's like selling to the affluent. Go read that. Um but that is like a life hack. An absolute life hack. And you see the meme that's like, you know, someone with a 5k invoice that's like follows up 19 times and when's work going to get done and then someone else that's 50k wire that's like, you know, I wire sent, let me know. And it's like kind of that energy. But if you're selling to a niche that is high ticket product world, you don't need to then sell them something low ticket or they view it as cheap. You need to match the market. Um, am I maybe I don't know that if I fully understand this, but you need to match the market on that. And if you wanted to do this, yeah, something that's community based, something that's it's just low ticket is just value. So, you need to give them something valuable enough that frames them in the way that it makes sense to have ascend into a high ticket offering. But if you just have a high ticket offering, I don't know what this is, but I you can just go straight to that with a callunnel very easily if there's a good offer and the market's there. Hey Ryan, I've taken your advice and invested into mentorship. Oh man. Um, for context, we build pre-all systems that increase close rates and shorten sales cycle. Send it my way, brother. Um, and I say brother and guy because 3% or it's like 2.2% of my audience is female on every platform. So, hate to see it, but seems that's what our industry is. So, we're going to keep saying guys. Here's the thing. I don't really want to take this offer into the info agency space despite having been a closer and using these systems myself for the past three years. That's fine. The life hack is using all this digital marketing stuff outside of the space in landscaping, in software, in whatever. I mean, like software is probably a bad example, but like some of these other ones, like any other industry that you then layer digital marketing in versus selling to other digital marketers and info and coaching to info and coaching people is like such a life hack. Um, yeah, despite having many clients in this niche already because you have networks, of course, uh, it's just so saturated. I don't have the mental mental energy to talk on camera all day. I don't get why you'd have to talk on camera all day for this, but not another one. More of a systems guy. Would rather pay someone for outreach and just take sales calls. That being said, I want to target highle B2B companies with an abundance of call demo. Agreed. 100% agreed. Since you're savvy with marketing, you probably understand my offer very well. Happy to dive into mechanism another time. I'd love to hear how you go about landing some meetings by providing value to high level guys who aren't binging YouTube. Also, how would you position my offer to cold traffic? Um, I don't really understand that. I'd love to hear how you would go about landing some meetings by providing high value to to providing value to highle guys who aren't binging YouTube and how you'd position my offer to cold traffic. First off, a lot of highle people binge YouTube. Let's be very clear. It's the whole market's here. Um, just depends on what part of the of YouTube and the internet you live on. There are guys that'll sit here and have four hour videos on taxation that you can sit and that are worth $10 million and watch YouTube videos with their bourbon at 12 PM or at, you know, whatever [ __ ] time. So, I don't think that that's really what it is. But, I mean, you'd position your offer the same way you position any offer. What's the likelihood to get the result? How good, you know, does it solve their problem? Like, you know, go read Alex Hormosy's offers book and you'd position your offer in that way. And then, yes, niche down and target one of these industries is not info coaching. If you don't want to work with info agency coaching space, go work in go help Dennis get better show rates for appointments. go help whatever business model that uses call funnels like exclusively like software demos for example like um you know Oracle some of the big like accounting agencies that do demos like just stuff like that I mean you're going to know your ICP better than I am but go and niche on that target and then live in their land and own that thing and then yeah make an offer go read Alexi's book he's going to tell you how to do this 50 times better than I am on how to position the offer but it's essentially like the value equation he has so make an offer that's so feels like you people feel stupid saying no to type vibe and go do that. So hopefully that's helpful. How to scale an offer with limited money. You don't need any money to scale an offer um with depends on the acquisition source. You can do it for through organic. You can do it through affiliates and partnerships. There's a guy that I know that does over 100 million a year and it's just partnerships. They've never run an ad, never done any organic marketing, nothing. They just have like, you know, a brand name and that they have referrals through affiliates. So you don't need money at all. You just need to do service delivery and then you pay them a CPA. So, partnerships, stuff like that. The other option is like we started ours with, you know, a couple thousand dollars in a bank account. Um, like literally like $2,000 and then you just bootstrap. You sell a bunch of people, you know, organic audience, cold reach out or cold outreach. You sell people and then you use the cash to reinvest and you just build and know that you don't take money out for a little bit until you scale up to a size that it's making money that is, you know, free cash that that's actually profit, not just, you know, next month's rent. Um, and then yeah, you go from there. So, a lot again, a lot of this stuff on this, a lot of build a business. Start with something that's service work. So, it's your time that you're spending instead of having to pay people um or a hard cost like you know, I keep saying landscaping, but selling something that's a backyard that has x amount of materials and you don't know the math and you don't know how to do this and your hourly rate for your team and all that. It's like yes, you can do that and people crush it with everything with floors with that. But, yeah, I would just go and start something that's service- based. I have a post on X where I ask people what they would do if they wanted to start from zero and there's a ton of good answers on there. It's affiliate there, stuff like that. But when you're saying offer, that's what I think. Where would you start if you had to start again right now? Um, I answered this in the last one. I basically said I would find an expert and I would build the entire thing around them. And now if I had the experience and understanding I have now, I would be able to get a majority of the company, I would imagine, around some expert and I would just do what I did all over again. Something with a massive backend. So something like financial services, something like um entertainment space that has like high commissions on the back end for placements, something that has like millions of dollars on the back end that you can get uh is something that I would do instead of just something that's info coaching on the front and like supplementary things and like partnership side deals. I would do something that has a massive [ __ ] back end and just put an expert in the front of it. Um a fundamental question, how can a person start an offer with minimum amount of money? I need you to go into detail with which niche you begin in. That's kind of bland. I already answered that with these two. Um, I would find an expert that has all this. I wouldn't need money because they would come to the table and I would be able to organically sell them likely through outreach and through some content and maybe run some small ad budgets and just grip and rip. I would just rip it from from nothing and go from there. Go back to the break. Go back to the breakdowns of your business. They seem more genuine than the random guess. Felt we were friends on those videos. Regardless, keep crushing it. Sorry. Yeah, I decided that I wanted I basically used the first 60 60 videos to build a network and to share, you know, spew a lot of things that were in my brain, what was happening now uh for us. And I still do that. Like today I'm going to do this Q&A. Um tomorrow I have a really good person I want to talk to that's all about another niche within info coaching and selling and exits and stuff like that. And the next day I'm going to do a month in review. Um, it's just it gets a little bit harder to do them every single day once I spew everything out and kind of feels like I'm just like yelling at the computer sometimes. And I don't know, the feedback loop's not super there, but I'm definitely going to continue to share things like as they're evolving and changing in life and in the business. That's what I've been doing. I literally just share what's happening now basically. Um, it was easier a little bit to do in the beginning because we were deep in marketing, so here's all the crazy marketing stuff. Then we were deep in sales, here's all the crazy sales stuff. Uh, now we're doing fulfillment and data stuff. And I'm sure I'm going to share all about our data restructuring and reporting systems and source of truth and automations and all that, but like I just share as we're doing it and we're obviously trying to move quickly so there's enough content to talk about things on a daily basis, but like it's heavy. It's heavy. So, what lean info business model have you seen that scales the hardest, runs with the fewest amount of people, and has the highest net rev employee, and has the long-term durability? What's the most badass one-man operation you've seen so far? Oh boy. Um, the most lean info business model I've seen was probably when I talked to Ahmed and they do the MR stuff and that's in make money online niche kind of, right? So, they're doing trading and stuff like that, but the model just inherently runs really lean, right? It's like community management and that's kind of it for the front layer and then some onetoone or like pre-recorded core stuff that's on the back. It actually flips the business model. Instead of having like done for you on the back that's high ticket, it's done for you as MR low on the front and then the learn how to do it do it yourself is or like done with you on the back that's high ticket which is very interesting. It flips. Um but they have insane high numbers for these. They have crazy margins. It's just nuts. So yeah. Um I would do that one. I mean I I don't play in that game so I have no idea but something that has that model where it's light like that. You want something that is community focused where because when you're saying that it's high, it's low team and high that is like no one to one. It's not that massive where it needs a huge overhead. It's it's lean. It's high ticket generally or mass volume low ticket and it's like community management an expert. That's kind of it, right? All the value is like inherently in there and then inside the community itself. Same thing with the high ticket like masterminds and groups. Those are, you know, they have high cost, too, I guess, but they have lean teams and very high revenues. So, uh, long-term durability, that's hard. I don't know. I don't necessarily know that I have an answer for you on this fully. What's the most badass oneman operation you've seen so far? Um, I don't think it's one man, but Peter Levelvels, I think it's how you say it. I followed that guy for like 15 years or whatever, 10 years, and I've he is no longer a oneman operation, but basically, I mean, he has crushed and done so many things building in public. He's a badass. Um, and he's more in like the development space or like developers, but he crushes. Uh, inside info, I don't know who's a one man that's gotten too far, nor do I think there really should be. I mean, you hear these guys say that there's going to be a oneman AI business that hits a billion dollars and like all the power to him. I just don't know that game well enough. So, you need some point of leverage. So, you need code, you need capital, you need something um that can scale in that way. Um, how would you structure a funnel and for a community plus live course that helps people get promoted in their specific role? Right now we structured as a free community, low ticket or free webinar and upsell to a boot camp. So that helps them get so I think you're talking about like for employment you're trying to help somebody who's sales man a sales rep learn how to become a sales manager I think is what you mean here. So right now you have a structured as a free community low ticket or a free webinar and then upsell to a boot camp. Um, depending, you could probably just go straight to the boot camp. I mean, yes, free is great, but first off, I would pick a niche. Um, and I would focus on it. So, in my example, you pick sales reps and then you go to sales managers. Um, versus, oh, it's like all middle management people that want to go to VPs or something like I feel like it just it's going to there's so many of whatever niche people that if you're the best of the best. I know a group that does it for a specific type of athlete that is very specific to a position and whatever and they [ __ ] crush crush like seven figures a month like cook. So they do a uh direct to group basically or like coaching style thing that has no free anything. Um they do like free guides and stuff for lead flow but that's it. And then they just sell direct so they don't have to manage a free community. They don't have to sell some little low ticket thing. A free webinar. Yes. So, I you could just even run free webinars to a lead list or get leads for a free webinar and then push them to this boot camp with the right process. I don't know what the ticket is or what, but like generally speaking that as long as you're selling the result. This whole thing goes back to that offer, right? As long as you have a good offer, which is, you know, again, Horoszy's book. I keep pointing over there because it's on that shelf. Um, but yeah, also it's 8:30 on a Friday. So, sorry if I'm uh I'm a little drowsing. How would you I'd love to hear about your process for handling no-show meetings. What does the sales rep do? What is the HubSpot workflow? What kind of success would you have rebooking no-shows? Um, so for us, these fire into a channel. So they have an automated email that goes out that's like, "Hey, you know, we missed you." Or like, "Where were you? Here's how you reschedule." And basically just send them that automation. Um, we have a for us it's no showcanc. They kind of trigger the same one. Um, which is different than a reschedule. Very important there. Um, but then we have them fire into a channel and then setters reach out to them and, you know, hammer them to try and get them back on the phone and figure out why they didn't make it, understand if they're still serious about it and then rebook them on the calendar. So, workflow is pretty simple. Just, you know, an email. Uh, we used to have an automated text that did it, but now we have actual people that do it, so it fires into a channel to notify them. And then what's our rebooking from no shows? Uh, it's pretty low, honestly. I mean, someone who doesn't show on that, if they don't come up with an excuse or a reason or whatever within x amount of hours, they're gone. And then we do have a ton of them that'll rebook themselves later through marketing assets, but we don't t spend too much time and like resources around hitting them. That'll probably change as the setter team grows to, you know, dial five a day. Go hard on it, but until then, nothing crazy on here. Know you're into info, but would love your insight. Agency is doing 20K a month in revenue. Nice. With 13K in profit. Nice. Seven clients. It Is it too early to hire an SDR offshore mostly commission and focus on building a scalable outbound sales team? Main bottleneck right now is just leads. We have backend. Yes. Yes. If your main bottleneck for growth is you just don't have inbound of clients, then yes, hire an SDR, it's any of the acquisition sources, it's paid ads, it's organic content, it's referrals, it's partnerships, it's whatever. It's all the things. It's outbound. It's like, you know, again, there going back to Horoszi, but read the leads book. Like there's a bucket of there's a lot of different ways to get clients. Find one that's predictable uh and scalable and consistent and hammer it and just have one. All you need is one and just have it as a steady flow that you know that you get 17 meetings a week and every week you have 17 of those and you know 10 of them show and four of them close or whatever your math is and you're good and the next bottleneck that'll break is the back end and then you fix that and then when you're ready for the front end to get bigger and your traffic source won't go any higher for whatever reason you have another one. ori had another video on this where they talked about it where it's like basically over a million a month is when you can start to talk about having multiple sources. But really what it's all about is just getting to a point where you have consistency and this consistency can scale to the level of what you can fulfill on and grow to. What are some of the best courses to take on paper call? Uh Adam Young has one on YouTube. It's a little outdated but not crazy. I mean it's still extremely valuable. Um where he goes through like 26 hours of the entire paper call industry so you have the understanding. He also has a book I have right here. The paper call revolution is a good one. Uh Carlos um Jr. has a uh course and community and all this kind of stuff. All for paper call. Um the LFG show on YouTube is um I'm forgetting the name, but those guys uh talk about all this kind of stuff. And there you'll find people who have them and there's a bunch of people. I mean it's a little closer held to the chest I think from my perspective, but there's plenty of people that do it. Um the one that I just did with Nate Anellet, he talks about doing brokering for paper call. So it's basically an understanding of paper call industry and then how to become a broker. Not so much like, you know, how to buy and set up landing pages and stuff. But yeah, you can find the guys just go to like LFG show, watch people on there, follow them on, you know, Instagram socials. Certain ones share certain things, certain ones have courses, some have masterminds, mentorship. Hi Ryan, can you make a video on the bless best places to find talent such as copy and creative? Obviously, P&L is a factor, but if you could break down the points at which getting top talent made an impact, where you found this talent at different P&L levels, hope this makes sense. Example, if you're at 30K a month, would what would you recommend for talent? If it's not this point, when does it become worth it? Um, all right, couple things here. So, for copy and creative, I would go in places that copy and creative people live. So, for example, a good one is nothing held back uh Facebook group. They have a job board. So, two different groups. One is like the community normal one, the other one is a job board. There are plenty of people that are all copywriters and creative um stuff on Georgie has a group those are you know more tactical like a like those guys crush and they have uh you know it's going to affect your P&L a little bit more but a lot of them will do retainer deal plus percent they'll do like a bunch of different stuff so it just depends on what caliber you're looking for but I would start there um the break points that when getting top talent made an impact is when you can't do it as well or your bandwidth isn't there hiring where it hurts. Um, so for us, we had a copywriter early. The co-founder was an extremely good uh copywriter, media buyer, all the things and spent for us up to like 20K a day. So that was kind of like a nonpoint for us. Um, but yeah, we definitely had creatives come in who did all the ads that was like Upwork style stuff. We had a copywriter that came in that did two emails a day and some scripting, but co-founder did a bunch of that. But yeah, if you need to find one, I would go in that group. And there's not a specific uh revenue threshold. It's more so when it becomes a bottleneck or when it hurts. So you'll know if you're not doing enough volume on creative and ads and stuff or you should know. And that's when you need to hire it over here. And then over here if you know you have too many leads but they're not closing. It's because your sales isn't good or because you don't have enough sales reps. If if you know they can't book out in two-day windows because you don't have enough volume or enough reps to handle the volume. So yeah, I would just think about it like that. What's the what's their point? When to acquire talent? I think that's probably the same person I would assume. But yeah, same thing. Hire when it hurts. We overhired and hired into the future a little too much. when there is a time and place for that when you're being proactive when the P&L can support it. But off the rip, I wouldn't. I would just hire where it hurts. I would try and do all the things. I would learn how it works and then I would try and find somebody who is amazing at it and then broker a deal that is, you know, paying them at market or above so you can keep them uh and have the P&L support it or break them into some sort of, you know, basically performance deal that scales with how they scale that's directly tied to what they do. So basically focused on you know an example of a sales manager that can come in and crush it can get a percentage of the revenue uh that they produce within their team and then you know they want to push it harder so they make more money and it's aligned. You want to make sure your per performances and bonus pools are in alignment with things that actually are growing the business so that you're not coming out of pocket more as you scale or in the wrong direction because of not their work and then you are losing you know profit dollars on that. So, when to acquire it though is just when it hurts. When you see that there's clear, when you see that, you know, there's a gap that's occurring or something continues to break or something's not optimized, you'll know and that's when you hire for it. I'm studying I'm starting a CRM and lead management agency focused on real estate. Nice. Mainly for uh for wholesalers and agents. I'm not into sales or cold calling, but I like the backend side. Systems tagging, lead routing, pipeline cleanup. Right now, I do W2 for a wholesale. I do this W2 for a wholesaler, but I want to build my own service business offering this to others. A few questions I'd love to take on. Do you think there's real demand for CRM and lead management without offering uh you're going to know that better than I am is there is if there's real demand for CRM and lead management without offering lead genen or cold calling. You know, you're getting them the result, right? You're not selling them the lead management. You're selling them what the lead management gets them. And if that includes cold calling and lead genen, then yes, you're going to likely need that. um it's a lot more difficult to sell like tech and infrastructure systems unless you can like reasonably say because you're you're not selling them that you're selling them the output same way that you're not selling AI to a company you're selling them what the AI does for the company what the automation does so you know if you need to find a partner that's either another company or a person or something that offers that part of the service and that makes your offer amazing then you need to do that is go high level worth the cost when starting out or is there a leaner way for full CRM it's probably the best way and definitely the most scalable I don't really mess with go high level just cuz I like my dedicated tools and that's just personal preference. I know people who crush with goh high level. I know people who have massively scaled it. I know some of the top affiliates for go high level. Uh I just never got into it. But I've definitely built instances in it and seen where you can have multiple people in it and sub accounts and all that stuff very easily. So it may help with your fulfillment and you can also charge them through the white label thing. So you can make more money as a recurring subscription, not just a one time or whatever offer. What are the bare essentials I should focus on to get the first two or three clients. Appreciate what you do. Been watching for a while. Um, I would use those case studies and results. So, build as much examples and resultbased stuff of what you've done with your current W2. That's like, you know, I built this lead management system and it took us it took the 10,000 leads we had and optimized it so we got five% of them that converted and like that's crazy because market average is 1%. or I built this automation that did automat that does follow-ups that gets a 62% response rate and industry average is 12 or like nobody even hits theirs or you're leaving $10,000 a month on the table inside your CRM because you don't have this automation like stuff like that and then I would reach out just direct to basically people that are like your employer and I'm not trying to diss on that and like I don't know your relationship but find other wholesalers. You either know them already or you can find them very easily in whatever group or LinkedIn or whatever that you can find them. find where they hang out and come to them with I can get you this result and then when selling them off the rip, you already have experience, so it shouldn't be that hard to offer money. Uh try and do some sale that's some ROI justification. You pay me five grand and I'll find you 15 or do some performance deal if it's just your time. If it's some time, then you're going to go, I'm going to build this out and we're going to take however many leads and on the tail end that come through my automations or the increase, I'm going to get X per deal or I'm going to get a percent or I'm going to get whatever. Um and I think that would be helpful. My wife's a dietitian and lactation consultant. Interesting. I don't know what that means. Uh, looking to launch a coaching program for women in pregnancy and early motherhood. That explains why I don't know what that means. Um, goal is to hit six figures without a huge client load. What would you recommend for packaging the offer, getting the first wave of high ticket clients? All right. So, she's a dietitian and lactation. I was kind of kidding. Uh, about consultant and wants to launch a coaching program. So, goal to hit six figures without a huge client load. Uh, six figures a year, I assume you mean, is only 10 grand a month. Um, which is not hard. So, that's two people at 5K a month. Uh, if your goal is that a month, you either need to be okay with a little bit more volume and be okay with 20 a month or whatever. Um, right. 20 a month. Yeah. Um, at 5K in the example. or you need to sell something that's higher ticket which means you need to target someone that is more affluent or this solves something that is absolutely revolutionary that people are willing to pay some top dollar even if they are not affluent. Uh what I mean by that is if you have some magic pill that helps them do XYZ in their pregnancy or early motherhood not actually a pill but like you know this crazy offer you will get people who pay you 25 grand. You will get people who pay you 50 grand. Um, and you can easily hit that if this is more of just kind of like a group or whatever coaching style thing with helpful whatever and it really changes them and like you can sell the benefits of the result being this changed experience in life and like major thing. There's like nothing more important than your health and your wellness and your family and like the people around you. And if framed correctly, that is actually a very easy to sell. Um, as long as you get the result and you're not scummy. So yeah, uh, I would package the offer. I would read that book. I keep talking about it, but read uh Hormosy's offers book and package something up that helps these women uh get the result and price it accordingly and then go after a market of those women, a niche of those women in whatever market that attend XYZ class or gym or this style or are in this type of employment or are self-employed or whatever that'll have the you know funds to do so depending on how you structure your offer. So, hope that was helpful. You can ask again in a little more detail. all my people to help and I wasn't being I was sorry I was being jokey. Uh what would you do about how or how would you go about acquiring clients for info products and coaching programs? I have a results and case studies but a poor acquisition system. Same thing I've said before. There's 92 there's a thousand different guys in info and coaching that have videos on this that are free. There's courses or case studies on how to get uh clients. There's organic, there's paid, there's partnerships, there's a there's all the things. Um, I just, yeah, I mean, that's what I would do is you need to learn how to have an acquisition system. I don't I don't know if you're trying to sell this and you don't know how to do it, which it would be inherently an issue if you're trying to sell an acquisition system and you don't know how to do it. Um, but yeah, this one is very prevalent. You can find a million people that'll talk about this on the internet for free and how to get clients and DM setters and all the things. There's like literally 92 different ways to do this consistently. Uh if you want to partner if you want to partner with an expert and build scale and optimize an info business, what do you think essential operator skills one should have to develop as someone who has never done it? You need to be the everything for everyone. You need to understand the business model better. You need to understand the math. You need to understand the people in the stack. You need to understand what's important and really the math um behind that. And then yeah, I mean you just got to get the boots off the ground right to start. You don't have to think about like oh what happens when we have 50 employees and how do I manage them be a good leader? uh that comes with time and you can develop that skill. The skill is consistency in each bucket. The skill is being able to know your numbers and get consistent acquisition, consistent fulfillment, consistent results flywheel that feed back into the marketing system, consistent sales if you're doing phone, you know, those pieces of the puzzle. Um there's contractors and agencies that do each piece of that puzzle, too, where you can like outsource and then just have a really good product. Like there's a lot of ways to look at it, but message me about this. Actually, DM me about this because I'm curious what you mean. Is the skill ceiling higher for info operators who scale with cold traffic versus those who rely solely on organic traffic? And how do the skill sets differ? Is the skill ceiling higher for info operators or who scale with cold traffic versus um that's a diff that's an interesting one. Um organic. So like me, it's a great example. So I don't have the organic skill. I don't fully know it. I understand this much of it and it's this big and even this much of it I joke of for my stuff I do this much of that right like I I get the 12point checklist and the product the packaging and the this and the that and like I just don't do any of that for my stuff and we haven't done that well in the business we just actually hired someone what's today Friday yesterday Thursday uh to do this on the main brand to give it a go um but the skill set is just different I don't want to say it's like higher or lower it's like one person who's really good at organic and can generate consistency around, you know, basically virality and get the right type of people to watch the content, get the right type of people to convert is a very good skill set and it also generally has a lower cost around it. Um, depending on how the content production and distribution is, but generally is going to be cheaper and have longer tail and deeper audience, easier close rates. The rest of the business model gets easier uh at some level than cold or than cold. Yeah. Which is like you're spending all the money. it can go all to a page that's broken and you can lose all the money in a day. You they're cold, right? So, it's not as easy to sell them on the phone. It's not as easy to get them to show up on the phone. It's not as easy to get to buy them something on a sales page. It's just not as easy. So, I guess I see what you mean by it being like a higher thing, but there's guys who crush at this and some guy in lead genen could come in and just rip it on cold traffic and, you know, assuming they understand the nurturing and the consumption model of info that is necessary to sell whatever you're selling could crush it for you. So, I think that answers your skill sets differ. Um, but yeah, mindset books, like half of these are mindset books and half of them are tactical. Um, I'll have to get back to you on this with like a full list, but like Psychocybernetics is a banger. That's one of my OG ones. Um, Magic of Thinking Big is a good one. Um, I have like the OG stack, like the the originals. So, those are the two that initially come to mind, which probably means something, but some of the newer age ones are actually pretty good, too. I don't know. I don't really like tactics around this. Um, I think books are great around here um for this. And then I also will say there's some banger mindset stuff that come from like Becker and Ovens and that are a little bit more specific to like you and your online business and how you live and how you think. Um they're the ones who you know brought to the newer age at least my bracket of age or understanding of where I was that was all around feedback loops and iteration and goal setting and not like affirmation but just kind of like framing your life living in identities transferring yourself into a future identity because that future person is the one who you know is at that goal. It's you have to change as a person to hit the goal, not the goal has to just, you know, happen. A lot of good stuff there. So, I would look up those. I think they have those actually free now online on YouTube. How do you guys how you guys your sales manager recruit rep? Oh, how do we recruit new reps? Um, so we'll do postings. Now that we're just known in the space, it's easy. So, now we just get inflow of them. We can post in groups. Again, nothing held back group is a great one. Um, there are guys that have, I'm forgetting the name of the software, but they have a whole software you pay like $400 for and then you get access to their entire pool and then as long as your offer hits this, this, and this, you're going to get a flood of applications. This is not really a hard one. There's just so many high ticket reps now. Um, there's what's her name? Uh, Shelby Sap. Like they have Shelby, Cole Gordon, like she has one that's like really all for females. Kohl's is not all for males, but mainly probably is. and like they have an entire system where they teach reps and or teach them how to be reps and then either sell them on the back or just you know make them available to the marketplace to do that. Um but yeah, we have recruited a bunch out ourselves. Our new sales manager has connections with a bunch that are coming in. Our old sales manager had a bunch that of connections that came in. We will post on some platforms sometimes, but like if you're looking for high ticket closers, there's a it's a it's like a unique part of it of the industry. It's not just like a sales rep who's like from manufacturing. It's like a high ticket remote sales rep. Like they know the gambit. They know the current situation versus desired situation and your yours solves that. They know like the script that's been passed around. So, I would try and find somebody that's already in the industry. Um, generally speaking, just, you know, watch your culture. Uh, financial modeling, ad campaigns, and your process for fixing bottlenecks and ads. Um, yeah, this is something I heard the other day was someone and I'm going to have one with uh the Alchemist Kid uh later this week and he's going to talk a lot a lot about this, I'm sure. Um, but yeah, I've heard you can completely dump all this and drop it into GPT nowadays. I haven't done this, but I've heard you can. Um, overall how I would look at this is like everything is a funnel, right? It's like if your click-through rates are ass, then you know, and your cost per click is this, but your optin rate, you know, you got to look down the funnel. It's like you can see within the different layers inside the ad manager what's happening and what's going wrong. You can see if clickthrough rates are not good. You can see if cost per clicks are out of whack. You can see if like these different things as you go down the thing down the chain from eyeball impression all the way down to purchase, you know, clickthrough rate, cost per click, landing page view, lead, app, booking, phone, like you can go all the way down the list and see them. Um I don't know. I don't know if that's a good answer for you, but yeah, there's a lot of this. There's also AI tools you can plug in. I was on a call with some like the eight figure or whatever it's called, the 8 figure uh info guys thing, and these guys were talking about how they use uh like that magix's AI tool uh for their ad accounts to set reminders and like find things inside the ad account. So, I heard that's a really good one, but yeah, I don't have a ton of experience on this. B2B SAS info product. I don't know that I know of that to be honest. B2B SAS to info. I know I've seen a lot of info products that try to go to SAS um or do already do this. Um but B2B SAS, I mean essentially generally that's like you're selling I don't know what you're selling. You're selling information on how to use the software. You're selling coaching on the back end of how to use the software, get the result. Like they're buying the SAS because usually what would happen is if they're be if they're buying the SAS, they're trying to get the result or use the tool to get the result, right? They're buying it for some reason in that way. an info product is then you know more of the same or the next problem that happens is once you get this result you have this issue and here's the information on how to solve that is kind of like how you'd look at it it's like what's the ascension ladder what's the chain in doing that and is it info or is it coaching is it onetoone is it group um is it completely personalized and done for you or is it you know do it yourself and just give them login access to a course I don't really know the context here with this much information but like yes it's doable I just can't think of an example couple more guys uh hey brother Rock, God bless. Thank you. Quick question about optimizing our funnel for conversion rates. We're running I love these. We're running an opt-in funnel VSSL to book a call and an opt-in. Okay, so it's opt-in VSSL app likely book a call for our e-commerce bisop offer. We're currently most of our bookings are from our setters calling optins or people responding to automated via text. Very few leads are self-scheduling through our survey to calendar flow. Interesting part is our best prospects are are the ones who complete everything. Of course, 100% because they have the highest intent. Here's what I'm wondering. Should we extend our current two-minute timer, which unlocks the survey that allows them to book to boost those self-induced booking self? No, not my opinion. I mean, test it, but or do we go back and fix the VSSL itself? How do you typically diagnose where the drop off is happening in a funnel like this? What's your process for identifying whether it's a timing issue versus a messaging offer problem looking to maximize? I love this question. Okay. So, if you have an opt-in funnel, then you are getting them as a lead. So, that's what you're saying is you're getting their name, email, phone number, and you are calling them and and then you're able to call them because they drop off. So, your VSSL is not doing its job. So, a lot of things that happen here. Once you get their name, email, phone number, you can call them, you can email them, you can text them, you can do all those things. They are landing on the VSSL and they are not making it to in this you said twominut timer, which is nothing. Ours is 18 minutes or whatever, 14 minutes or seven, like depending on the VSSL length. The CTA is like 80% of the way through the VSSL. We are then hammering them with emails because we don't even ask for phone number. We're then hammering them with emails. If you stay to the end of the VSSL, you get these bonuses. We're going to send them to you by email. We send everyone the bonuses by email. You're sending them an email immediately that says, "Hey, here's your training." You're sending them 25 minutes after saying, "Here are the bonuses for staying till the end." Even if they didn't stay to the end, you're then sending them another email another day later. Like you're doing that through email. So then they're going to come back and they're going to land on a page that's here are your bonuses. They're on the bottom of the page, your VSSL here, a testimonial wall that they scroll through and then the bonuses. Bonuses are free value that then ascend them into booking a call and applying. So that whole machine exists and then your VSSL just seemingly doesn't work because we still have a ton that come through direct. So they wait for that full 18 minutes. You need to get a tool for this portion. Where do you see where that drop drop off is happening? You need to see the VSSL stats. So you need to see the engagement rate, the drop off, the time of the VSSL, what the drop off is. So there's uh tools like, excuse me, there's tools like Vidalytics is what we use. I've heard there's a cheaper one that I don't use. It's like tid something. I don't know the name of it. Um you can ask around, but there's another one out there. Um but Vidalytics is what we use and it'll show you how many people click the play. It'll click show you where the drop off point like it's a chart like this. You'll see like and like how many stayed to the end, how many stayed to the CTA mark. You can do all that stuff. Um, but this is a VSSL issue. And then it's like if your beginning is like has this crazy drop off, it's like, okay, make three new leads and then all of a sudden you'll have one that goes to 30% over here and you're like, "Oh, that's the move." And then you change it to that one and your calls jump three times. Um, and yeah, so I'd focus on that. And then also the whole machine around it. If you're not emailing, texting, and doing all these things, if the VSSL isn't framed in a way that's to get them to stay to the end, if you're not offering a bunch of value with it or like why they should stay, like you got to optimize all of that whole piece of it. Um, but it sounds good that you're getting these and you're you're getting people to book and call even through text and stuff because they're clearly interested in whatever's on the opt-in page. They're in the result, the overarching thing that's in the training. So, you're you're on the right track 100%. I like this question a lot. Thank you. Appreciate the value you're dropping in your videos. I've been a closer for a couple different offers in B2C and B2B for two years. I used to run ads for an agency for local businesses. I've done well as a closer over 3 million collected. Nice. And I love sales, but I'm stuck at around 15 to 20K. I'm starting to burn out. Yeah, that's kind of the model is top closers like our models will make 30 or 40, but they are cranking if they're doing that. So like this is kind of par for the course. Uh want want more freedom to take the next career step. I'm wondering based on your view in the online what do you see as the next step for a sales rep? I'm considering either starting my own B2C info offer helping beginners get into sales or helping sellers closers make more money starting from my own sales agency or becoming a sales manager for an info offer. For context, my end goal is to build a business that gives me freedom. I enjoy running and getting into a $50 million network before 30. I'm 20. This is aggressive. This is a aggressive. So 50 million not not to say it's not a possibility. I know people who have done it for sure. But to do it through what vehicle is the better question here. And just doing it with like an info off or whatever, like you'd have to likely have an exit or you'd have to cash flow soing heavy and have very lax zone in order to do that in the next seven years. Um but like you can do it, anyone can do it. People have done it in one year. So like this is not a [ __ ] on that and I hope that's comes across right. Um of your three options starting a B2C info offer. A lot of people are doing this so you got to stand out of the crowd. Same with this. A lot of people are doing this. Starting on sales agency, a lot of people are doing this and yes, a lot of people are doing this. The beauty of this one is if you can bolt yourself into one that is scalable, that is has a plan of an exit that you can get equity in that you can do whatever you can get closer to this. The beauty of these is you have full control of everything and you like the sales agency for example. I know guys that are doing hundreds of thousands a month. Um I don't think I know directly anyone who's doing over a million a month with this model. Um but that it cranks you know you take 20% of someone's sales, you take 25% of someone's sales uh of their company and you run everything. You have sales management, you have closers, you have setter management, you have setters um and you just run that full thing. So, I mean, you have the experience, but you need to get more reps in any of these to like scale to any of these kind of numbers, which is everyone. That's life. So, starting your own offer could be cool um for B TOC. Uh this one is more mass market, so you could ramp it. It's going to take more marketing skills than it is sales skills in my opinion because you need to get in front of enough eyeballs to do enough volume uh to be able to sell something like this to get to a million, five million, 10 million a year. Um and then you know to get to these numbers you need to be at hundreds of millions over the next seven years which is again doable. Um but yeah so sales manager one is probably the next natural iteration where you could do that if you have no uh no no experience managing. It's going to be hard to go enter into somewhere as a manager. Uh especially like an experience like without the experience of managing people. Um it's going to be easier to grow as a sales rep into a manager in the company you're in. Um the sales agency one a lot of people are doing that. You can give it a go and just see how much you can scale it. see if you can get pieces of people's companies, see if you can get, you know, the rev share model is real. It's just you only make a spread because then you have to hire your team and manage it and you make your three, five, 10, whatever percent uh once you have economies of scale. So, hope that makes sense. Hopefully that was helpful. Um, you're crushing it, dude. I mean, you're 23, you're you're making, you know, 250 grand a year. I mean, there's a lot of options for you. There's a lot of options for you. So, for the next Q&A, this is the next Q&A. uh have been running organic YouTube and it's been slow as YouTube is typical for the as YouTube typically is for the past 12 to 18 months. One two high ticket high ticket clients a month and a month or two without any finance funding travel offer. Interesting. Looking to run ads for the for it to generate more lead flow and app bats but don't want to go crazy on spend as it's a lean team essentially solo operations. It possibly get a good idea to also run ads to a digital product. If so, how would you set that up? direct to cart with long funnel copy or even a VSSL explained digital product and then for those that purchase having them also join a free community where you can nurture them further on live calls thinking this through I feel a good idea to work on both with ads and not only to grab data but to have more people in the free community to eventually sell them later on high ticket what are your thought process on the situation all right so you're talking about a lot of things here you're talking about having a low ticket product talking about having a free community that they get in which is actually a paid community because you're having them pay for it you're talking about having a free community standalone and you're talking about selling high ticket and you're talking about doing it from organic and you're talking about doing it from paid. So organic must not be working at the scale or the offer isn't good enough because I don't know you got to we have to see the funnel here. So if you're getting a thousand clicks from your organic a month and you're getting no units or no sales it's like it's not a good acquisitions like you you don't have enough flow out of a thousand clicks you should be converting higher like somewhere in the chain is broken and I need more data on that part of it. Uh ads are going to be quicker but yes they have a cost. Running to high ticket you're going to get a quicker higher return in my opinion unless you have something you know how to do this low ticket piece. The other way is running a organic to a free community could totally be a move and all you're doing is funneling them into there for XYZ results or to be in there for XYZ reason. And then from there you can nurture them you can set them. You can provide value and you can only do CTAs inside your free community for your paid stuff or to book a call or to get XYZ result. And then your organic just acts as getting them into the free. And then the free just acts as getting them into the high ticket or the paid. So I would do that. Uh I don't know that you need to I I don't know the funnel math. I don't know the count of clicks and the count of views and the stuff you're getting right now. Um but it sounds like you have like the right idea. Um this is just my opinion, but yeah, direct to cart with long funnel copy is generally speaking hard. Um and especially hard if you don't have the backend system built to where you know how to ascend them up or like get them from the community. So if you already have a community, learn how to nurture and pull people from the community that 3% of the people in the community ascend to your high ticket or whatever and then work on getting flow of consistency from organic into free community and then that free community upselled into paid. Like that's a very classic funnel. That's horos you know that's a big portion of how they do it at school is free community to paid community or free community to high ticket you know group which has a community stuff like that. So I hope that was helpful but I don't really know what this offer is either. That's kind of finance funding and travel. I don't really know what that is, but simple, easy setup for running ads to an offer. Simplest funnel uh is going to be a DTA funnel. H that's maybe not true that we'll use that is going to be a headline, a VSSL, and an application. They apply, book a call, and get on the phone with you. It's the easiest one. Uh the hardest part of that is going to be the VSSL portion and that's, you know, kind of it and then obviously the sales call. But you get a lot of feedback. You can talk to people. you can understand, you know, how they got there, the flow on a phone that you won't be able to get if you send them to a sales page because all you're going to do is see a heat map of them clicking around and doing their thing and like that's it. So, I think that's probably the easiest one. And then, yeah, all back to the offer. Biggest thing here is the offer. You could have the ugliest page, the ugliest funnel, the worst converting one. You could have a funnel that doesn't work and that people have to send you an email or send you a postcard in the mail in order to purchase. And if your offer is good enough, you will have thousands of postcards. So, focus on the offer and then back into a very simple funnel. I have explanations of all of our funnels and a bunch of other people have million of these. Cole Gordon just dropped a really good video talking about this where he walks through the different funnels they've used with, you know, um, free posting and like community stuff to high ticket or like uh, VSSL opt-in funnels to all that. So, yeah, hopefully that was helpful. 58 minutes almost on the hour daily update. Today was day 79 in a row of doing these videos. Uh, you can see them all here. www. Got to use that because I broke clickfunnels. Uh,.comdoc. It's a notion board. You can sort by tech, marketing, sales, ops, mindset, all the things. See all the videos that fall into that bucket. I've been doing interviews with some people that I've now met through this. And those replace some of the daily videos of just these info Q&A funnel build style ones. And yeah, guys, we just hit 75 million today. So, get that third disc. so I can finally be fancy. There's really no ego, no flex is like I literally have friends that have like five times this and I'm a little fish, but it's nice meeting everyone and being able to provide some value. And I really hope you got like a nugget out of here, thought of something in a different way. Sorry, I'm a little exhausted. It's 900 p.m. on a Friday, kicking off the weekend strong and I have a 400 a.m. tomorrow with William Brown. So you guys will see that tomorrow for episode 80. I will talk to you guys soon. submit to this box for next week's right here request. It's a type form. You just fill it out and it'll funnel into here and then I'll be able to answer for next weekend. So, I appreciate you guys. Reach out on uh Instagram is usually the best or X for communication. And I hope you guys have a stellar weekend and week ahead.

# The $30M/yr Info/Coaching Business You’ve Never Heard Of (Tan Gera) | EP77
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rK7D3sUVvM

What's up, guys? All right, on today's video, we are 77 days into doing this, and we've got Tan Gira. Jira, how do you say that? Gira. I'll let him share who he is, but he was one of the first person to reach out to me when I started doing some of his content and connect with some killers that I did not know existed. Um, so he's been extremely instrumental in helping with things for talent for us, different things around the funnel structure. But I'll let him kick it off. So, Tan, who are you? Well, uh, Tanganger, French guy, born in the suburbs, eventually made out, right? Made it out of the suburbs. Uh, Indian descent. I lived in a few countries, ex-wall street banker. That's not often, you know, uh, the case in our industry. And eventually, I saw the light. I was like, I'm just a slave right now. And I saw behind the curtains of, you know, what's actually happening happening in the banking industry. And I got very hooked into crypto. Uh did very well with my own investments, created a network, met my co-founder, Salem, and we were like, you know what? I think people need this. People need education. Uh there's a lot of scams and all these things out there. So we launched 3 years ago, tight-knit community kept getting bigger. Yeah. Uh many things happen, right? They tried to cancel us, etc. But we made it this far, so we're doing well. It's cool. Decentralized is the company. Yeah, I was going to say, so let's go into that real quick. So you guys are how what do you categorize that? So it's info, coaching, education. What's the info coaching? Uh coaching. I don't like coaching here because it's more like hands-on deep mentorship. You know, the difference between like a product like ours markets run every single day and what was true yesterday isn't true today, right? So you need that constant flow of information to know what's happening in the market, have a system, have a strategy. And what we did is we took my CFA, you know, um, charter experience, all the strategies that are used in Tradfi and we brought it to crypto, which was never the case. In crypto, you only had those DJens, right? Yeah. Uh, that just trade without any strategy. We created our own. Um, I did well with it and now we teach it. Interesting. Okay, cool. Yeah, cuz I looked into you guys after you first reached out to me and it seems that you're definitely the I don't know the right word, but like boutique uh very educationbased, very like in that direction versus kind of the market and I only know this world like so well, right? I mean, I've bought it for, you know, a lot of years and just held it and lost and won and done my thing, but I've never like deep delved into trading strategies or what to hold or when to set like nothing. And so, um, you guys do what? It's around everything. Is it main? Is it just big cap? Is it just this? Is it active day trading? Is it like We do everything. We cover the whole spectrum of digital assets. I'm not even going to say crypto because now the scope is much bigger, right? Our name is decentralized masters. It's not crypto masters. Yeah. Why? Because we knew at least we bet on the fact that everything was going to go decentralized and onchain. It was going to be a whole decade of transition which I think we're in the middle of right now. Yeah. Like I started in 2016 first. So for me it's already been nine years and yet we're still early you know. Yeah. So we just had this belief once you have this core belief that everything's going to go there you just want to stick to it. And so what we do is three-step. One is deep uh video training where we show how like where to click what to do right on our strategy. We educate people. So it's like building a portfolio, the right allocations based on your risk profile, who you are as an investor because in investment there is no oneizefits-all. Yeah. Yeah. So we literally take what some wealth managers do and we apply that to our members like they go through a lot of understanding of who they are and what they need. Uh what level of risk they can take on and based on that they get like um tailored like allocations on how they could approach the market. Of course it's up to them. So that's the first thing right the planning. If you don't have a plan you're going to fail. Then the second part is as I said every day it changes. Every day there's something happening and so like you know Trump comes in with tariffs. How does that impact my strategy? It does. So you have hands-on mentorship and we had to go and find the best of the best out there and that's tough because they're they're making a killing with crypto themselves. Yeah. But what we figured is that there's a lot of them that value two things. One is having a community and shared resources of people who do the same thing to have b bounce off ideas, right? And the second thing is they just I mean crypto is lonely, right? So they just want to be part of like something bigger. They want to understand the vision and uh they help they they help our members because they love this and they want to pass it on. They want to teach it. Yeah. So let's get into that portion. So fulfillment because I was curious about that. So it's community groupish kind of coaching or is it I mean you don't have to go into exact like cost and pricing and everything but is is that the general offer stack so it's like they get access to a community it's groupish coaching obviously you just said there's how and like implementation stuff which I would imagine is done through like pre-recorded like what's the what's the structure of that three-step right video training step by step second is like one-on-one mentorship or group mentorship depending on what tier you're getting at because there are different tiers Some people want more hands-on support, some people want less. Uh, and then the third aspect, which is super important, is community. So, we have a massive community of like 3,000 plus members who are all very high profile, right? We don't take any anyone um who needs credit, etc. We we don't accept that because crypto is risky in a certain way and we don't want anyone to take an amount of risk that they can't withstand, right? So we just we have to pay more to acquire customers, but they stick because they have the means to do it. They have the willingness to do it. And so we can't just take anyone's money. We can't. Yeah. 3,000 members is no joke. What's the What's the stack? Where do you guys put them right now? Or like where do they live? Uh we circle circle community. Do you? Yeah. Okay. You'd think I mean that's hilarious. I I talked to everyone about all these. It's I mean it's school, it's circle, it's [ __ ] it's depending on your industry, maybe even like Discord, it's like you know there's all these different ones. I mean doesn't doesn't everyone hang out on Discord still or is that dead for the level of sophistication of our market and the investors we have? Discord is not the right place. Discord is for web three native young dudes, right, who understand what crypto is and like all this world like the Telegram and Discord stock is for crypto natives. But our our customer base is not that. So for them, you know, even probably Facebook group would have made sense, but they didn't have the enough functionalities, but that's where they live. Interesting. Okay. So you have the older yours is older demo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's super nice. And then so you don't do any financing and then we'll break into some fun stuff. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. We rolled the first time we did it was last year. We had never done it either and we just did like the internal version of like pay plans and stuff which is like kind of financing but not really like no actual credit plans. Never. You you what? We almost never do payment plans. That's crazy. And you guys are I don't know if you want to talk numbers, but you guys are 10 20 50 or like in those bigger numbers, right? You're not sub 10K. Uh you mean by price point? Yeah. We're very high ticket. Yeah. That's awesome. That's so fun cuz then you're I mean you already said it, but like the sticky and the quality and all of that. Like yes, you have to bite it a little bit on customer acquisition costs, but like if they stay for a while and they're actually legit and it's like a true bread community, it's like I just saw you pop into that one chat, they use WhatsApp and they're in there and it's like it's kind of hard to navigate. But that's the same thing. It's like I bet that churn is going to be so low because it's just like high quality people that are, you know, we're going to an event for it. Like those guys are killers and they all like just want to hang together and are willing to pay to play. It's so funny because like that example you can just like you could have just put everyone in a group chat but because there was someone who centralized it and put all the stuff around it it like it bodess the higher ticket right no I mean the you know coming back to your question about circle is it great no we'd rather have our own like app we're working on it uh we're going on software as we speak right and we eventually want to bring everything there. Yeah. But does it do the job for now? Yeah. Yeah. So, you haven't said, but the reason you stuck out to me is your numbers. So, do you talk about what you guys did last year or anything like that? Yeah, we did 30 last year. Yeah. So, we did 32 and I had literally had no idea you guys existed. And that's my own ignorance. And also because I think you guys are so high ticket that doesn't require as much necessarily volume. So, even if you're crushing it, hitting those numbers, it doesn't it doesn't require as much as many eyes on it, right? You don't need as many impressions to get that kind of when when your model works out to how you guys do for monetization. That's Yeah. So, like what happens with because last year I'm trying to remember last year was hot, right? Last year was in for your market. It was new all-time highs. It was all that. Like does it follow that trend? We just hit three months where no one was talking about it at all or whatever it was or they were but just negatively. Like how does that work? Uh it's funny you ask. I computed and it's very unfortunate. It tells you a lot about market psychology. So I computed a bitcoin uh average price performance like chart and then I tried to compare it with our enrollments right. Yeah. And there is correlation and it's because you know what when it drops is the best moment to get in and all these people that get in at this moment and when our because what happens then is you want to tell your membership directors right your the people who gatekeep and enroll. You want to tell them, "Guys, now it's now where you have to convince them because they're gonna have like everyone's gonna make a killing because the overall market is good, right?" Uh, but these people especially, so now is the time like push, but you also don't want to push. So, it's it's a battle. Yeah, that's interesting. I think about that that like, you know, your interest levels are down, but it's truly best buying opportunity or, you know, should be the best at least, you know, fundamentally should be. That's interesting. I would Yeah, I wouldn't think about it like that. So, you guys run what like what funnel stack? I mean, do you do I don't think I've seen low ticket stuff. I I know we kind of brief talked about that, but you guys do VSSL funnel classics, you guys do webinars, you do groups, like what's your play? We do um Okay. 99% of our revenue has come from VSSL, but we've seen uh that a few times just changing your way of approaching people can work. And so we've done a couple webinars here and there, but it's very specific, right? If there's something very special we want to talk about, there's the date, there is a FOMC meeting where we know there's going to have an impact and we know that people are going to be thankful that we did it because they came through this, they're going to get the results. We're like, "All right, let's do it." But otherwise, we like the evergreen type because we're very focused on the back end, like the retention and the software play. Not as much as like we don't need such a big acquisition like you know uh push all the time because our retention rate is insane. Like people just stay. It's like insane. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. When when you and I started first talking that was one of the first things that I was like oh yeah that's like a leaky bucket situation that we have for sure. Like we're on the hamster wheel of acquisition, but when it crushes like it just feel it's just the dopamine hit of just like inflow inflow inflow and you don't even for us like we didn't even I didn't even have dashboards. I wasn't even tracking the back numbers like I saw them and I knew they were happening but like not at the level nowhere near the level 5% of the level I did with the front end metrics. So I'll I'll tell you something funny like you know during this whole Trump situation what happened is the fear and greed index in the overall market went to as low as four out of 100. And I'm not talking the crypto if you're in greed like I'm talking about overall market sentiment. Right. And so people just didn't want to buy anything and especially not an investment high ticket product. Yeah. Right. So of course our front end suffered but because our back end is so strong and like customers just renew and renew and renew and keep renewing. uh most competitors in crypto office either got wiped out or just paused their ads and they were like let's wait and we were fine. Yeah. And that's the moat that we built because we started before anyone else like in the market we're literally I think the longest standing by far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, once I looked I mean once we started talking I looked into the guys I remember doing this that would do the pretty aggressive VSSL like not compliant in the slightest VSSLs but they were like pretty sizable. It's not like they were like some ClickBank offer and you know no [ __ ] on them but like they were a legit OP but they were going so hard on DR like so hard um that I don't know I don't necessarily see out of your guys' stuff like of course you have direct response but not at the level that's like that. And then you said something earlier. You said the how did you frame it? The like it's lonely. So do you see that you get referrals that you do get that stuff or because they don't know anyone in their space? This is where they come to it more so than like they're around the water cooler and it makes sense to refer somebody into the community. So we've had this discussion with so many members and they all say look like I referred but I gave so many disclaimers myself because look for this kind of demo right they made the choice to get in and often time what happens is they brag around with their friends you know playing golf or something saying hey I made the move I went into crypto etc and they get asked a lot of questions right on how how did you learn about all that and it's because They're part of our community. Yeah. But they always say, "Look, like I'm always hesitant because what if I tell them to join and tomorrow they don't apply what you guys teach and they get crushed? It's going to be on me." So, we do have referrals. It's like 10% of our revenue, which is fine, right? Fine. Yeah, that's great. No, it's fine. But we didn't really push on that because we just got that resistance of people saying, "Look, and I'm being very honest, right? Like they say, I love you guys. I'm going to renew, but I just don't want to put myself in a situation where if it doesn't work for someone else, then I'm like, "Yeah, sure. Cool." Because it's crypto, right? Yeah. No, no. I mean, I get it. Ours is when do you do it? Is the biggest question for us because it's like, okay, if you're trying to get a referral on the way in, which is like a very common practice for a lot of people. It's like, oh, you know, just get in like now who are your three friends you want to refer cuz you're in the high of joining. But like are, you know, with the transformation and very focused around the transformation and why they're buying it for the result. It's like the only frame you can use that really works in our my opinion and probably completely wrong for other people, but like is you're getting accountability, buddy. You're getting someone to be like in the trenches with you and do it with you because you have no result. You have no, you know, you're buying some future thing that you have not achieved. So like the only way you're going to do that is to bring someone with you. And then the other one is systematizing whatever you want to call it the feedback loop of like NPS or like uh testimonial or something that on the tail of that it's like oh they had this win oh they hit XYZ result or portion of the results on the journey now try and trigger them to get reviews or either reviews or referrals and we still haven't mastered it like what's your first win your path to first win for us? Yeah. It's that's the thing it's not standardized like we're doing a whole new data thing like we have MPS we have these different like we have different structured of setup of when we get feedback in the beginning heavily right for like those initial activations so those have a ton of feedback on them and then they do get routed based on where they land with NPS where they land with some of the check boxes like what bucket they sit in and that crushes but for it's a whole process right because it's like identify who they are first so like that should do that that they got the win the next piece is like what is the literal communication method or what is the offer that they can then push. So is it, you know, if you get three people, you get yours free. Do you get an extension on it? Do you get literal cash? Do you get like, you know, what is the offer that someone gets for referring someone or is there no offer? It's just they literally love it so much they feel like they cuz that's the dream state, right? Is like someone is like so over the top about this that they just like refer someone with no comp or no offer. But you're going to make an offer. So for us, I think it's right now the one that they're testing is three for free. So it's basically you get like you know whatever that is four months for free and an extension on top of your thing for every person you refer that pays. Um and then from there in fit because in fitness look typically so do you know uh you probably know Dan Martell right? Yeah. So there's this book software as a service and yeah you probably have it right it's good and because you know we're in software so I was reading it and what I liked is when they talk about optimizing everything for the first win. So for a software it can be like that one activation point whatever that is for you guys it could be lost 1 kg anyone once you lost 1 kg just post a picture and that's the you know the first step if they do that everything else will be easier right the one thing for us u what we've seen is that people start either you have some big money gamblers that start with like a million right up front and you our mentors are like yo yo yo chill chill chill you know and you have like um some other people who start small which we recommend and so it's very difficult to standardize. So what we had to do is we we we broke down the program into steps. Our step three is what we call our once you finish our step three, it's called the first win and there's always a quiz to pass it to open up the step four and so we can see right we calculate how long it takes them to finish step one, how long it takes them to finish step two and we keep incentivizing the team on being on literally on their ass like calling them to make sure that that time is like you know um less and less and less and we get to the step three as fast as possible because we know that if they finish step three within the first 30 days, they're going to renew. And the step three is what is like getting their whole portfolio set up and getting a first passive income stream running for them with profits coming in. Yeah. And so we know if they do that in 30 days, there's no chance they're not going to stay because they see it happening. They see the money coming in. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be what amount. It's just the action of it. The action of it. Yeah. when you you seriously were the one who opened my mind directly to like just even around the data around this or like your guys' back end and I was we started to dive into it and I think I talked to you but we hired a company to come in and basically do like all the data fulfillment automation restructure of all of that starting with product because we have so many client wins that come in. And we have so many people that like we basically tear it like there's internal so there's like reviews. So reviews the the top creme de creme or let's flip it on its side is the other the the one that has the most volume is like a textbased review. So someone drops it in either communication with the coach they drop it in the Facebook group they drop somewhere those get captured. That's the highest one. The next one is like before and after photo right and basically just like results there. And that one's a little less but still a ton of them. There are so many of those. And then the next tier is the selfie video testimonial style where they Yeah, I do too. And right and those have shown to be the highest performer for like someone who's in the middle or kind of colder. And then the next one and the highest one is an interview. So we do a onetoone interview with brand expert or brand face of company and those people and they like line up out the door to try and get an interview and do that. And they do like a long form 45 minute one of these like where were you stuck, what happened and those the one when those get consumed it's like you got a buyer in two seconds, right? So that's like our tier of those and how we trigger those is just this mess. But we get so many of them that they just fill this like client wins channel we have. We're like grabbing this one, trying to pull this one. I'm doing like batch uploads. Like there's not a system around it. So in the next iteration on what we're building now is like how do we structure that? What are those activation points or whatever you want to call them? When we do that, what actions do we want to take? So is it get a testimonial review or is it get a referral or is it what? And then I don't have the numbers to tell you like, oh, if someone submits a client wins thing or they submit this, how likely are they to renew? Like I don't know those numbers, which is crazy. But like that is the total direction that we're headed because now it's like if we can do this round fulfillment, we don't have to be we're always going to be some crazy direct response acquisition machine. We always will be. It's like just in our blood. But if we can keep them and do that, it's like, you know, that's that's fire and gasoline. You see, it's funny because uh it really depends on who you are as an entrepreneur, I guess. Uh it's true because I come from you know the the corporate like environment and so I've seen all these things like everything is structured even to the point where I get very pissed when my team uh doesn't doesn't have a proper naming convention on files or ads or you know and I teach them because in the banks I mean we would get hammered if we we you know didn't do that right because it's normal I I'm part of a 10,000 employee organization So I brought that and my co-founder, he's more direct response. He scaled big ecom stores like big big numbers. And so it's really about what you care about, what you've learned. Like that's that's the thing. Yeah. What's your guys' What's your guys' dynamic? So you're then more structure tech, but like are you both expert? Is one the ads and one's not? Like I don't know your guys' dynamic. We've been very agile. Very agile. uh when we started he took on marketing I took on sales we we understood that you know it's a whole new thing you have to sell on the phone and so I took the first 50 uh enrollments myself and then we brought someone in so we delegated sales I became manager so I had to learn first sales then because my background is investments right and finance then I had to learn sales sales management then I went back to fulfillment to fix it, right? Once it got big enough that it's the the focus and we have to update everything from fulfillment, I went to um more like how to become a better manager and leader. Been working on that a lot and now I'm back to marketing with him. Interesting. Now only now because we need innovation. It's it's that time, you know. Yeah. But also I built the uh renewal engine. Yeah. How do how do we do that? That's the thing that I I built from the ground up. Yeah. We're talking about hiring for that. Like we exact same situation is what you just said is like we literally were doing the sales calls, then we were managing a sales team and onboarding them all. Then we were, you know, like up the we can go on forever, but now the newest thing was like we need seale and like proper management of marketing. We solved for that, but then you have the ramping period and like catch up and where is everything and how do you guys do it versus how do we want to do it and where's the line and like all that stuff. Got that then it was sales. It's still sales but now I'm like I'm teed up and I'm like all right it's fulfillment but within fulfillment the issue the initial piece is it doesn't have the data. So building all that getting the data structured getting the automations getting the fulfillment standard like in all those ways that then we can iterate on the kind of inbetweener which is the retention and like continuation of that that that renewal engine but that's super interesting. So you guys said you have so the the monetization models are recur I mean you have recurring community access info all that but then you also have software you said yeah we literally just launched that uh and it's funny it's one of our top members who sent us an email one day um literally one year into you know the business and it has scaled and I get this email that says hey I'm an ex uh lawyer and my focus was estate planning. And by the way, hats off to you guys. You helped me make a lot of money in crypto. But what if I die tomorrow? That's the email by a member. And as I told you, our demo is like older. Yeah. I was like, "Holy [ __ ] I didn't think about that." You know, and so what happens is we kind of ignore it because we're scaling the business. We have a million things to do. I'm like miles away from thinking about that. But then eventually when you remove yourself from everywhere, everything's working well, your members are happy, you're like, "Okay, what's the next problem?" Go back to the parking lot of ideas. Yeah. And and what one day I remember there's a meeting of my renewal team that actually talks to people all the time, all the members, and they say literally it comes up on 50% of those calls. Like they're saying, "Hey, but what if something happens to me? how do I pass it on to my legacy to my hairs and so we're like all right let's do it and so we built I mean we looked at the market what's happening is there anything good out there they might be a couple solutions but they're not great and they definitely don't have the distribution they don't have that we have they don't have the user uh the customer you know the user base so is it so it's built internal so so no or you're trying to make it standalone It's standalone product because initially Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be um driven by, you know, the info and so our existing member base, but eventually it will be um public. So, we hired separately. We just did it on the side. Nice. Yeah. Uh Brooke who I talked to on here whatever x amount of days ago he they built one and it basically is it does he says it basically can't stand alone right now but it still pumps out six month six uh figures and be and like they're not going to leave right it's sticky. It does all these things except for the fact that like it doesn't really stand alone in itself. So the only acquisition for it is from his customers which still works. It's just like another monetization model. It just is like he he was basically saying it wouldn't be a standalone. But you guys are building this thing full on to be standalone. Yeah, because look um you know we started this business, we had money already thanks to our investments. He was he did great in business. I did great with my investments. And so we built the business a bit differently. We had this whole vision in mind before we started. And so that's why we went very very quick into like building the fulfillment machine because there was always that play at the end. The only thing we didn't know was okay we knew that we were going to solve the first problem that is education now in the crypto market but we understand the adoption curve and we understood that eventually it's going to go mainstream and so when it goes mainstream what is going to be the next problem to solve either you've helped people make a lot of money they understand it and now they're willing to let you manage it so one avenue was an investment fund and all my background is there right so I could do that or the other avenue is software and valuation game because if you want to reach exactly in the valuation game yeah I mean let's be honest like I I I would like to be a billionaire right and so to do that you have four sources of you know the four seas of leverage content we're using it with decentralized masters we're gathering eyeballs with content and then we're giving them content as well uh collaboration. So workforce, we have a massive workforce. I think less than you, but we are like 90. That's a flex. That's a good thing. Oh, I know. Do the math, everyone. If we're doing the same amount and he has less team and then you have the two missing pieces, code and capital. The beautiful thing that we realized and why we went for the software instead is our whole product is centered around capital. It doesn't have to be our capital. Mhm. Our members have the capital. It's in the billions. Our member base, right? So, if we build with code that is within the investment like area. Yeah. I know you're in a honeypot. What? So, I don't know if you want to go deep into like what the software is or the idea behind it, but like either that or what other monetization plays are even on the board cuz you said it was like software or a fund or c in that way, but like how big can this thing go or is that the goal of it? Oh, massive. We're I mean our goal, our big hairy ass goal or I don't know how you call it is uh the top 10 crypto companies in the world and we want to be the one everything app where people get in they see their whole portfolio they can buy there they can ensure their whole holdings there right the legacy because if something happens to them boom it goes straight to you know it's called proof of debt, etc. Yeah. And then it goes to their kids or whoever. Um, no lawyers, no third party, no middleman, etc. And they can invest in a fund right there as well. They have an AI assistant that tells them, "Hey, your holdings are not like what was supposed to be in your investment plan. Are you sure you want to, you know, buy this memecoin?" Yes, I am. Um, yeah. No, that's interesting. So, you got, so that's the goal is to do all those eventually, but like, you know, stairst step your way through. It's info coaching right now, whatever you want to whatever bracket you want to call it. It's software as this next play that can be serviced for or that acquisition is done through client base but can be standalone and then get its own inflows as its own standalone thing and then in addition potentially some version of fund or like capital management that occurs on the tail. You basically flipped the model on its head, right? Like for ages Silicon Valley was let's give like 50 million to this kid and let's see where he you know where where he lands. And the new model is you build an audience, you build a community, you give them tremendous value so that they trust you and then you serve them the product that they ask you and literally that product it's our customers who asked it like they said can you build this? We're like all right let's do it. Now the the the legacy part of it right like u the insurance part of it is just the way to after reading that book software as a service we realized it's the way to eliminate churn because no one knows by definition when they're going to die. Yeah. So they wouldn't cancel that subscription but then that's crazy. Yeah. I mean I get it. Yeah. But then you don't retain them that way. You want to expand that revenue. Right. How do you do that is by giving them like addictive services allin-one and where it gets magical because some people might say what happens in the bare market that is coming you know cryptocycles etc. Well, today digital assets, it's not only crypto. You can buy gold, tokenized gold, you can buy tokenized real estate, you can buy tokenized stocks, you can buy tokenized bonds. And so what we want to do is we want to bring all investment vehicles in under one platform. And you don't have Robin Hood account and then a brokerage here and then everything in one place tokenized. Interesting. Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, I I'm not privy on a lot of this, right? Like, I I understand I hear the things and what's early and what's actually in adoption and what, you know, adoption to us looks like versus what it actually looks like in the real like world versus our little pocket of internet marketing or crypto guys or whatever. Like, that's it. So, I think of Luca, right? And my example of like someone who took this kind of up the ladder of how far you can take something and his plans are always just crazy. and you know, I haven't talked to him in whatever couple months, so I'm not sure where he's at with it, but like he went from community info, whatever you want to call it, group uh about this to then buying NFT collection to then, you know, tokenizing it to doing the million things he did where he then brought it to physical products. He did all that and then next iteration is like has his own chain, right? Uh what did you know do you guys see yourself because right now that's it's not necessarily like you know the axes and shovel or whatever they call it like where you're just doing it like around the industry but kind of right it's like a little it's kind of so do you have any goals of anything that's specific to crypto itself like you guys have your own cuz right there like I I'm viewing this kind of and tell me I'm completely wrong because I can be but I'm viewing it right now where you're trying to build it around like things that already exist and you're bringing them together. you're adding on service layers or software as a service layers to things that already exist and kind of like supporting around it versus maybe being like XYZ utility actual coin or chain or whatever or XYZ you know I don't know the game well enough so I'm just trying to I'm just curious but uh I wouldn't discard it completely but I also wouldn't say that it's a focus because here's the thing I wouldn't want to build a token just for the sake of building a token Yeah, agreed. If I don't understand myself what value would have and bring, there's no point. Yeah. No, no, completely agreed. But it's interesting. You see the guys do it. You see the guys that I mean and it's all shortsighted. So obviously good that you guys haven't in order to just make it whatever a million bucks or three or whatever. It's like for what? Yeah. So I I want to go against that, right? I know that I'm going to be in the game of business for a very very long time. And so my reputation is everything. I'd rather just say no to short-term cash and like build confidence in what we do, who we are for a long long time. And I know that someday we'll reap the rewards. Look at Trump. The guy is a billionaire, right? And at 70 what? Six he becomes a president and then suddenly makes billions in like a few hours. Yeah. Yeah, I'm still pissed about that still. I'm still to this moment extremely annoyed by that. I was literally on my computer sitting there when it was at 900 and was like, "Oh no, it looks fake." And I just sat there and just watched it climb. Just watched it climb. I knew guys who were like dumping, you know, swapping from ETH over as much as they possibly could put in it. And I'm just like looking at the chart just like I missed it. Yeah, it was like 1:00. It was like 12. It was midnight 1:00 a.m. Eastern. And I just happen to be sitting here and just on when everyone's talking about it and I'm like just missed it. I know guys who literally made like you know nothing. You told me you round trip to Moonme coins, right? Oh my god. I have roundt thousands of soul thousands in 150 chunks. Like I literally if you It's so funny. I'm in I'm in some of these random like back chats and there's some guys that stood out to me and I paid the whatever two soul or 10 soul or whatever at the time just to like get in the game and just see what everyone's doing and then quickly found that my game is find the 10 to 30k like brand new launch game and like a meme scope on Photon or something like that. It's just like more fun for me. I don't know how to do it once it's already at a million and let it ride. I don't know what's going to stick. I don't know how high they can go. Like I have no idea. But if I can ride the 15k to whatever or like 10 to 30k ones to a couple million on that first big kick, like I have three coins on there I can right now off the top that I'm the number one trader on that I, you know, got more for my two soul buy and pulled out 250 or 300 or whatever on multiple occasions, but I have hundreds of times that I have taken it up to 50 in profit or 75 or 150 is like the joke is my number. I get up to 150 and then I start trying to like sell chunks out and then it starts to dip and I'm like, "Oh, wait." And I basically sell like five or 10 from two and leave 150 on the table and just rides to zero. Like so many times I cannot tell you. It's like, "Oh, we'll just sell half on the way up or do this and like lock in whatever." I'm like, "No, I have I have ridden it up past 100 and then back down and lost my uh principle like so many times. It's just not my game. It's not my game. I do it for fun. I sit here. where I plug in for 12 hours on like a random day when we don't have anything. I haven't done that in a minute, but you're most likely going to do it again. Yeah, it's fun, dude. It's fun. I mean, yeah, I turned in the count with like whatever 30 or 50 or something sold I put in there to like 500 and something. I hit two in a two in 24 hours or 40 or whatever it was. Basically, it was oneish, one and a half, two days, call it, where I turned a two into 200 and something and I turned like a three or four into 300 and something and like went from like basically 10 soul in one account to like 550 and then across the next month I basically sent it back down to 50. See, I have like some of my educators who are like that, right? But that's that's what they do. And they teach that to some members because they have that, you know, uh gambling money. They love it. I am out of this. I do not do it. Yeah. I don't touch NFTs. I don't touch memes. I don't do it. Yeah. Only NFTs I've ever dubbed on are the is when because I was working with Luca prior to him buying them and like it was just working on the street type thing and I was like, "Okay, whatever." Picked up a couple. It was like 1.5 and I bought two, rode those up, got the airdrop, did everything, you know. So, made whatever it was 30x the money on there. Didn't sell anything. Didn't even sell the coin even on the airdrop. Didn't sell the coin. So, the thing's worth whatever 200 and something. rides it down to like hold on till dear life, right? Yeah, but like am I like I just don't I I don't have I have no plan. Let me ask you this like what do you think about the crypto market? Where is it going to go? Give us right now. Oh my god, I'm the wrong person to ask this question. I I will stand I will stand on my ignorance. Why I'm asking because I want to understand what the general like you know people thinks the I mean I I look at Bitcoin you know I look at how I looked at in the beginning and in the beginning it was oh find the things that aren't the core thing and where you can make more. You know, that's that's the general sentiment is on altcoins, you're going to make this multiple in comparison to this core one that's only going to go up by x amount without realizing the core one, you know, Bitcoin going up x percentage is still massive in compared to other things, right? It's still multiples in compared to like a normal market or a normal whatever. So, like I'm I'm pretty sure I've never bought Bitcoin. Like, never. You're making a massive mistake. Of course I am. I know. And that's what I'm saying. It's like I'm pretty sure I've literally like when we end this call, please do me a favor. Go and buy Bitcoin. I have a lot of ETH, which is just the comical thing of this entire thing is like I always had a bunch of ETH and just kept buying it and it was on my DCAs. It was on my like all my stuff and then some random pockets of other things that I would have that I thought would have actual multiples. Also, this is not a, you know, our come up in like bigger numbers has been the last two or three years. And that was I was also living a different lifestyle at that time to where it was not the long-term focus. It was not the stock it all away. it was the oh, we're just going to continue to make more into the future, which is the dumbest way to look at it possible. And like I learned my lesson there and also living up this lifestyle or this life that was uh had a high burn rate. So like I was spending time there, which also my brain wasn't on doing that stuff. So like my brain's not on, I'm spending it and I'm not thinking about the future. It's like you add those three together and it's like of course I didn't buy it. Of course I wasn't in the position, you know? So whether it was there or not, I mean it was there and I and I was not there, right? So my view on it though is that is that I think it's going you know I think I up and to the right I think the more the standardization I think everything is going to happen. I see people talk how it's going to 10 million a coin. I see people talking how it's going to you know 250 and chilling for a while until it's 5 years from now. Like I have no idea. I get it. I think there's an interesting chapter also is like we're young guys, right? And we we've been successful. Like I think not enough people talk about it, but I see here in Dubai uh young guys make a lot of money. Like all they all like congregate here and they they just spend it all. And I've been there. I've spent I was going to say me too. I'm not I'm not throwing [ __ ] on anyone. It's just No, no, I've been there. I've been there. I've spent a lot of money on stupid [ __ ] Same. Um, but I think it's fascinating how sometimes I talk to people and they say, "Yeah, I'll just make it back." Like I don't if I have too much in my bank account, I'm going to stop and I have to keep going. And I'm like, that's a funny way to look at it. But yeah. Yeah. Cardone talks about like the he gets he empties the accounts or whatever. And that was, you know, these are OG videos that I'm referencing cuz I've watched him for a long time. But like the big empty out the checking account basically and instead of spending it, empty it out, put it into real estate and play that game. So you can't spend it. So you need to continue to work like lighting the fire under yourself that like you don't even have it in the checking account to like make rent or like buy food cuz you're constantly like emptying the checking account. The other the other way to do that is by spending it, not by investing it. And that was like a game I played. I've signed leases where I've been like this is not strategic and smart. and then a month into having the lease like made, you know, multiples of the entire term of it. But like it that's a dangerousing game. That is a dangerous game to play. It is not smart. It is not strategic. You're likely setting yourself up for something that's burning the cash, not investing it, like all those things. And I I worked with uh insurance and I use that as an example in here a lot on like how you can sell info and have these massive backends. And that's an example of like a middle ground backend in comparison to something you guys are talking about. It's like this massive monetization on the back end. His is, you know, you sell info coaching, you can make your multiples on rorowes, you can build your business, but then when people buy insurance, you get like the long tail of that, right? You get commissioned and then you get over x amount of time. You have partnership referrals to things like estate attorneys like this, this, this, like you can make more spiffs across the the thing. But that was one of the bigger things that opened my mind to, you know, everyone talks like compounding, everyone talks that like the whole life insurance game. People do ILS, people do, you know, you there's a million different variations of it, but that idea of and hormones talks about this about like being able to like, you know, the whole be your own bank concept, the infinite banking. There's a lot of variations of this, but that's our angle by the way, be Yeah, I didn't know that. With DeFi, you know, the bankers and I'm an ex banker, so yeah, it works. Yeah. I I mean, I loved the model, but that was the first time I actually started to think like a little bit longer term and be like, "Oh, okay, cool. So if you're just putting 50 grand to this thing a year or whatever number or 500 like that just sits and cooks and the ability to be able to use it to lend against to buy things but then only on you know things that actually have a like a return like just that whole mindset of things I was just never there. I was just like exactly what you said. I'll just make more and it'll continue to make more and why would I never make ever make less. You invest a bit of money though in real estate cuz I'm going to tell you in real estate. No. So I did this game. You shouldn't. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. And I also I also refused to use my skills. It's the worst investment out there. Real estate. It's the worst for what? In terms of returns today. In terms of returns or Yeah, exactly. But again, I don't know enough about this, so everyone's going to torch me in this, but like I have plenty of people in my life that have crushed it with real estate, both in terms of active and passive and the taxation port and like all of it, right? So, I have a bunch of people I know. My thing has been I got back here and now it made sense to do cuz I had basically no taxes where I was for the last x amount of years. So, like didn't make sense at that time to focus on it. I got back here and was like, "All right, maybe I should, you know, put x amount of time or into a bucket where I focus on this for the tax mitigation for that for potential, you know, future, you know, equity builds, longer term thinking." And I started to get into it and I was like, you know what, I am not going to interest map, spend these side quests, do these things on things that will not directly help the main business right now. And that is not a long-term thought. That is not a whatever. That's like a right now what's hot and what feeds the main machine so that the cash flow that comes in is so undeniable and so like then I need to do these other things. Not your unit of time. Where do I allocate my one unit of time for the best return? Yes. And like in the short term it's this and that's for sure in the long term and like you know I don't want to just throw money in a bucket and all of a sudden just start giving it out to you know funds that do this. you can get that honestly you're going to outperform anyone out there be it real estate be it like financial planners be it stock just by buying Bitcoin and also a second thing is you're thinking about the upside think about the downside if tomorrow the dollar gets devalued and it well you need Bitcoin because now now okay I'm I'm I'm changing your way of thinking okay you're making all that cash but it's in US dollars 100% of your net worth is in US dollars Okay. What if the dollar loses half its value? You're Yeah, I I get it. I get it. I also was a guy who was, you know, listening to whatever when it was like, you know, you're the what was it? Your uh inflation is burning the dollar sitting in your cash account, put it all in crypto. And that's when they, you know, gamed the whole thing to send it all freaking to zero at all around the same time. And I was like, you know, I didn't sell anything, so like I was fine, but it was just classic. It was like the classic mania of whenever that was tail end of COVID and when everyone was talking about that. It's just I, you know, I'm just not involved in the game enough. I also, the other one of real estate is the tax portion because you don't have that, right? You don't play. When you mentioned the taxes, I was like, yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. And I also didn't play, you know, I played the different game for a minute and now I'm in a world where or in a loca, you know, I don't know things can change for me in that. And again, right now it's like where should the main focus be? And for me, the main focus right now should be on the generation, should be on the growth of the business, should be on the overall, you know, you go a step deeper is like the actual enterprise, not just cash, not just cash flow month over month. So, we're targeting that, but then it has to be on deck. It has to be because if not, you're literally lighting on fire 50% of it. Um, you're lighting it. Yeah. Which you don't have to play that game. No, cuz you chose not to buy. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, by the way, I watched one of your videos. It was the most insane value ever. It's the We made 683K last week. Yeah. Yeah. And you said something like literally cuz you know I'm going back to marketing now so I had to tell you live. So I watched that full video and you explained how you saw your vision was like three funnels with three angles right and then within the funnel like within the idea like one big idea you're going to have like one optin straight to book a call one DTA and one low ticket. All right. And three angles with three faces. And that removes the founder risk. I think that was so smart that I just took it. I'm going to do the same. That I just took it. I love it. No, dude. I'm so excited for ours. We had a meeting right before this cuz it's what? Yeah. Today is like meeting central. I have like nine meetings, which is hilarious. But the they're launching. So, we're going to we're starting with VSSL only. So, right now we have two VSSLs. I kind of talk about this, but like as I've shifted to where my focus is, it was all on marketing for a minute. It was all on sales. Like my the channel follows what I'm doing on a daily basis because I'm making them every day. So, it's like whatever I'm doing, it's hot on the brain. and I can make a mirror and I can rip like if not I have to like change states but we are doing so right now we have two VSSL optin funnels that are brand face one initial that are running so but two different messaging two different optin pages two different VSSLs we have the same then and you're the brand face on those yeah then we have a low ticket which is brand face one and then we have a DTA which is brand face one that's actually that VSSL is the second of the opt-in VSSLs so same one just different one has a gated one's gated with opt-in and one is direct to app that's the current flow and like what's app operating current state now we're waiting on editors to get the VSSL's back but we have two coming back that are going to be the two different messaging with brand phase 2 and three that are different messaging pockets and like story based and like around that because it's a completely different person so we have the opportunity to leverage different stories different demo different everything so we're going to have four VSSL ops and then just those two core the DTA in to start and then once these ones have traction then they'll get accompanied by an aligned messaging uh low ticket. One question, if one of these new faces slash messaging doesn't work, how will you know if it's the face or the messaging? I already know the faces work because I use them right now towards the main funnels and they work. Mhm. With no continuity. They work. Okay. Because I'm going to tell you something very funny or congruency more so no congruency. So my head of education is a white Caucasian male that resembles our demo and I don't. Right. Yeah. And so my sales sales reps keep telling me why do we keep getting Indians on our calendars because they're very difficult to do business with. And I was like, and then I listened to one of your vid. Is it yours where you say like, no, I I don't think it's yours, but anyway, meta basically matches your face to the Oh, yeah. That's not Yeah, that's not me saying that. But no, I I' I've heard that. I've heard it pulls scripts now fully pulls keywords out like all that. It's crazy. But yeah, the visual of it too. I mean, for so for us right now, we'll run three brand face one, two, and three as ads. We try and do a bit of a pass off. It's like, oh, the free training by Brand face one. and we'll like kind of try and do that. But, you know, people don't make it to this very end of an ad or whatever. They land on a lander that has the opt-in is the brand face one on the image and the thumbnail and then the VSSL is all brand face one. So, it works right now. it crushes right now with those different faces and you're basically looking at the ad metric level because like do they get higher CTR because it's you know you have the same pocket of audience and you have three different brand faces that are basically the same script basically the same whatever and it's like these ones have as higher higher CTRs lower cost per click because they're in the demo and they're in the demo in terms of the age and what they're talking about and how their body looks and all that stuff and fitness in our world but that was a big one for us that we didn't have that you know again and this is all goes to show you're not in you're not your demo. Uh, our Brand Face One and co-founder Rockstar is not in our demo and we did 71 through her, right? Like we did. You don't need it as long as you know it. Yeah. Horosi said something in a video yesterday. It's like someone looks at you and then like is their initial judgment. Sure. But as soon as you start talking, it shifts. And if you know what you're talking about and you're legit and you're this and that and your framing is correct and your edification and all of that, it doesn't matter in my, you know, in my opinion. Um, yeah. So, okay. That's reassuring. It's reassuring. I mean, you just did it. You guys are at what, 50 in total. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And newer and all this. So, we have a race, everyone, publicly. Uh, we're going to hang out in London in a couple weeks, but we have a race that we're not going to talk about what the number is, but just know there's there's going to be a bet included in this and we're going to we're going to gamble. And I love to win. And he loves to win. And uh I generally am pretty quiet about my competition levels, but just know it's real. So, I got to pop in 2 minutes for a legal review meeting, but anything else? We'll we'll do this in person. We'll do another one cuz I think you and I talk all day every day basically. And you and like three other guys that I've met through this that do similar size are like the ones I actually talk to and like consistently have communication with and it's just cool to bounce ideas. You've sent stuff over. I mean, oh wow, I didn't even talk about this, but the talent thing like it has been such a help uh in both directions. Like I've gotten on calls dedicated one-on-one with your marketing tech or whatever you'd call that position for your company and talked shop on how we do things with data and structuring and like split test and HubSpot information and done stuff like that. And then you sent over your cso or world of sales sent over referrals when we were hiring sales and we landed a rockstar all through you. So like yeah, major shout out there and major shout out to the content for then finding us together and then like it's great bro. you opened my eyes and I want to make content now more like less around investment, more around business because talking to you like I've made leaps into where like understanding what I should do and where I should go and again you also shared a lot of things with me. So I mean I just love that like sharing value is dope. Yeah, I was going back and forth yesterday and me sending you that or last week me sending you that SOP and then you sending me that video for Zoom. I got sent that over to our team. They edited one and now we have like a 30 second amazing testimonial reel slideshow that has text on it if they don't turn on audio like the whole thing. And instantly we got like three comments on it already that are like, "Oh, that video is so cool." Yeah. That's from potential clients because all because I joined your Zoom room and saw it. Yeah. Look, there's like when you think about business, right, there's a million small things that you could do and it really depends on like what you get influenced with, what you like, your affinities, what you're thinking about. And so you can't just do it do do them all. You have to pick. Right. Yeah. And so when you talk to uh people in your space that do your size that have the same problems as yours when they tell you it helps you think so well and you're immediately able to tell, okay, for one unit of time here, what will I get back? Worth doing. All right, let's do it. Yeah, I like that thinking. That makes a lot of sense. We'll jam in person. We'll do another one of these. I got to pop. But you're rockstar. We'll talk soon, everyone. That's day 76, I believe, in the books. Bye, guys.

# how I'm building a “Niche Personal Brand” | EP74
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN6C6rRK_9g

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how I'm scaling my niche personal brand. I started making videos 74 days ago, and today is video number 74. So, we're going to talk through how I approach this, what my initial plan and goals were, fast forward to today, and what my learnings and outcome of that plan were, and then how I'm iterating that on the plan to the future. This will be extremely helpful for you if you are looking to build a niche personal brand. Last year, we did over $30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over actually 74 million in total cash collected in that business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what I'm actively doing literally and with all with the goal of finding top talent for our companies, opportunities, and network with cool people building cool So, let's get into it. So, this is a little bit meta because you guys are obviously watching this. Uh, and I hate the word ph or the phrase personal brand, but we're here now. It's going to get some clicks. So, when I started this, it was essentially zero. So, I had like a 100red on X. I had an old account and I started to post on it a little bit. I had 800 on Instagram, which is like family, friends, and like some people. And I had 80 on YouTube somehow. I don't even know how, but I did. So, the initial plan and how I came to it was like, oh, I don't want to be like an Iman or Hermosi level person. And that's like saying, and it's so it's such a silly like frame to be in and just wrong. So, that's like saying, I don't want to look like Mr. Olympia, so I'm not going to go to the gym. Like, you're not just overnight going to have millions of followers and be seen by everyone and do all this stuff, nor do you have to be on the content wheel and like do all that stuff as much as they do. And I was just so wrong about that. And I was like, okay, so how do I approach this? So, I paid for a course. I actually paid for Iman's AFL1 which was I don't know 20 grand I think. Um and paid for that and there's a bunch of good stuff in there but really what it was was just a kick in the ass for me to just start posting. So instead of doing high quality videos and getting cameras and setup and lighting that was just seemed like too high of like it just didn't seem approachable for me. So I was like I'm just going to do these raw so I can just shoot looms. I initially started with looms and then moved into this software which is screen studio. So I know my video is like over here. I guess I'm pointing at that but I'm in the corner but you can make it all these other places and it's like super fancy and I don't use any features. I just export. So I was like I'm just going to talk about what I know which is marketing tech and ops. Last year we had just crossed over 30 million. So I was like okay cool. We grew from 12 to 30. I can talk about the things I know about that which in my scope is really like I guess the entire business and more so as I scaled into this but was really about understanding marketing the marketing tech and the operations of the business. So I was like I can just talk about that and I'll post weekly target three to three to 5k of like a honeypot on YouTube and X. And Iman was like yeah you should just do it on those two platforms. do long form on YouTube and conversational on X. I start posting on X and instead of doing weekly I was like I'll just go daily like whatever. I I mean I would rather do that. Woke up early in the morning and was just making these mirror boards. Uh actually wasn't even using mirror in the in the beginning was using Google Docs and I just started posting every single day. Um so the goal was to get three to 5,000 of what my honeypot was. So I defined the niche for me as high six figure seven figure a month entrepreneurs. So people who are online business, info coaching, ecom, lead genen, affiliates at like that world of people that are just hitters in that space and the number is arbitrary, but it's just someone who's at that level or that that thinking. So I can then get talent. So you know, through their networks, have following for talent. Um, everyone knows everyone once you get, you know, one connection away type understanding. Um, and then opportunities wise, I was like, okay, maybe I'll just find companies that can get equity and maybe uh make a couple million bucks a year doing that and then really just network with people. So, I just have access to a cool network that when I'm in a city or I want to talk about something, I don't really have any local friends or friends in general that were in the space. So, I was like, "This is the goal. I'm going to share the the wins and the losses because the big thing with me is like you see everyone share these like really high production things that are all about the wins." And there's some good out there too, for sure, that are like how-to exacts and day in the lives and stuff that are cool to see and like are inspirational, but not a ton about the L's. or if it is, it's just like a big focus on that and then it quick transitions over and it's like now but here's how I won out of that somehow and like made all this money and like buy my thing and for me I was like I'm not going to do that. So, examples of how I guess these are this isn't really initial plan because this is as I did it. But yeah, I mean I was sharing videos when we were losing month uh money month over month and we were doing you know 1.5 whatever. I did month reviews. I did daily updates on cash. I was sharing days we did 30 grand which is like you know we're losing money when it comes to team ops ad spend everything. Um and now in the videos and you know this can change quickly as we all know but uh we're pacing you know record new monthly into this next month. Um and it's the 25th today but you know we're crushing this month. I'll do a month and review that you guys can see at the end of this. But yeah, so that was just the initial plan was just beat the drum, get to 385,000. Interesting part about this before I go into like where we got to today. I was on day 34 or five and I had like 300 on these platforms. I had like maybe a thousand on Instagram. That one started to slowly tick up. And I don't even use Instagram. I don't know how. I sit at my desk all day and I need to get better at that. But like I don't have like day in the life or like lifestyle or stuff that I do other than just work on this. But X was good because I could share stuff, but was very very low. And YouTube was like slow ticking. So I got to like 300 and something um on YouTube after like 34 days. It was basically like 10 a day roughly. Then somebody that I was messaging with because I was still getting a bunch of DMs from pretty high quality people on uh Instagram and uh someone was like, "I'm about to put you on, about to put you on." And they shared me on X. And my ex just exploded. I went to like 2400 on X in like two days. Uh YouTube jumped to like 2500, 2,300, something like that. Um Instagram jumped a little, not a ton. And yeah, I just got beating the drum. So that was on like day 34 and so now it's been another 40 days and the growth curve of it slowed but had like increased the overall floor of all the views on YouTube. Uh the subscriber like amount every single day and it's just like consistently grown. So I started to really really lean into X and now like I 500 is low. I'm just saying 500. Um, I get 10 to 20 DMs a day and there's a there are beginners, no doubt. Um, you know, based on my initial target being this honeypot, but I have over a hundred people that are doing over a million a month in info, ecom, like it's crazy, crazy, crazy. And like it's not just info, ecom, it's info, ecom, agency, lead genen, like just a bunch of people who have crushed it. And that and I'm also including in this cuz I think it's probably like 80 or so of this because I have them flagged in there. Um, but then there's a bunch that have done exits or that are outside of the online space. So, I'm not including those guys in in I'm including those guys in this number, but they're not really, you know, million a month guys. Um, and there's five that I talked to that are doing over three million a month, which is like more than us, equal to us amounts, which is cool. So, there's definitely some people that are doing like way bigger numbers in other industries and stuff, but in in phone coaching, I haven't directly talked to anyone um that is, but it just goes to show like this content and how I'm doing this video right here attracted these people, right? And I try to be like no fluff, no ego. It's not meant to be like douchy or whatever when I'm like oh 74 million in this it's like you know show in proof and then instantly go into like listen we take L's every day and we do all this stuff and like literally yesterday our call confirmation thing broke so it didn't go into Slack so then setters didn't confirm calls and I had like a 34% show rate and we lost however you know 50 grand on that day of opportunity cost so like every single day but side tangent so access to talent I tested that as my first one that was my first you know goal I wanted to get and we posted for a sales manager one of these guys that's just like a whale super cool had never heard of his company and they did 30 million in info last year. His sales manager reached out to his network and knew a guy, connected me with him and we hired him and now he's crushing for us. So, it's like that worked which is great. And then opportunities was an interesting one because I don't know what necessarily I was expecting with that. It was just kind of like sounded like a good idea to get it and I get this flooding in. So like the mix between these numbers is people trying to pay for hourly consulting. Do you have a course? Do you have a mastermind? Can I pay what any of this stuff and I just deny it all. Well, I basically I'm just like, "Hey, send me a Google doc. send me a loom, ask me questions, do any of this stuff and like I'm happy to help and I do I'm getting kind of behind on them actually which is why I created the Q&A request thing and those don't get submitted to there because people don't want to share their numbers publicly which I understand but yeah so I've just denied these so I don't I mean I'm going to go into my new plan here but this one's interesting and the network's huge so now I can post on X and get feedback on things I can have conversations with people that I couldn't before and that's where we get into new plan so my goal right now is to just beat the drum to 100 is like my next 30-day goal basically is I want to get to daily. So, I'm at 74. I'm going to get to at least 100 and I may need to slow the volume and go to X days a week and go to three to five days a week somewhere in there. Maybe I'll love it and I'll be on some new wave and continue to do it. Uh, right now I kind of have the time, but like I've definitely sacrificed some things and I'm not good at skill man. Like my skill in my time management of like trying to run the company, trying to do YouTube, trying to like do all these other things in my personal life is like really bad. So, I need to solve for that somehow and I'm working on that. But like I need to hit the hundred. I need to I need to. So um yeah but from the how do I explain this part? So for the talent portion it's turned into conversations. So the shared so sharing all this stuff has found me. I guess this is probably the wrong word but it's more like network turned into conversations. So the network that I've now built through these socials has given me access to have conversations with a bunch of people that like I've looked up to for a long time or that are crushing in the space that I've never heard of and who have cool insights. So, what I'm starting to do is do conversations. So, I have like a massive list. I made a list of like 80 people and I'm trying to get up to a hundred where I can just do onetoone conversations with them and then post those. So, I'm sure if you guys go to the channel, you will see I have I think six or seven of them so far. I talked to Eddie first. That one crushed. I've talked to Josh Gavin. I've talked to Amed, Brooke, Hadink. I've talked to like all these guys who are cruising. Um, and it's cool because I didn't know any of them prior and they found me through this and then we ended up getting connected. I have, you know, Mark Scales brands. I have um that just I have a bunch of people. You can go on my ex and see the list. But now I can have conversations with these people that I would not have been able to do here. So now instead of me just spewing at the internet and just making videos like this, I'm now able to have conversations about what's working now. What's your business model? How is that structured? Oh, that's interesting. You guys do low ticket here and you do high ticket here. Oh, your back end is like or it's all organic and your back end is, you know, this crazy has this crazy LTV because you do this. Like just cool stuff that I get to learn and then get to share with you guys. and we try not to share like too much private information, but they're fun. So, I need to get better at structuring those conversations. So, in my new plan, because I've heard, you know, some people watch all of them, some people say that I talk too much, some people all that stuff. So, I'm trying to like change and structure how I do these, but not make them too rigid with their like interviews. Like I said, go to x amount of days a week. I'm down to continue to like I'm definitely going daily up until 100. Like, I just have to um which is going to be hard because I have some international flights and stuff, so it's going to be funny, but we're going to make it work. So, do that. And then after that, I think what my goal is, everyone shreds me on accident. Like, you'd think a marketer would understand how to get these to work and get these to get more views. And it's like I don't Yeah, I do. I understand the list of 12 things I need to do. And I don't want to do them. I don't want to spend I'm already like spread pretty thin trying to just do these every day long form um and make these docs and whatever. I know this one's not that intense, but like I have some pretty intense ones I make and I need to get better though at the packaging, pre-prep, etc. And I still want to make them raw, but there are ways to package these, make better um visuals, make better process walkthroughs of stuff we're doing. And also, if I go to more X days a week, I basically talk about like what's hot now or like what we're working on now. And I think I'll be better at like piecing and parting that and being able to look back and be like, "Oh, this part of marketing structure I can talk for 30 minutes on very specific and have a ton of or like processes. This portion of sales management I can talk about in this way. this portion of how we're doing LTV to CAC I could talk about in this way with like really in-depth models not just like whipping them together. So I think this will be more helpful get more views and maybe probably be more impactful because I might go a little slower and more thought through. So I think that'll help and I don't know I don't know what the market size is but like right now I'm almost at 5K right on these. So maybe 10K. I know guys that are in this world that have like I pulled up a thing of who watches or like what other channels do people watch that watch mine and it's like Jeremy Haynes and some of these other guys. um Bizroids, you know, Becker's, uh Iman's business channel, stuff like that. And those guys have like 20, 30, 50K. Um so I think that's I don't really know what the target is, but this direction. And then I do think I want to lean into some of the Instagram stuff, but the only thing there is I don't live the life like that. Like what would I don't know what I would share like my desk and I don't want to do reels and all that stuff. I don't think like I just don't think that that's my vibe. I think I'll get the wrong audience because again, I still have the same goal. I want access to talent. I want opportunities to do cool deals. And I I do want to talk about that a little bit for the opportunities. My goal there has just shifted. I don't want to monetize in the way that all these guys monetize and sell some course or consulting or whatever. Like I'm literally not selling you anything. I just want to have access to it and build it up and then have some way that maybe we all, you know, there's criteria that are in a group chat or in some like in-person event so I can meet everyone in person which is kind of more the networking one. Um, but then yeah, maybe into the future as we scale this like I want to fullon lean into the business we're scaling and we are leaning into that. Um, but maybe into the future there's opportunities to do more of a hormosy style where we do get equity and lean those maybe. I don't know. It's just like not even on the radar. So, nothing is for sale and you can't buy anything and I'm happy to answer questions if you structure them well and don't just send me voice notes. But yeah, I don't know. I I've liked this journey so far. I hate this personal brand word. I can't even believe I'm making these, but like we're here now and we are. So, hope this was help for you guys. All to say, if you're trying to do this, it's really about just picking a niche that is like really specific and then making making sure that your content, the content style, all that stuff tailor to them because I I don't think I could do these raw videos and go to like a zero to 10K audience, which is like the, you know, beginners and all like at the same way that I could do this. Like they like the flashy, it's like they like the quick with it, the edits, the stuff. So, they can like, you know, shorter attention span. And I'm going for people who like my docs and who like the simple stuff and who like, you know, simple is maybe the wrong word, but um just raw. Just raw. So, I hope this has got across and gets to the right people. Um I'm constantly trying to evolve and scale and learn new things. This has identified a ton of things for me that I am not good at. Specifically, like I said earlier, like I have no EA. I have none of that stuff. And it's difficult for me to manage all this. And I'm like dropping the ball all over the place and I'm checking X and then YouTube and like building this chart and then I'm like, "Oh, wait. I got to go do this." And then I come back and I'm like what? I'm oh the chart. And like I get slacks at 8:00 p.m. and 11 and like it's just all over the board and I'm trying to get better at that. So this has introduced a lot of actual struggle to that or this portion more so. Um so yeah. So just trying to constantly evolve and find new cool people. But that's that. Um daily update. All these videos are on the www.rroncl um on here. I actually have to update the last few videos on there but I sort them by tech sales marketing ops uh mindset. And you can go through here so you can see the main idea of what these ones are about. There's a ton of golden nuggets in these. Um I put them on a playlist so you can watch them in order, but there's no order. So I would start here uh if you want where you can actually just sort them by this or filter by the category that you're stuck on or what your bottleneck is. And yeah, that's what this is all about is just constantly progressing. That's my goal in life right now is just progression. So personal, physical, uh financial, business, all the things. Just trying to progress and just go towards it. So yeah. And then the overall daily update is we're cruising. I'm going to do a monthly update at the end, but we're trending towards three, which is crazy because we were like 1.59, I think, last month or 1.5, somewhere in that range. Um, so hopefully we're going to have a massive June. Um, but right now, just trying to figure out or finish out May. So, appreciate you guys. Any questions as always, um, X or Instagram DMs are pretty good. So, I'll talk to you guys soon.

# Funnels, Closers, Crypto, and Pricing (49min Q&A) | EP73
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6WU754_0w

What's up, guys? In today's video, we're going to be having some fun and going through our weekly weekend Q&A round five. All these questions were submitted to the request box over the last week. And today, we're going to deep dive answer all of them. I have briefly reviewed these and it looks like we have everything from some beginner what would you do from zero questions to some deep context where people are stuck with things like offers, pricing, and scale. We even have some guys in here that are doing 5600K a month in cash collected. So, today is going to be very tactical and very useful for you. Last year we did 30 million cash collected and we have now crossed over 74 million actually in total cash collected in our info coaching business. And I don't want your money. I'm not selling anything. No guru, no course, nothing. All I'm doing is sharing what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to over $und00 million a year in our business. And I do this because I want to find talent. I want to find opportunities. And I want to build a network of cool people doing cool All right, simple as that. So, let's get into it. I have enough caffeine and nicotine to run for a long time. time. So, we'll see. All right. First one. I think you kind of already covered the tech stack, but for a business that's doing around 30K per month, what was the ideal tech stack should be? I've been bouncing between a few email providers and I'm switching to GHL soon, but I've been having a hard time sticking with a specific stack of softwares. What was your guys tech stack in the beginning stages or what would you recommend where to start? Okay, so for us, this is going to depend on what business model or what funnel types you are running, but for us, we initially started as a direct to cart. So, we were using ClickFunnels. um, Stripe for the processing, but Clickfunnels for all the funnels, pages, everything like that. And then in the beginning, we were actually using infusionoft and then moved over to Active Campaign for CRM. Um, and then we actually moved over to Shopify for a minute and used Clavio on the back end and that, but where we ended up landing on uh, it's kind of a big stack because we're on a callunnel. So, you're going to need your forms. So, we use Jot Form, Kally for your booking widget, we use HubSpot for our CRM, we use ClickFunnels for our order forms and sales pages. You could use it for your whole website, but we use Web Flow for the whole website. So, that's just like the core basic stack. Um, but what you would need, I mean, GHL is going to have everything you need. I've only worked in GHL a little bit. Um, I think they have a great thing going, but I really like dedicated tools that are really good for what they do, not all-in-one tools, personally. Um, but GHL will be able to do everything you need. Uh, for 30K a month, million. I mean, you can go real high on GHL as long as you use some of the integrations and some of the custom stuff. Um, or not custom, but a little more advanced stuff. So yeah, GHL will be able to do everything you need and I think it's like 300 bucks a month or something like that and it's it's everything. So I would just do that if you just want something simple out of the box. But then yeah, depending on your funnel, you need to understand which tech tools you need. I love HubSpot. I think it's expensive even in the beginner. I know ours is expensive, but we have you know millions of contacts and you know hundred users and seats. So I know it's expensive for us and I'm not ex exactly sure but I think it's a great platform. You can really scale into it. A lot of other guys use close.io or close.com. I think they bought now. And that one's really good for sales team specific. But for us, HubSpot can do all the marketing, sales, and a lot of those other pieces. Um, next one. I am 18, averaging 10 to 15K per month. Nice. I was not doing that at 18. And now building my new agency in cash flow. Will improve soon. Okay. Well, it's already doing all right. But how do you manage cash flow? I find it super hard to actually spend money, and I have somewhat of a scarcity mindset. Lots of people talk about abundance and waste a bunch of cash to make it back. Is it really worth it? How do I manage cash flow? So, uh, the technical answer of this is we have sheets and reporting and stuff that actually manages cash flow. And I don't think that's what you're asking me, but, uh, all money in, all money out, bucketed, what percent is in what, right? Like your P&L kind of classic, but for us, we have real-time day overday cash flow, so we can see what's actually happening. Um, when you're talking about not, it's hard to spend money. I think what you're saying is building the business and like spending more money on team to grow the business and at some level yes that is like a scarcity mindset for sure but also you know 18 lean and mean running this there are ways with a lot of automations VAS light team that you can get a lot higher than this with like very lean team so uh I think that's what you're asking me um is it really worth it to scale into yes there is the issue which is something you don't even really need to think about right now but you can get too big but I I guess you could think of it because think about if you hired three buddies for 5k a month right now like you would have no more right you'd have no more profit you'd have no more cash flow um so that's like the simple example but for us like when we were scaling we were going from 1 to 3 million a month and we started hiring like in advance for all these positions not necessarily where it hurt but where we thought we were going to need it and it burned a lot of cash that was unnecessary. So between mismanagement of people, between efficiency, between just overall headcount, uh that was an issue. And then same thing with some we didn't go too hard with some of the tech tools, but we definitely leaned into ads really really heavy. So for us, just as an example, you know, if we're making 10 15k in profit, we're like, "Oh, we need to spend that back into ads like instantly because we were banking on future money and future all this stuff for like a longer LTV, not like initial cash only." And that has burned us or more so burned profit that didn't need to be. So, I would think of it like that. And then in terms of like I think I'm trying to understand this question, but I have some somewhat of a scarcity mindset and abundance, waste cash to make it back. Yeah, you're going to have to reinvest whether it's time that you're investing or whether it's money. And it's kind of a trade-off usually between those two. But yeah, I think that I think that's what you're asking me. If you're starting from zero today, what would you do based on your current knowledge? So, based on my current knowledge uh is really in this space and kind of online business overall, but not really. I mean my direct experience is in with is within the info coaching world. Um so I would likely do something like that. I would find an expert and uh I would go Josh Gavin mode and I would build something around an expert. I would own with my current understanding and knowledge I could get 70 80 90% of the company to build and then have them as the expert whether if it was if I was starting from zero and I had no cash I would have to give them a percent because I wouldn't be able to pay them. Now I would like to I would just pay them uh I wouldn't even give them that uh a percent of it likely. I would just, you know, use their IP, brand them, and then build a business around them. So, that's generally what I would do. I would pick a niche that is, I know, is luxury, high, you know, high ticket space style that has really good results. I would pick something that very likely is outside of the whole like make money online space. Um, there are some pockets within there that I think do great, but I would start there. Um, because I would pick an expert that could dominate niche. Think high ticket, think life insurance, think financial planning, think um, you know, B2B style things where you can have a 25K plus ticket because then you can really just lean into ads and you have a lot more room for error and as long as the results are there, there's even bigger LTVs on the back end. So, I would do that. Um, and I would just run the whole business and never be in a single ad or on the face. Getting started. I don't know what that means. Um, Facebook ad testing and campaign structures. I just asked my CMO about this. We're probably going to pop on and do one of these. But he, if you go back to the videos on the channel, we do like a round table where we're all just sitting there like a bunch of dumb asses in black t-shirts because we were at an event and for some reason that's a thing on accident. But, uh, he talks about this where he basically says, you know, Facebook just came out with you should test ads before you drop them into CBOS. So he goes into how the different optimizations he chooses in the beginning based on how many conversions you can get, how you should test these ads in ABOS's to basically warm them up and then move those post IDs into CBOS's is his like general structure. Um there's, you know, 92 more nuances and things I'm sure, but that is simply that and then I'll have him on and we'll do some one to one on like what's working now for our funnels and our and our paid side. So I apologize in advance for the length of this question. You're good, but I'd like to give you as much context as possible. I think these are very helpful and the context is very helpful. So just for everyone into the future and if you want to submit these I do these every week. So up here um I have no one in my life who understands online space like you do. So it would mean a lot if you give me feedback. Got you. I've recently put all my focus into growing sports pages on TikTok and gained over 33,000 followers in the past 30 days, bringing my total follower count to about 70. I assume that means other places. I plan to start monetizing these pages through selling sports picks and affiliate deals with sports books. Once I've mastered this monetization strategy, I want to start selling info in the form of mentorship to help other sports fans start, grow, and monetize their own sports pages. Okay. Problem for me is I've always excelled academically and have very strong desire to be successful. I recently got a full ride to law school. Let's go. And feel immense pressure from my family to go down the traditional path, which would be much more guaranteed, but I don't want to work the 9 to5. I want to do well in law school, but I also dream life involves making money online, getting the freedom. Freedom is the big one there, uh, in my opinion. Do you think the sports page monetization into info strategy is a viable plan with potential and something I would do on the side while studying in law school until I make enough to justify following this career I'm on? All right, so that's like uh that's a loaded one. So, first of all, congrats. This is fantastic. A lot of people don't get this. Um up here, first of all, building out this and then going into info to sell it. Two very different things. I would almost recommend don't go into info. Why create competition for yourself in the space if you can dominate this? I know a couple guys local actually that I don't really know really well, but I hear they absolutely crush this where they build these like branded pages on Instagram and Tik Tok and like these huge things and then go off and you know people buy these things for tens of millions of dollars once they're built up. Like think of I'm not a big sports guy so excuse my ignorance on this, but there's like gaming ones. I know there are just like general meme pages and there's like niche specific ones around sports or whatever. And you build these pages that have this audience and then you can sell those. You can either, you know, sell ad space, you can set, there's so many different ways to monetize once you have this built up of an audience. Um, so I would just lean into this. So I would network with other guys that are doing this. I'm sure there's Telegram groups. I'm sure there's chats. I'm sure on X people are doing this where they build these massive branded pages and then either sell them or then monetize them aggressively. Um, and there's a lot of ways to do that, especially in this niche to my understanding. Um, so selling sports picks, whether you partner with someone to do that and get a crazy good affiliate deal or just have an affiliate deal direct, I think that's a great way. this part right here where it's like I want to info and mentor people to do it. I wouldn't do that. That is that it's more of a short-sighted cash thing. Like if you can come up with some big backend where like you get I I don't even know if I do this because the the real play on this is what's the back end of this business, not what's the 10 grand or 50 grand or 200 grand you make a month teaching people how because you're instantly creating competition for yourself. Unless there's some way like I know a guy who does this with lead genen and when he teaches people how to do lead genen he's technically creating competition for himself but like one the market is so big and two once they get in there they either a lot of them become media buyers for him over time because they're like oh I just rather get funded to do it or they join all these affiliate networks or lead genen networks and stuff and he gets a percentage of everything they make like very very small but like it's really more the networking play and then them joining his team. So I don't know that you should do info though. What should you do with your life? Um, I don't know how much time you have in a day or how much time you want to dedicate to this, but I don't see why you couldn't do I know law school is very intensive. My sister did law school. She did full ride too actually. Shout out. Um, but she was in the trenches and she was very very it was very busy for her. So, if you can navigate them both, I mean, I would lean into this and just keep building this and beat the drum. Beat the drum. Get around people and grow that. I would still do this, especially if it's like a family thing and this is like a great achievement, especially if you want to do it over time. There's ways to make massive amounts of money in business and life with law. Um, but if that's not something you want to do and that's something that would be okay with you and your family, I I'm not maybe not the person to answer this for you and your specific. Um, but yeah, I mean, lean into the sports page, decide if you want to do this or if it's okay with family and like I don't know if you can take a break or not, but like I would do that. I don't know how much I don't know what your goal is in life, but if your goal in is is freedom, I know that the traditional route of this is not really that freeing. Over time it can be, but this definitely can be. So hopefully that's helpful. Hey Ryan, appreciate all the value. Drop. Quick question from two entrepreneurs. Double question. All right. Or building a fitness coaching business. Where'd you get that idea? Uh targeting a specific niche. Religious women. Okay. Age 20 to 40 and focus on weight loss through fitness, nutrition, and mindset with a longevity focus. All right. We are considering one thing. Actually, I'm going to read this first and then I'll answer. Uh we're going to consider two 12week models. So 12 weeks is what? Three months. So, weekly one-on-one calls for 850 or small group one to four coaching for 500 a person, 2K per group. Total and lead sourcing is organic. You're doing content to an intake form to a sales call. This is what we do as well except we do uh paid. We might test a group webinar to offer or low ticket upsell flow later. My goal is 50K a month with the solid delivery and strong results and accessible price point. And from your operator lens, are these models viable with weekly coaching at these price points while hiring other coaches? Any early flags we should watch out for? Um, all right. So, first things first, this niche. I love a good niche. I'm a big fan. But I don't necessarily know that I understand why specifically or like what you're layering in that makes it for religious other than in your marketing because a big thing that when you do a niche is that it's throughout the entire there there's continuity across the entire company I guess and across from like the front to the back. So yes, you can use it in your ads but you also use it in your fulfillment. You also use it it's in your community. It's in everywhere. So I don't know if that's the goal or if your plan is in alignment there. Um, so I would make sure that first. Um, because once someone gets in and it's like, "Oh, it's for religious women." And they come in and yes, there's other ones around there because it's only when you sell, but like is it is it focused on that? Is there part of that in here? Maybe in the mindset portion. Uh, this model one-on-one calls versus group coaching, the pricing different. So, first of all, that's very cheap. 850. So, we'll just call that a,000 because my brain's not working right now and it's early. But a,000 bucks for that's four grand a year. Yeah, because it's three months. So, it's four grand a year or it's less than four grand a year. So, that's that's definitely cheap uh for one to one, but if you're just getting started, I mean, I get it to start and just try and get like get some get some momentum, get some client results, get people in the door. I mean, you could even do it for less if that's your goal. If you don't have any, you know, direct case studies or results and things around this, the onetoone versus group. So, what you're selling them is the result. Uh I mean, kind of the process, but what you're mainly selling them is the result. So for you, the big difference with group versus one-on-one is your cost structure because you're going to pay a coach relatively, let's call it the same, what you're going to pay them for option two or option one. So understanding the difference in what your margin is and if they can still get the same result with one to four versus one one, you might as well be doing one to four for all of them because it's going to be cheaper for you to do and you could likely charge the exact same price. So I think what I think the thinking on it is maybe a little wrong where like you need to understand the cost and I and I see what you're trying to do with small group versus onetoone but like they could both be the same cost and as long as you get the result for the client it's what they're paying for um at some level to deliver. Yes. But so I like your idea of organic too. I mean that is you're going to save 30 40 points on the bottom if you can get the lead flow but you need consistency around that. And if you don't have consistency around that, you likely need to go to paid or referral or partnership or whatever other 92 different traffic sources. But yeah, I mean I think so the goal is 50k a month, which is what a thousand no 100 people at your group coaching rate. Yeah, 100 people at your group coaching rate. I don't know. I can't do that math right now. I'm terrible at the zeros. Um but yeah, I mean that's totally feasible. 50k a month is not that not that crazy, especially for fitness. Um, so yeah, are the models viable? Weekly coaching, yes. While hiring other coaches, yes. Any other early red flags we should watch out for? Everything I said, plus probably 92 other things. But you can just start. You can just get people results and just begin. And then once you kind of like feel through this, and then just keep dropping questions in here with where you're at with it. But you need consistency around acquisition because churn is a real thing in fitness. What they get the if they get the results, if they don't get the result, they still churn. Um, so I would still I would focus you need some sort of consistent acquisition. It's a sales and marketing game. Um, as much obviously as fulfillment, but and then flywheeling with the results. And then again, I would really make sure that this niche that you're targeting is great, but like does it does it go through the whole company? Uh, not just in your marketing assets. Hopefully that was helpful. Next, if you had some if you had to start from scratch today, what would be your top three niches you go and do in the info space? Would it be fitness, something with strong backend, or something else? So, that's what I kind of answered up here for this, but I would go with something definitely with a strong backend. So, if I was to like literally go if I was today to be like, "Okay, cool. I'm going to stop working on this and go work on another one or like directly, it would be definitely in the higher ticket thing, it would be in something that has a massive backend. Massive massive." Um, I know guys that are in I don't want to like docks because they they're great, but they have a back-end play that is that could be millions of dollars like per person that comes in and pays them like five grand. And it's not everyone, but it's a portion of them. So like the blended number it's still it's crazy. It's like a thousand to one LTV uh to CAC and I mean they don't even have a CAC because it's organic. So I mean they do with content but so yeah I would go with something with a massive backend that is so again I use the example like insurance. I use the example like financial management pieces. is I know guys who crush it in that because they can still charge like 10 20 grand on the front for the the education, the info, the community, but then on the back when people go through partner like think of a Dave Ramsey for example like he has such a large partner network and such a large backend that he can it's just amazing. So I would go into that model. Um ours fitness has some but not not that crazy. I mean it's it's more of a it's more of a recurring play. There are some partnership plays depending on your niche. There are some other ways to monetize the back other than just stuff that you fulfill on um for sure. But yeah, I would definitely do that. I don't know other direct like top three specific niches necessarily off the top, but it would definitely be something with a strong back end. Struggling right now with show rates. How do you keep them above 50%. I have an entire video on the channel that's like how we got our se our show rates to 70 something%. Um our blended blended blended everything right now is like 5560. Um, but that includes cancels, that includes no shows, that includes reschedules. That's like literally every booking to every show. Um, the ones that come through setters. So, the the quick needle movers are make sure that the framing on the way in is correct. So, ask them before in the application on the booking like, you know, you're going to show up for this. You know, this is a call. If you do not show up for this, we will not talk to you ever again. Like some stuff around that. Then on the thank you page, it's going to be, you know, pop into your email. Make sure you confirm this thing. Watch the three-minute video that's framing about it. Have some like homework or something they need to do prior to the call. Have pre-objection blocks, which how much does this cost? Uh or, you know, is this expensive? The oh, what if this doesn't work for me or or how do I know what what even is this? Like anything that you have seen in your sales calls that come up as objections, try to get ahead of them and do pre-objection blocks. and then also have just a wall of testimonials that they consume prior to the call. We also are going to call them within the first five minutes of them booking. So, you're going to have an STR or a closer, whatever that reaches out to them either via text or phone to confirm the booking. If they do not confirm sometimes, and there are people, we've danced with this, but like you take them off the calendar completely. So, you just unconfirm them so someone else can book in their slot. Um, and then we also are going to do the reminders and I there's like 12 reminders and emails that come texts that come from different sources. They're all in the video that I posted. Um, and then the last one, what was the last one? Oh, the ad strategy. So, Jeremy Haynes, great great YouTube videos. He has an agency. I'm pretty sure it's an agency and like a mastermind, but he teaches the hammer them strat. So, you essentially are ramming ads at them uh up until like once they book before they get on a call. So, you have all these different ads that are queued up that show. So, you're basically just owning their feed uh with pre-objection block, with authority, with long form testimonials, all those stuff. So that's what we do. We do 5 to 600K a month in cash collected. Nice. And my sales team is built. My marketing team exists. My CS team exists. My admin ops team. Let's go. My main role as the founder at this time is simply controlling. I don't know what you're controlling. Checking sheets daily. And I still own the CMO role. So scripting and recording a bunch of ads every week and occasionally tweaking the funnel. So I assume you are the face or something similar. Uh, unless there are a bigger product uh product dev projects, my week is usually boring with little work hours, so I don't have much stuff to do. Is that normal? How much actual work are you doing at your level? Doing 15 to 30 million per year. Should it be a target to basically only sit in your office, look at a few sheets, occasionally improving the product with CS team, and run a few one-on-one meetings with team leaders every week sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I do something wrong because everyone seems to hustle 247. All right, first of all, I'm going to drink some coffee before this because this is a good one. So the everyone hustle 247 the me saying I'm working 16 hours a day in this season right now completely unnecessary. I I don't subscribe to it. I actually that's not true. I don't want to say it's unnecessary but I don't the hustle culture I agree there's a level of toxicity to it that is just unnecessary. Uh that portion. So I don't necessarily know what you mean when you say controlling things but like I get what you're saying where you're just like checking sheets and you're sitting in there. So there was an era in this where it was doing 2 three million a month and I was on four hours of meetings a week. Now we have other founders we have other sea level at that time and for a long time I was not necessarily in as much of an operational or handsin mode uh that I am now. what I'm doing now is much more groundwork and foundational work and you know for x amount of weeks has been ramping seale roles and has been like giving context and supporting with data and rebuilding systems and doing all these things around there that are call it like oneoff builds. So it's a one-off 16- hour day. It's not a oh now I have 16 hours of things to do every single day. When I also say that I've been doing this I've been doing YouTube stuff. I've been doing like I've been scattered all over the board and I'm not the best at time blocking and it looks like you are better at me than that which is 100% very easy probably to do to be better at me than this. So how much work am I actually still doing right now? It is positioning and making it so that we have the sea level and the management piece that what you're talking here they have where is it my main role so the CS team exists the admin ops the marketing team exists the sales team. So it's making sure for me that the next layers of this are scalable. so that they have the data they need, they have the automations, they have the system, they have all those things around them, they have the project management list that we operate out of. So right now it's like a big building of that because we want to make sure that we can scale with ease to the next one. So we're kind of like forecasting what the next issues are going to be and where things are, you know, where we need to hire where it hurts, where we need to change structure where it hurts, where things are messy in data or scale, automations that are going to break at scale. So it's really like a bunch of proactive work, but really I could work three or four hours a week right now and like everything would just run. It's just what I'm try I'm trying to work into the future of things. So this is great. I mean I don't it all depends on what your goal is. But if your goal is to sit in your office, look at a few sheets and improve the product like it just depends on how big you want to go because there are ways that right now you could be spending many hours a day building out entire back-end systems or ways to do this. You could be needlem mover on you could be needle mover on basically anything you choose. And for us, we just like to kind of like deep dive. We like to work and we probably overwork or overhustle and like kind of fake work sometimes for sure. I'll be the first to say it. Um but there are ways to develop and grow. If you want to double or triple that that you will be in proactive, you will be inside certain divisions and departments because if you want to double that could just be all LTV, so all backend. So you could just be with uh admin ops and CS for example and just hard pressing on what can you build? What is an entirely new product offering you can have to double on the back end. So you could be completely in there like you said your dev product dev projects. You could be on the front end try to get CAC cut in half. So how would you redo that completely? What are completely new funnel builds and structures? And again this is all unnecessary depending on your goal. If your goal is to just exist and do 5,600K a month and I don't know your margins, but like if that's great, like run it, you know, hire someone even to look at the sheets for you. I mean, at some level, um, not actually, but like, you know, you can have that. And then the question is, this is a big one that Dan Martell always talks about, which is like, buy back your time. Horoszi talks about it. It's amazing when you get to a place where you now have all this free time and you've gotten yourself out of it. I have done it. I have used it for the wrong things then, too. And that is what the big thing they say there is like if you're if you're making 200 bucks an hour now it makes sense on paper to hire somebody to do things that are $20 an hour roles like do your laundry and like make meals and do stuff like that. But the question is once you replace yourself from that now you're paying for those things. What are you doing with your now free time? And you have to do something that's more that's higher leverage and that continues to grow if that's your goal. There are a lot of people in this that'll just now travel and just do their thing. There are other people in this who go, "Okay, cool. Now that I have all this bandwidth, I can do even higher leverage things. I could have three of these companies. I could I could take this one to 5 million a month." And that's how we looked at it is the focus to do different things would be more difficult and probably hurt them all overall versus just scale ours aggressively high. We also have multiple partners. So, I don't know if you're a solo owner, but you know, the cash flow for someone who has partners in the business, multiple co-founders, um, you know, everyone makes their piece. So, the numbers have to be bigger for everyone to make the same kind of money you do. So, it sounds like you're in a great position and like congrats on what you've built. Um, another big one is we actually ran into this exact same issue where one of the co-founders was still the CMO and acquisition broke and it broke the entire company. Um, I'm not blaming at all. I'm just saying like because the CMO was not a person that was directly inside the org chart that was accountable to roles that was at the same layer of these kind of like other pieces where they bounce back and forth with sales and CS and you know were held accountable to standards. Uh it was internal to us as like the owners or leaders. Uh it failed and the rest of the company suffered massively and profit margins went to you know damn near zero on certain months and like it was not good. So, a full replacement would be this portion. Yeah. So, hopefully that makes sense. I would love if Yeah, just DM me and we can talk about this. Um, I think this is a good one. What is your process for grading calls to make sure every sales rep is staying compliant following scripts. Uh, for a long time it was just manual reviews um because we didn't have that many calls. Now we have whatever hundreds a day. So, we use AI tools. So, we use Zoom revenue accelerator on the back end. It has automated or we have created questionnaires or like checklists that review the calls with AI and then say if they did something or didn't and then also gives context to them on why it ranked it like that. So like is it in the beginning it's like one of the questions will be like did the uh did our sales rep set the uh intention or the agenda for the call and then it'll say yes or no but then under it'll say why it ranked it yes or no. So, it'll be like, "No, they started talking about cats within the first minute and then talked about them for 10 minutes and then it just kind of like made its way to the sales call and it's like it'll tell you why." So, that's one, but I know a lot of people actually just have spreadsheets that'll just go here and then it'll be like, "Did they do this, do they do this, do they do this?" And they have VA go through it or they just drop the transcripts in and feed into AI now is like the easier way. So, hopefully that's helpful. Um, and then the ones that get closed get like a super magnifying glass on them. The closed and loss because we do call reviews with sales management. we do call review. Like there's a lot of that. So there's eyes on these calls all the time. And now that we have setters and closers, they like dual review because a setter only gets paid when a closer closes. So it's like this game where there's a lot of accountability across each other. Hey Ryan, thanks for sharing so much valuable content. Quick context. I'm 21 and I've been running an info agency for uh two years. Generated a little over four million for clients. Nice. And your biggest bottleneck right now is sales. So my clients struggle to close. Okay. So it's sales inside your client businesses. Agency life. Uh, the real problem is I can't find any solid closers. I live in a small Scandinavian country and I only take 10% of profits. I can't afford to build or tra I can't afford to build or train a sales team for them myself. Yeah, you need to change that deal structure. It's just too much work for too little upside, so I'm torn. Do I go international, work with bigger clients who already have sales teams, and double down on what I'm good at, which is just volume. Uh, or do I stay in market, partner with deep, one to two clients, take ownership, and build everything from scratch, sales included. Would love your perspective. Um, I don't know that it necessarily needs to be one of these one or the other or even these two, but stay in local market. I assume you mean then you just are right now doing it for Scandinavian country. Uh, there are agencies that you can hire that fully do sales. They take 20% and they crush. I don't know if they're within your market might be the issue for that. Um, but yeah, I mean, if you're doing high ticket, you're going to need a sales team. So, you either need to create the team and then I would change your deal structure because this is this is not good um for what you're trying to do. So, if you're going to start building all these pieces for them entirely and they aren't doing it on their own, you need likely larger than 10%. Um, especially because you're going to be hiring a sales team that's going to eat into profits and then it's just going to like make you make less at some level. It's it's it's going to help scale, but like not. So, we talked to a guy on I I talked to a guy on the on YouTube, Ahmed. I think it's the second video in there, but he does this for trading communities, and they take a percentage. They basically do what you're saying. So, they like do all this. They do will basically help with everything. So they'll help with the product, they'll help with the structure, they'll help with the marketing sale, they'll do all of it. And for that, they get a percentage of actually rev share instead of a net profit share. So I don't know your deals, but I would do that or look at that option. And then this go international and work with bigger clients. Like yeah, if you have the skill set of being able to do what you're doing here for generating clients like all this cash, you can find other clients that already have these other pieces built and you don't have to just like try and like square peg round hole or whatever it is where you are trying to just stay within your local market. I mean, if it's a hot niche and you own it and you know it, but like all you have to do is sales, like solve for the sales and change your deal structure. But if they can only get so big because of the TAM, and I don't know what that is, but I would Yeah. I mean, you definitely have the skill set. if you can do this, I would assume uh to be able to go international or, you know, next country over. I don't know exactly how, you know, all that works with how you guys do it. I know there's a lot of guys who like crush in Germany. I know there's a lot of guys who crush in uh France, but yeah, I would look at that. So, one of those two. I I agree with your thinking around this though. So, hopefully that was helpful. And then same thing, you can DM me if you have more questions. How to frame a front-end course in a way that gets a three to five conversion to a high ticket. Is there a framework you use to build these front ends or is it more of a back-end setter closer thing? Uh, yes, it's both. Um, so a big issue that a lot of people will have is they will create a low ticket that can sell, but the low ticket does not lead them to a back a backend. So you can sell a thousand low tickets, but if none of them or if the product itself either cannibalizes, is completely not it's not congruent with the backend, it is never going to convert into a high ticket. It's never going to ascend. So for us, what you're going to do, and depending on if you already have a product or not, you essentially want to go in the direction of what you're selling up here and peacemeal it in very small chunks. So for example, for our thing, um, we have, you know, backend that's this onetoone coaching to get XYZ result in the whatever. Over here in the front, we're going to sell little pieces around the messaging. So here is how you do it in the nutrition portion. And here is a little nugget on how you do it in the mindset or the um menopause or the whatever little bucket that is a micro course, an info thing that is packed with value, no doubt. But where does the real value come from? Uh you know, where do all of our main results come from? Is you not just doing it yourself and trying to do it from, you know, this course and other little like YouTube videos and online? You need a onetoone coach. You need the personalization. So you need them to be able to stair step. And then also for us to get this like I talked to a guy on this the other day that has a 50% from uh ascension rate but he's selling a mid ticket not a low ticket. So, when you're saying front-end course, there's a lot of ways you can do this, but I know guys who sell 297 course up to 2K course direct to cart and then from there they will ascend them via this kind of model where they book in like a quick start implementation call, get on the phone with a closer and then uh so they talk to a setter and then they get set with a closer and then the closer will sell them on something that's 7K, 10K, 20K. And he was even saying live, he's like, "Yeah, we have a 30 to 50% ascension rate for us because it's so low ticket and there's such a discrepancy where it's, you know, under 50 bucks and then over, you know, 5K." Ours is, yeah, closer to those numbers, 3 to five. Uh, and the math works really well for us because that keeps us, I mean, that's that's a low CPA. If you keep your cost to acquire a front-end purchase down uh, pretty low, then that those numbers work out really well. So, it just kind of depends. But you do, if you're focused on ascension, you want this. Some of the big guys in the space I know that do 12 15 million a month do this exact model they do a two a 2k then they book in a setter call setter talks to them for an hour goes through everything and it's basically like yeah but the real way to get results more or less is like to do it one-on-one or to get help with it and it's that classic like do-it-yourself over here information and I I would even go a step further and chunk out the do-it-yourself because you don't want to cannibalize your offer either because that's like an issue we have or we're going to have. We were selling an info product that was a thousand bucks or 1,500 bucks at one time. Uh that was everything a toz like the craziest deep dive of things and then we had coaching on the back and it's like the only difference was that you got a coach and personalized but like all the information was in there and it kind of cannibalized it both because the prices were too close and then also because like the the uh delivery the value like the the difference between them was not large enough. So you don't want to cannibalize and then you want to make sure that it is in the direction that there's a straight line that you can it makes sense why someone would buy this who would want this has to be the same person that is the ICP for both those structure I have no idea what you mean but I'm attempting to be more structured that's what I'm doing with all the ops and the company right now and then also with personal I talk about it a lot but my time blocking and personal structure is right now I need to be much better at that and I'm doing a terrible job currently run my own beat B main offer is selling payment terminals with a few different upsells that focus on digital presence marketing like SEO, Google Ads, website overhaul, and an online ordering delivery system. My team is currently hovering around 100K a month in total revenue across all sources, but my biggest issue I'm running into is lead generation as all my clients have been acquired through to word of mouth. Any recommendations on what to look out for and resources? Okay, so you're crushing and your issue is lead genen and is consistency around this. So this is just an all this is referrals, this is partnerships, this is organic content, this is paid, right? And there's nine other ones, I'm sure, but you just need consistency around that. So whether it's referrals and and usually what this comes down to is having like a really solid product offer and as long as you have that, all of those work. So if you know you need to be able to differentiate, I don't know if that's something that's like stands out strong as a differentiated product, but referral systems are the best by far. um by far because they have the highest show rates, highest close rate, the highest pre-rust rate, all those things because they come from someone. Organic is probably next up. Partnerships are really solid. If someone already has your customer and then will you can pay them 2,000 or whatever your CPA is, call it $2,000. Someone else has your customer and they're like they sign up for XYZ shopping cart thing and they now need a payment terminal and you can partner with them and you pay them 2,000 bucks for everybody they sell send over or percent or whatever like an affiliate deal. That's really good for consistency if their business is consistent. You're kind of like two steps in. Organic content is great. Uh whether you have it for paid or not or or whether you have it instead of paid or not. Uh I would do organic content and build a brand around that because then when you do start to run paid if you want to, the organic content exists. You have a moat. People can consume it. Um paid just comes down to the math. So, I don't know what it's going to cost you. And I would have to understand this model a little bit more. But you'd want to create an offer that you can run ads to that get solid click-through rate, that get solid clicks, that get solid information, you know, information form fills, uh, or booked calls, and then you just have to do the math. So, that one's kind of gray area, but like there's a lot of ways to go about this. All you need is consistent lead flow. Uh, Horoszi's book, uh, $100 million leads, which is is probably just like read that book and you'll have 12 ideas. B2B solarreneurs that work with small businesses, how to scale and what to look for. Is it even something worth doing? B2B soloreneur that work with small businesses. How to scale. Um, yeah. So, I think what you mean is I actually don't know what you mean really, but I think you're just like a solo guy that does service work for small businesses and how to scale. That's kind of vague, but how to scale is doing more of the same, building team to fulfill on it. you do generally have an issue like if you did all like snow removal companies for example small business I don't know if you're doing multiple niches but that's hard because they have different seasonality they have different struggles they have different everything um so if you're doing one business call it snow removal again there's major seasonality and stuff like that there's also like a really high churn rate of who goes out of business or how high they can scale so you almost need more volume of actual businesses you work with instead of being able to just go really deep with certain clients you need a lot of them so there's Just a lot of factors there. Um, is it worth doing long term? Yeah. I mean, you can have great business with that. You can have high recurring MR. You can have a lot of things. Um, yeah. So, I don't know. I don't fully understand that. So, maybe submit another one for next week. That's a lot deeper context. Love the videos. How do you come up with your video ideas? I get that you talk from your experience. What would you recommend that someone who's an intermediate level business? Uh, my video topics are terrible. My I have very little search. I have very little things that stand out. any YouTube pro, any anything is like your ideation blows, your titles suck, your thumbnails are worse, um your intros are bad. Like I have not removed myself as a cog from the machine to like change my strategy really other than to be like, "Oh, cool. I'm going to start doing interviews with people um or whatever you want to call those, podcasts, interviews, just conversations. But I come up with video ideas basically by looking at overarching on what I'm doing on a daily or weekly basis. So like right now I'm obviously heavy on this operations stuff and department levels and management. So like I'm talking more about that. In the beginning we were trying to fix marketing a lot. So we were talking about the different funnels all these different stuff. We were launching the different math behind those. Um so thus far for the last two months it's basically just been me sharing what is currently happening in the business and what's currently happening now. And then I also had the whole you know first month basically where it was me able to just share what I'm do like what we have done. You know I can talk about I could talk about any of these things. I talk about an opt-in page for 20 minutes. I can talk about the VSS. Like I could go page by page of a funnel. I can do a full funnel overview. I can talk about the automations behind it. I can talk about specific flows of the automation. Like you can just go as deep as you want in each one of these depending on how much you're willing to share. But I think the where I've kind of landed that doesn't take a lot of prep is like just what's happening now. It's so fresh on the brain. I can create a loom in 10 minute or a miro in 10 minutes and go through what we're actually doing or like structurally and then I can just yap for 10 20 30 minutes easily because it's just so fresh in the brain. But I feel like that would be difficult if you're not doing things on a daily basis. Um which kind of goes back to my like dumb I'm working 14 16 hour day thing. Like I don't need to be necessarily. I'm just kind of scattered and it's you know a little a little gray area and like choppy. So hopefully that's helpful. But intermediate level business I don't I'm back and forth in this. Like I didn't share any of this. We're technically an intermediate level. Like we only do whatever a few million a month. Like I know guys who do 10 and 50 and you know I don't I know guys who do 10 in this space and there are guys who do like 40 50 in this space and more and other spaces that do hundreds and like why did I choose now to share? I don't know when it makes sense to or not but yeah that's kind of my view. What's in your crypto portfolio? Uh I have had so much ETH for so long and it's just miserable honestly. That's my simple answer for you. I have like six or seven things probably, but and like you know 92 wallets and all this stuff, but I just have fun with it. It's however much in ETH and then I'll do memecoin stuff that's fun. So I do have a large amount of soul just for sport, but that's about it. I don't really do stuff like that. I've just lost more than I've won. I've had deal opportunities that I've said no to and then gone and bought just NFTs that have gone to zero and then at the same time those deals in like real life have gone on to like 100x like three times. So, I'm not a person you should ask about my uh investing skill in either active or passive. How do you think about the following team comp amount questions? How do you figure out what's competitive? What percentile band are you generally targeting? How much are you willing to deviate from different calibers of candidates? How often do employees have their compact just change? There's a good one. Um, all right. So, how do you figure out what's competitive? There are so many tools you can do this, but you know, everything from glass door to I think, yeah, glass door, I think. Um, glass door to there's so many ways online to just find out what's competitive. You're also going to ask them what they want to make, which is going to be an interesting indicator of where they land. Uh, what percentile band are you targeting? High. Generally, we almost exclusively have like North America t uh talent and that's the most expensive to my understanding for what we're doing, which is also not the smartest thing. Like you have people like Iman who talk about all his global talent and he'll get positions that are fantastic that are like ride or dies for a third of what I will and 1099 depending on how you you know it's structured. Ours is all W2. So we over I don't want to say overpay in terms of like but it's just higher in compared to global markets. Um, how much are you willing to deviate for different calibers of candidates? A lot examples like strong leaders. We have put in place some KPI structures that are that do protect us but will make them exorbitant amounts of money. So, I know other people who, you know, their sea level will never make over 300 grand a year. Um, I know people who have been almost poached from our or not almost but have been requested to be poached from our company to go work at some big people's uh companies that you would know the names of and the comp plans are 250 350 you know to run larger stuff than we do and ours sometimes pay more than that which is like just goes to show like it's just a skill we haven't developed to where we're either hiring because the other thing is the internet marketing culture and like the online marketing this whole space like everyone thinks that they deserve to be a millionaire for their skill set just because they're in the space and it's like that is what it is. Um, but I don't necessarily I mean it's just not true. It's like if you're not the owner and you don't have the risk associated and you're not doing all the other pieces and you are running just fulfillment or just CS or just product or or I'm sorry or just marketing or just whatever like generally speaking unless it's a very large company that you're not getting to those seven figure ranges. um unless you're one of the huge drivers and then again it has to be KPI direct so the company continues to make money uh and makes more money per because if not it's just like you know that that team will make more than ownership and then it's like okay well then they should go have their own thing and then because you're just you're just running a business to make them more money and everyone needs to win is like a big thing here like and our people have been paid very well very well um and our team is yeah so we definitely pay on the higher band but how often are having employees how how often are employees having their comp packages changed. We try not to do it that often. I mean, if you're asking for like raises and stuff like that, it's incremental. It is not super structured right now. We are baking in things on like fulfillment side right now that are uh 10-year recognition style thing that are paid out in one-time bonuses at the end of that term. So, instead of just raising the floor, we're doing, you know, after three years, after five years, you get this spiff that hits on that uh on that anniversary essentially. Um so, that's for that one. And then compense changes, there are some increases that will happen on kind of some of the more standardized roles. And then when things break the KPIs, we have to redo them. So sales comp, for example, can break them because you didn't know what this and this could happen at these close rates or this volume. You run that for two months and you're like, we're paying too much or we're paying too little. Like that happens. um some things around marketing. If it's like a CPA driver and you set it all up and then all of a sudden it just blows through the metrics you put on there because something happened in sales or something happened with, you know, a partnership deal or something, you need to change them. But only on stuff like that do we try to do that um or make changes. That was a good one. How do you push a digital course using just organic on Twitter? I have no idea. I'm not good at Twitter. Uh been selling on Twitter since 2001. You Okay, you're going to know better than I am. uh with the 3 to 5k a month, but since Elon bought it and added a four page went down 5x and now barely scraping by. Niche is dating so tons of third world followers. Tried an ebook, a free ebook, but only in an Indians and other countries. Signed up with the same free Telegram group. Before Elon took over, I had 3 to 500 clicks a day. At the moment, I average 150 with 40 to 50 tier one. Low six figures on X at the moment. That's But that means nothing since Algo is screwed. Yes. It just sounds like you don't have an audience or like a you don't you no longer have you relied on the algo of one single platform that changed its rules and now you're there. So you your your clicks basically only went in half but your rev dropped way more than half which or your average profit dropped way more than half. So yeah, you just I mean you understand what you need to solve for. You need to solve for clicks and views. So I don't know if you know your economics well enough to know what you can pay. I don't know if I've never run ads on X directly. I've heard people talk about it, but I know that people do it and some people have really good results with it. So maybe there's a play where you can do some version of that, even if it's just paying to show up in front of your own audience that you have because what it sounds like is your stuff is no longer showing for because for you, you would think extends and gets you more reach. So creating content and stuff that actually is good and gets the clicks that you're talking about versus just XYZ that if you're posting the same stuff and you're now getting a less result, it's like you need to post new stuff to get a different result if the algo changed and is no longer in your favor or you need another acquisition source. So instead of doing it just organic and you do paid instead of or you can do, you know, boosts and people are in my DMs like, "Oh, you want these shout outs or these retweets for this thing?" Like I don't do any of that, but I'm sure people do it and crush it. So, I don't know enough about this, but yeah, you just need more consistency around this with the right quality people. So, if it's not, if you're no longer getting, you know, at some level you're getting shadowbanned for your own audience, uh, or you're just not showing to them, you need to either have better content so you do show to them or other people is probably just the easiest answer. Or you need to boost it in some way to get to that audience. Um, or like you're saying, like pushing them to different platforms. So, you grow this on Instagram, you grow this on YouTube, you grow this on other platforms. So, just get your lead flow up. So, a lot of people have asked about that today, but it's, you know, consistency around lead flow, paid partnerships, affiliate, organic. There's like a lot of options, but you just need to master one. How would you recommend someone become a killer at Facebook ads? Because besides trial and error, uh, trial and error, just kidding. Um, but there are tons of guys on YouTube, so many. And then there's a bunch of people with paid. A lot of people now with the paid have like communities and groups. I'm sure there's ones on I know there's ones on schools that are like Facebook ad mastery. There's different layers within that. It's guys who do physical products, there's guys who do info, there's guys who do lead genen. So, you just got to kind of pick your lane and then find those people on whatever platform and start following them, consuming their free stuff. And then if you want to pay the $50 a month or 500 a month or whatever, I mean, our CMO is kills kills it at Facebook ads in info specific and he still to this day will be talking. He'll be like, "Oh, you got to go pop to a workshop." And he gets on with a bunch of other guys that are in the trenches running ads still on a daily basis. What's working now? I talked about that lead genen guy earlier who crushes it. They do a weekly call where they all talk and you know one week it's like oh yeah or not one week but like yeah I guess one week someone will bring up oh these you know bidcap CBO this this and this is like really crushing for us right now. I heard it from this ecom guy and then everyone starts doing it and then for two months they're all crushing it on that because for whatever reason that's what the algo is doing or like whatever. So yeah, Facebook ads is all-encompassing. It's um it's creative. It's the media buying. It's the understanding the economics. um when you get to scale. So, I would just do that. Surround yourself with the right people, consume the free stuff, and then move into the paid stuff. Daily update. Hope that was helpful for you guys. Um www.rronclub.comdoc has all these videos. I'm on day 72 in a row of doing these. I am a bit tired today. It is early on a Saturday, so I apologize if the energy is down, but we keep moving forward. So, hit me up on X. Uh if you guys have any questions, I do these weekly, so drop them in here. as you can see how much easier it is for me to answer when you guys give a little more context like this. So, if you can do this uh and fill out this request, it's the easiest way. It's so hard for me to find stuff in Instagram and and XDMs that are like this that are questions like this. It's easy if you're just like here's my stats. Here's what I've done and here's where I either am asking a question or want to, you know, do something. But, this is the easiest way is to submit the form. So, that's all. Um and then our daily update. I'm going to do a more official one of these soon, but we are we're cooking along. So, we're in the two millions this month already. um mid mid twos already. So, we're having a big uptick from the things that we changed with marketing and sales and we're just sprinting. We're just full full running. So, uh I will have a great update for you at the end of May. Um that will be super helpful and talk about what we did right, what we did wrong, how we solved our bottleneck, and hopefully be very helpful. So talk to you guys soon.

# 5 systems that took us from $0 to $73M | EP72
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRkQjpIWOEc

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the five systems that took us from 0 to $73 million in total cash collected. I'm going to walk through each one of these systems and their two subsystems. And I promise you that if you watch this entire video, you are going to learn which one of these systems is currently holding you back from massive scale. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done over 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No guru, no course, no nothing. Everything on the channel I'm sharing did work for us, did not work for us, or is something we are actively doing. And I'm doing all of this to find top talent, opportunity, and build a network of cool people doing cool So, let's get into it. So, to start it off, we're going to think of everything like a funnel. And we are going to start with our marketing system. Okay? So, for us, everything that we have run almost exclusively has been paid. So, we're going to go through the different channels and we are going to go through the different funnels that we have used. Okay? This is day 72, I believe, of me making videos in a row every single day where I have tons of videos on the channel where I break these down immensely. But we're just going to talk through the overall systems. So, thinking of everything as a funnel, the first thing you need to do is get people to talk to. Okay? So, before you can sell them, before you can service them, before you can charge them a dollar, you need to get them to you. Okay? So, for us, the channels that we used almost exclusively was Meta. Okay? Now, it's easiest one in my opinion to get on to. A lot of people now do organic and these other we did exclusively paid. So for us paid on meta was the easiest and then we also did um Google and you know on the back end for branded search which you can look up how to do branded search basically for your keywords because once you start running enough paid or even organic on enough channels people are searching your name and you want to be the first one to pop up. So these are the core channels we went into and then the different funnel types. For us the first 71 million of this was using a VSSL opt-in funnel. So, that's just going to be your name, email, uh, to opt in for a free training. They're going to watch a VSSL. After the X amount into the VSSL, they're going to click a button to apply to get on the phone, and then they are going to book a call, get on the phone, and purchase. Okay, so we optimized everything for a call funnel that was frontloaded with an opt-in and VSSL. As this has transitioned and changed for this last couple million and what we're building for this next scale, we're trying to take this to a couple hundred million a year. Uh, first stop is 100. But for us, we have diversified and have multiple funnels now like low ticket ascension. We have a direct to VSSL. So basically headline VSSL application to book a call and other things. Channels for us though have stayed consistent. We are talking about leaning in more into organic and I'm kind of on the prowl right now to find somebody to do this for us because we have so much content but really for us first click has almost never been uh from organic videos and almost exclusively from paid. All of our organic acts as like retargeting piece of it. So once you have people in the system and I'm going to go back through this and we're going to go through iterations. Once you have them in there is your sales system. So for us everything for us has been setters and closers. And actually again back to that first 71 million was just closers. So we built a very large team of closers. Um we've had upwards of like 354 at one time which isn't necessarily the large part but we have had hundreds in general because we've been running this for years. So we have had iterations of this. We've had different offers. And that's where this kind of comes in between all three of these is a really big thing which is your offer. So for us, which we'll get into in this next one, at one time we were selling kind of a mid-t product over the phone and then we went to selling something higher ticket which develops a different type of closer and requires a different type of closer who can sell that. So there is basically the skill of the person to sell something and then there's like the belief in the product around it. So for us when we started we brought closers in that were customers of the product. So when we did that, we brought them, we would basically post inside the group. We would hire them from there and then teach them the skill of how to sell, teach them the CRM, the tech skills to do the actual job. But they already came with such a high belief level that it just worked. So I think a lot of people when starting can do this. I know a lot of people who do this with their actual coaches inside their program, their community managers. Um they're your initial customers. They get the result. They have the highest belief. Um and it's definitely a really good way. Setters was such an untapped thing that everyone talked about that we never did and has now benefited us massively. So setters sit everywhere inside of our system. So at a larger scale, you are going to have basically drop off and break points everywhere inside your funnel. You're going to have people who apply but don't book. You're going to have people who book but no show and 92 other places where you're going to have their phone number, their email, something that you can contact them with that a closer generally speaking is not going to do. Okay? So, you do have full stack closers and all that, but for us, we were dedicating our closers to just close. And the setters were non-existent, but the setters now have come in and reached into those pockets and basically have hot lead lists. They claim different leads and they dial them and get them back on the calendar, which overall will bring your if you're using paid, it'll just be more efficient. So, if you're using paid, it'll drive your cost per down. You do have to pay the setting team, but the math works out really, really well if you have a strong team. So, for us, this was a really uh efficient system for us to use. We never actually did direct to cart style stuff which you'll see a lot of people do. From there you move into your fulfillment system and of your fulfillment in my example info/coaching. That's my keyword and I'm I'm owning it. So info coaching for us in the beginning we sold initially a $27 a month app that was direct to cart. So I know I said we didn't do direct to cart but we really never got too much steam with that. We got up to around 100 grand a month, but very, you know, razor thin margins because we were playing an MR LTV to CAC range game that we did not understand. We had no ascension ladder and we didn't understand it. So, the first actual step into us making money and how we got into how we got to our first million- dollar month actually was selling info over the phone. So, we implemented this system where we ran paid mainly through Facebook, I think at that time only exclusively Facebook to a VSSL opt-in funnel. We only had closers initially. we were taking sales calls um then we hired team then we trained team then we managed team uh and then eventually we got closer managers and I'll go into that when I circle back through here um but for us we were selling an info product now the beauty of info product and it really is the offer that I'm kind of trying to pull through here because that is the most important part you hear stuff he has great videos on this on the different scales of what you hit and his books are structured in a way that the first one you learn is how to build an offer because it's the most important thing the next one is how you get lead flow the next likely is how you sell it and scale right there's there's different layers to this. But the offer that pulls through here for us that we were doing was an info product. So they got login access to a course, the very classic course access, group coaching and a Facebook group. Okay, different people use different platforms, platform agnostic. It does not matter. You can use circle, you can use you can use school, you can use whatever, but the delivery of it and how they actually get the results is done through information mainly in this example. Okay. So this is how we got to a million a month. We did 10 million and then 12 million I want to say or or or the other way around. I can pull the exacts but uh the two years prior and then we shifted our offer to be coaching. So the offer for the sales team was selling went from uh you know $1,1500 offer up to a $7,000 plus dollar offer that they were selling and actually it was a little bit lower but we have scaled up now to where it's $78,000 and that is more capital intensive because you now have a coaching team. So the fulfillment cost is higher but the offer is also like the the sales process is higher as well. So that took an entire different system up here. You needed more nurture. You needed because someone's sitting on their couch that just applies and then gets on the phone is much more it's easier for someone to buy something that's $1,000 than $7,000. So the funnels evolved. The depth of consumption involved. The closers need to have a higher skill set or just a higher belief level. And the issue for us was all these closers had only bought the $1,000 thing. So they didn't have as much belief in the $7,000 thing. So the total evolution of this as this transitioned and then selling the coaching and fulfilling on the coaching. So, we actually scaled up to where we had 70 coaches. We still have 70 coaches that fulfill on this at a onetoone level. Now, all of these have 19 other things under them. And again, I'm going to loop back around here and kind of go through these. But for the closing side, it was just those. And for the coaching side, it was 70 onetoone coaches. There are different types of fulfillment. There's group coaches. There are mastermind and onetoone level where it's actually just you doing the coaching. I like to think of the coaching ladder and like as a time and resource allocation. So the highest lever or not the highest lever opposite the highest that you can charge and the highest that likelihood of someone to get a result what someone's willing to pay for the most generally speaking is one-on-one with the guru the expert the person who is giving the info. The next layer is group coaching of that person. So instead of you having to work onetoone with someone for 50 grand or 100 grand instead you're working with multiple people in group setting. So you have a group call calendar and they all get on where you answer multiple questions. Also generally speaking you're in the in the community and answering stuff there. The next layer is onetoone with a coach and that's what the model we moved to. So you have now you have actual costs instead of your time. You now no longer have to do the coaching but you have to pay four coaches. So coaches then are a cost on the on the P&L that you have to understand and manage on your on your costs. Then the next layer from there is group coaching. So you have onetoone with you, group with you, then you have onetoone with a coach and then group with a coach. Okay? And the different ones have different costs both in terms of time and actual dollars. Okay? So that's how we moved to this one. That's how we got to our first $3 million month and then stayed around there. We actually we got to 3.7 was our peak month and then all of our acquisition broke because we broke this part of the system which again I'll loop back around to from there you have your tech system. This is where things start to kind of go out of order because the tech is underlying all of this as is this next pink one down here is an underlying factor that touches every single part of this but is critically important. So at almost all the way up until the last year or so, so call it 50 million or so in total cash collected. I had built all the tech on all the marketing side, the data side, the sales team, everything side. So the two core ones that I bucketed out are automations and reporting. So we are super automationheavy and at scale I think a lot of people should be. We're almost automationheavy to a fault and anytime that we had to build something, anytime that we were trying to scale into something, I found a way to automate it. Now, the issue with this is I almost found a way how to do it uh that was almost a duct tape style solution. So, we were creating automations that would do lookups in here and then find this and whatever just to get it live. And they are scalable, but when you stack too many of those on top of each other, it becomes like a really big mess. And we are actually trying to unwind this right now and build out new data systems and automation flows because we want to get to these next levels. And we know that it will work at scale, but it's just messy. which is too messy for what they call tech debt is going to carry with us when if we fix this now it'll be a cleaner scaling reporting absolutely huge. So reporting is going to be on your data. So automations are going to be things that someone has to automate that someone would manually have to do that you're going to come in and automate as simple as someone opts in you want to send them an email or a text as intense as you want to automate your sales team commission tracking. Uh you want to automate your cash flow management. You want to automate your everything you can possibly imagine, your deal flows, your your uh text reminders before things, your um hiring uh pipelines, anything you can imagine, you can automate. And now you can even do it more so with the tools like NAN that exist. Reporting is how you look at that data and when you look at that data, how that drives behavior and changes decisions. Okay, so this is huge and this is something we were extremely strong at. uh yes it was duct taped together but we were extremely strong at our reporting and always had access to our numbers even if we knew that they were within a 5% margin we would operate based on them because they were numbers that were important for us to scale into and to know that we could scale into okay so at this level and this scale again like I just said we are reworking the entire tech system where our data is stored source of truth all of that um but the reporting ability we've had on things like cash flow marketing stats sales stats fulfillment and uh both in fulfillment on terms of like financials and billing as well as like customer success, NPS scores, stuff like that. We've always had these. They've just been kind of messy, just pushed together and just like not the cleanest. So, this is something we're completely rebuilding right now, but has been extremely important for us to be able to scale. And people system again another one that just underlies all of this. Every single one of these at some level touches a person that is either running them in the actual role or managing them. Okay. So for us, hiring and management are the two core. So we have done a very good job of getting high quality talent. We have not always had such a we have not always been able to do that and that comes through a lot of things and again all of these have 19 things under them. I'm just going to point out two of them to keep this simple, easy, and help you identify maybe a place in your business that you're stuck at. Um, but for hiring, there's how you pay them, there is where you find them, there is where they at in their career journey, how much experience do they have. There are so many things on this, but we have now optimized to where we're a size through this stuff, for example, through creating YouTube content and getting out there a little bit more. We've found a lot of top talent in the online business, uh, info coaching space, marketing sp like in those niches. We found a ton of quality people. I have entire videos where I talk about this on how if you want to find a copywriter versus if you want to find an HR director, you have to look in different pools. If you're recurring hiring for something like a salesperson versus if you're hiring for an HR director, again, that's more of a one-off position. And then management. This is something we are actively working on. We are no way pros at any of this and I hope none of this comes off as ego look at us is the exact way to do it. This is just our experience of how we are bucketing our systems and our departments. And for management, we are getting to the level now where we essentially have a sea level. We're actually peeling back on people maybe that were at an operational level that really are kind of mid-level managers, but at our size, we're the highest level of managers. And now with the new levels and scale we're taking it, we are going to have, you know, multiple layers of management. In an example, we have, you know, chief of people under that. We have a CS manager that has CSC's, uh, customer success coordinators, billing, uh, billing support, like all these different pieces. We have in our coaching department, we have chief of product that then has um the basically mid-level like pod leaders of coaching and then the actual coaches in sales. We're going to have sal. So, we're getting to the point now where we have these multi-layers and management is becoming critical and the ability to manage projects, manage people and understand their entire department and their P&L is huge. So, if we zoom out a little, let's talk through some examples on where your bottleneck maybe is. So, I just talked to I've talked to a bunch of people in the last week or so and talked about kind of where their business is at and a kid I just talked to right before this was talking about how he wanted to grow his business. We talked and he said, you know, he's basically at 50k a month and I said, "All right, well, where's what's broken? Can you get more leads today or can you sell more people today? If you sold those people, would you break?" And he was at a point where he's doing a bunch of organic marketing that is both coming from referrals, which is kind of different. Um, and then organic marketing where he actually does organic marketing. So, he puts uh puts out content on YouTube, acts, all these places, gets a ton of uh impressions, gets a ton of likes, and then also gets people in his DM that are interested, me being one of them, right? So, I get to talk to him through that. I said, "Okay, so is it consistent for you is the first thing. What channels are you using? And then, how are you converting them?" Because for me, it was messy. I'm bouncing around all over. I can't get through on the calendarly thing. Like, the entire front end of this to get people to where they could even be sold was kind of broken. So, yes, he might have the lead flow, but his funnel and his way to get them to the next step in the in the situation is is not good. So, that was the first thing I was like, at least clean that up. You might not be bottlenecked there because you're still getting them through to sales, but it's something you can easily clean up. The next part was sales. I popped on with him. He was the founder. He's the owner. And again, he's doing good numbers. He's got great margins. He's doing 50k a month. Like, he's just slanging. But his sales system was a little choppy, right? And it was him on this. And then he was trying to share a dock and do this. And I told him I was like the next scale for you is if you want to because his goal was freedom and that was a big thing too we talked about was what is your goal and for him it was he wanted freedom he wanted freedom he wanted to make X dollars and kind of have like a fun company and I love it right he wanted to do business the right way is what he said so for a sales system I said eventually you are going to need this where you know you have all these people in your DMs so whether that's a closer setter hybrid or you have a setter over here that goes through your DMs for you so you're not over there setting your own calls and then instead of closing your own calls you have these so Right now, he may have, call it, 80% margins or something because he's running lean. Now, he's going to pay 10 or so percent here. This shouldn't cost much more because he's not going to do paid advertising, which generally speaking is anywhere from depending. Some people have crazy numbers, but it could be 10% and normally it's around 30% depending, right? Again, that's a 3x roz. So, you spend $100 to make 300ish. It depends on a lot of things. But, so through there, he would then replace himself from the sales process. And I said, "Okay, now if you sold a hundred people a week, what would break over here?" And he's like, "Everything, right? But if we sold five or 10, not that much. He knows the next hire and fulfillment for him. His is a service delivery, so something different than what we did for info and coaching. He would need another, you know, couple VAS that would do or editors more so that are kind of VAS. And then he would need uh like a basically like a middle-le manager that did reviews to make sure it was quality work before it went back out to the client. and he said we could do you know another 10 or 20 clients which is with just one more person which is amazing right because that means that his cost to fulfill only goes up a little bit in his team over here in order to scale to the next layer I said what is this system like and he's operating on Google docs and over here and over there and like this is something that you can kind of get away with depending for a while but it just makes things so much more efficient like he knows his numbers right now but does he know them at scale does he know the response times of things does he know um is he automating out Like they said they were automating some pieces, but as AI continues, are they automating thumbnail generation? Are they automating like all these other pieces of the puzzle that they could be unlikely right now, but this is something that you kind of always want to iterate on. You don't need to go full bore into, but you want to make sure it's efficient and lean. And then people, which again ties into all of these. So making sure that you have the best people that are aligned for your product for closers, that you have management over them. That's likely you at that scale that does that. Okay. Now, another person I talked to, this one's a little more interesting, but I talked to somebody that has massive amount of organic following, but has absolutely like no sales. Okay, so they are using a direct to cart system instead. Actually, let's use let's use another one that's more info and coaching. So, I talked to somebody the other day. Um, again, I have so much info. It's amazing. I love it when you guys message in and I get to just look at other businesses and numbers and models. Like, it's cool. I learn so much from it and then I get to think about things like this for our business. But I talked to one that I again hired again. So I heard about them through I was trying to hire someone as a developer kind of like an automation AI person for us that was also a developer and they said, "Oh, this is the company I came from." And I said, "Oh, I don't want to pay the company. I'd rather pay you direct." And he said, "No, you got to check them out." So I go to their website. I organically got there through a referral. I see that they have a little bit of stuff over here for organic. Their funnel was very simple. It was just an application. Book a call. I go to do so and the pages aren't loading properly. I email I get a thing that says click here for the thank you page. It's not. So again, more optimizations around this portion. I then go and book a call and I don't get the thank you page. I don't get any videos. I don't get any like pre-frame. So I email and ask them for uh a bunch of like case studies, anything you can send me. Send me everything before our call. I get nothing. I still am about to show up for this call. 10 minutes earlier before the call. They send me an email and it says, "Oh, check out the testimonial." It's like a oneliner. and I click on it and it had just been uploaded to YouTube prior and it's them on the call and they had just sent me a testimonial. They had just uploaded but I got on with them and because their product was so good that I ended I was like this is exactly what we need. This is exactly where we are at with our tech system and where we feel pain and they had the solution for it. So even because these other systems weren't good if they want to grow they need to optimize these but their fulfillment system is so good they just get referrals left and right. So it solves for this. They're just doing the closes because it's big ticket item. And now their fulfillment style drops through these grouping of calls basically to learn and get up to date on everything. And then they have a developing team on the back end. And they know their costs to a tea. They're very automated. They're very efficient which is their entire tech system. They are a tech company. So this is like completely forward. They know every number. They have every automation built and they have great people. Okay. So one of these is holding you back in your business. I 100% promise you it is holding you back. And this is kind of back to my whole bottleneck theory that I make videos on in other ones, but essentially it can be a cra a a traffic channel you need to crack. And to zoom out again, this is my opinion of things is how we're currently bucketing things based on how our leadership is and how we're trying to manage things across. With that being said, Horoszi, all these other guys have much larger businesses, have done this many more times over, not just in info coaching. I have a one at bat with this, which is essentially this company right here. Um, and scaling into this and learning as we go. This is showing what we're actively doing and showing what did not work which is a lot of the other videos and what is working for us right now. We're scaling pretty heavily right now and uh this is working and we fixed marketing system as our first big bottleneck because we weren't filling calendars for our team. Once we fixed marketing we realized that sales wasn't closing the right amount of them. So we solved for sales team with a new uh manager. So coming from the people portion we hired correctly and we now have a manager in place. So that has only changed a couple things and has had massive impact in terms of daily cash collected. Fulfillment system is getting a complete overhaul. We actually have other offers which comes back to fulfillment and sales and we are building that out to be the big issue there right now is kind of the tech and infrastructure because the the data they have the ability to fulfill the efficiency and the speed that they can do the coaching so they can have more clients per coach all of that kind of stuff is really coming down to like the data and the framing around how they do it. So, we're rebuilding this system next in and it's not even broken is the beauty of this. We're doing it proactively because we know this one's firing. We know this is firing and it's only a matter of time until these ones break. And to be honest, this one's kind of always breaking, right? So, you're always managing people. There's always something. There are personal problems. There are things that happen. That is life as you know for yourself and as you know for your teams. So, this one is an everchanging thing and it's really really helpful to have strong people over here. Whether that's you and your, you know, leadership or you have a strong leader in place like we do now at this point that manages this whole thing for us. But we're just trying to scale now to the level where we have strong CMO, strong CISO, a strong CPO. So this is actually product, a strong CTO, and then another strong people person. So CPO, right? That is the level we're trying to get to. And this next and I'm sure there'll be 15 more iterations of this. But again, one of these is broken in your business. And I hope this helped you solve it. Find your bottleneck. It's my thing I'm going with. But if you go through here, www.rankclog.comdoc. I think I believe today is day 71 or 72 in a row. I've made a video every single day. I've been mixing it up and doing stuff with really cool people I have met through doing this. So, I've been doing some cool interviews uh with different people who are crushing it in the space. Guys are doing 5 million a month. Guys who are are on their way to doing 5 million a month. Guys who have done over 60 million in MR offers uh that are scaling them up through organic. Like just crazy stuff. Um so yeah. So check those out. Hit me up on IG or X if you guys have any questions or if you want me to talk about something specific. And then tomorrow I do a oops I do a video where I go through all your guys' questions which you can find here. It's just a simple form just says pick a video topic or what you want me to break into and I'll walk through all of them tomorrow and which is May 24th. Okay? And if you're just coming to this on another day, you can still submit here. I do those weekly. So talk to you guys soon. I hope this was valuable.

# the man behind $62M in MRR offers... (Ahmed Saddique)  | EP69
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPqltjDxBtw

way. Appreciate it. You too, man. All right, let's kick it off. All right, guys. In today's video, we have Ahmed. I have heard him on X. I have been highly highly recommended to him to talk and do one of these fun videos. We have no structure. We have no plan. And we are actually This is the first one where I haven't talked to him prior to this. So, it's going to be a full get to know. Yeah. First time. Full get to know. So, let's kick it off. So, yeah. I mean, I deep researched you. I'm going to be honest. I I took your ex, I took your YouTube, I fed everything in. I bulk watched a bunch of videos, so I have some context, but for those who don't, who are you? Who's the what's what's the quick slong elevator pitch? Yeah, I got you. And u Yeah, no, it's a pleasure to be here and uh do this with you, Ryan. So, thank you for having me. Um but yeah, I uh basically to keep it really simple started in like marketing in 2017. So before I would like to say like info was glamorized as info like back in the good old days when there was like barely any competition and stuff. Um so I started off as like a CMO at a company as one of my buddies. So like I really didn't know what I was doing. I was just figuring [ __ ] out along the way. Um but that's where I started and we grew that company to about eight figures a year um from 2017 all the way to like COVID 2020 to 2021ish. Um and then after that you know you learned a lot through like the trials and tribulations and messing up a lot and consuming a lot of information from different people. Um but at that point you know this kind of like word of mouth kind of took by storm where it was like more people in the industry started finding out about what we did. Um and again at that time at least from the space I come from is just very organic based. So that's something we could talk about today too is like uh we're very organic centric. So a lot of these big organic brands were like reaching out and they're like hey could you help me out with this? So then we worked with one other person and we scale them then another then another uh and then you know we partnered with some of the biggest kind of mainly trading brands. So we started in the trading space and since then like we've only been in the trading niche like that's the one thing that we've specialized in. Um, and so, you know, I've learned a lot through that and and making a lot of mistakes, too. But, yeah, essentially that led us to where we are now. So, we've probably done close to like I think we're we're probably this year going to cross like definitely like 100 million across all of our partners combined uh and like revenue we've done. And we've done everything from like launch models and different DM strategies because what worked in 2017 didn't work in 2020 and then what worked in 2021 to 2023 2024 doesn't work either, right? So, uh it forced us to adapt a lot. So, I kind of personally have been through like three different market cycles now in this info space. Uh and then today it's like figuring out like what's working today and then also the future of this. So yeah, that pretty much led me here. Um, then I met Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. And now I'm making videos every day. No, that's crazy. So I I mean generally how these will run is just like trench talk. It's like what is actually working now? What is the crazy tweak? What's the Because the true target of this is, you know, multi6figure, seven figure a month people and just networking cool [ __ ] You know, people to hang out with when you're in a city and just chop it up and do stuff like this. And like that's what these conversations started as. We just started filming them. So yeah, I mean, so you can choose to dox or not. I usually don't say like a ton of names. We say stuff that like we, you know, message about, but if you don't want to say company names or brands, that's up to you. But so for 2017, so that was what kind of trading the first one. Um I I won't I won't say the name and the brand. Yeah, I was going to say it's up to you. But yeah, but some people might know the name if they're watching this and they know me. Like some people could put it together. So if you can, great. Um but um it it was just a trading offer. um it was a big brand um like a personal brand and at at that time even p personal brands were not like a thing right I think now they're just more like mainstream like you kind of need it in almost anything right u but at that time it wasn't like a huge thing so what was working then was honestly like I kid you not like I I have screenshots of this like I could probably send it to your like we pop it up here but we literally had I would have to know how to do that yeah but we literally had like a five and a 10k K offer on like a notes app screenshot and like this is how like you know like the decentralized the market was at like you know it wasn't saturated there was no competition um and this brand just had a really cultlike audience and it took off because like he the the founder ended up doing a YouTube video with some person and it just blew the [ __ ] up like there wasn't any real secret through to it and like we were just like again I'm all new to this so I'm figuring it out but we legit at that time had like the whole offer just pasted on a note tab and we just DMing it to people. Wow. And it was like an inerson slash like hybrid online type of thing. Yeah. I was going to say let's get into that. I mean like let's go. So you said five and 10k offer. So like literally what what like you're accepting payments on a Stripe link. You had a sales team. You're doing DM. So So no sales team. Um it was all through DMs. So that was like our main acquisition channel. We had like a company page and then like the personal brand page and people would just literally DM us from that interview which kind of really took off. And um from there we just you know the founder went heavier on YouTube build a lot more credibility in the market and just we just doubled down. Yeah. And for like 3 years we just went on a tear. So we ended off um you know all the way to the end of like co like 20 end of 2020 and then the founder ended up just dumping the info and leaning into SAS. So he's in a SAS company now uh which is why he left that. Um, but he's still around and a lot of the guys, again, if you're in the trading space, you probably like will know who I'm talking about, but I'm not in the trading space and I think I know who you're talking about. So, yeah. Exactly. So, legend. Yeah. He's a legend. Exactly. And so, like and and to be fair, like we can go deeper on the organic stuff, but Yeah. Something cool about him is the fact that um organic brands I've noticed usually don't have that much of a lifespan. Like a lot of personal brands, they really burn out their audience and they don't know how to stay relevant for a long enough time. cool thing about him was the fact that like his shift into SAS I think helped kind of like keep him more relevant because the superpower became like I'm not going to sell you anything, right? Kind of like Alex Forzosi which is I think what made him stand out from everyone else, right? Um and so there's a lot of that element that helped but then from there it was just like I was like well what do I do from here? But we had people reaching out like, "Hey, could you do the same thing you did for me?" And then that's when the info stuff started for me really uh getting into the weeds of stuff. But like legit, I was doing like weird sales calls like over the phone during like the 2017 and 2030 era. Like I didn't know what sales calls were. I didn't know what email campaigns were. Like I was literally like just a young kid. Um I knew this guy and he was just like, "Hey, here's all the hats to the company and just like let's build this thing and like just do it." So looking back there's what I know now if I if I wish I knew then like we could have done crazy high tens high tens real quick. Yeah. Yeah. like really and and I mean to be fair even if he was to launch something again today which is something we joke about but it wouldn't make sense for him but um he just tear I mean yeah I assume we're talking about the same yeah or I'm thinking of the same person or whatever but yeah that the evolution of personal brand in a way like you said where you where you're not selling something but also where I mean Iman talks about this hormone lives this right these guys like you're on the journey of the growth through the personal brand, right? It's like Eman saying it's like, oh, it was like SMMA or it was like, you know, a human, a young kid trying to do something, then it was like SMMA, then it was online business overall, then it was personal development, then it was like, you know, public fa figure fame, but like still tapping into these and when you can go on that journey and even if you do sell stuff like even, you know, Elon kind of sells stuff, right? You sell through proxy, you don't sell direct, right? And it's like, yeah, super powerful. So, so you're you're DMing 5 and 10K offers. People are literally paying on like a Stripe link and then you're what was this like stack then? You're getting them in a Discord. You're getting them in like a Yeah, just it was Kajjabi at the time. We still We still rock Kajjabi. So, yeah, Kajjabi is good. It's good backbone. Kajjabi. It was Discord and then there was like an in-person thing at the time like we were going on like a a world tour uh doing like classes in like New York um you know different just cities across the map. So like we maximized even like the in-person stuff. So like that objection was like oh you can't make it there like don't worry we're going to make sure that you come you you can near you. So that that really did well. At one point that was flocking from like anywhere from like 500 to a million a month just through like DM links. Like it was crazy. And so the structure of team at that point is a handful of like CS style like and you know a couple operators. Yeah. And the brand. Yeah. It was like me and like a few other people and like just some VAS and like just like you know that's pretty much it. Like there was no structure to it. Like there was like as complex as it is today like I would love to go back to those good old days. Um but but today you have to like pull arm and a leg and have a structure and have a eight player team and a eight player tech stack and like it's it's so much more complex now. But those days like it's like I tell people and they're just like like dude like that's just crazy. And I'm like like I know like I I wish we could go back and this was all organic like there was no paid being done. Um but I think that was just the power at the time. I think a lot of it especially in the in the info e-learning personal brand space like um if you have an organic brand you got to really know how to lean into your strengths and like your weaknesses. And at the time like the strength was the brand right? Like we weren't doing anything special marketing wise to sell. It was just that the face and his credibility sold, right? And and so like when there's like, hey, what's what was the secret truthfully there wasn't. It was just it was a really unstructured way of like doing stuff like trying out a webinar like [ __ ] it. Okay. Like yeah, whatever method gets just Yeah. just more inflow. That's crazy because if you think about like you just said like the good old day or those times I mean if you're rocking organic you know some VAS and whatever that thing's a 60 to 80% you know margin. It was high margins like Yeah, that's crazy, you know? I mean, no sales teams. No Exactly. No, no DM setters existed. Like that wasn't a thing. Like we were just like doing it. The same people that were selling were the same people. Yeah. Doing the customer support stuff. And like I was, you know, just doing all of it, you know? Yeah. Dude, there's so much value in like ignorance. Yeah. Yeah, so much value where it's like, you know, there it's not built in that, oh, what do you mean? A DM setter makes one to three points and a closer needs to make 10 and they're separate people and then the manager makes override and then CS gets their thing and they can hand only handle up to 30 before they go to the next trunch and it's like all that stuff that like is everywhere now and is expected. And then we've never done a good job and like I don't know how I mean by the sounds of it and the VA and stuff like that then but our stuff has always been like you know North America US like style employment too. So then you've got that and you have the in a nice way like type of person and expectation and like work ethic and stuff in tied to a generally speaking higher wage and it just wasn't like that back then. Yeah%. Yeah, we're W2 everything. You know, I joke I'm like, "Oh, we have an HR director like crazy." Like she's great. But like it's, you know, 130 people. It's no Yeah, it's no joke. So yeah, no margins like 80%, let me tell you. Yeah. To it, you know. Yeah. GPT yanked on here and said 62 million. It came it pulled from somewhere. Yeah. Which is cra that's that's high. Like that's Yeah. There's only a handful of people that I've talked to that do size. Like that's cool. So you did that one as your first one. Then it went into like what you'd consider agencyish. Yeah, we took on one partner and then like what we do now is like we work with just like a hand like we basically still do like the done for use kind of stuff, but um just partner focused like we try to just find brands that you know we know that will have the legs to a be relevant in a couple years from now and you know have the credibility and there just like a lot more checklists that we have now. um a through learning through bad partnerships and b through uh just experiencing different type of audiences within the same niche because we could we could dive into that. No, no, I'm Yeah, because I'm I'm curious a lot of things on that. It's like one, what is the scope? Where do you stop on what you do for service work? So like are you guys growth operator? Are you marketing operator? Are you you know where what's the line on that? Yeah. So we are are are very customized. Like we do everything from we come in and I personally like to just have skin in the game in terms of like I like to be part of product. I like to be part of marketing. I like to be part of sales. That's just how I do things and how I've always done it coming from that because I wore all the hats, right? And you learn that like, you know, product influences marketing and marketing influences this. And it's like, you know, I I just don't feel comfortable personally ever going into a business and being like, hey, you're limited to only playing in this sandbox because that's just not how we're going to get the full potential of this, right? So, I am we come in willingly being like, hey, we will do we will help you structure and better offer pricing, making it unique, standing out in a in a very saturated um space. We'll do the marketing. So naturally I'm a marketer first, sales person second. So like I'm I'm more like into the marketing weeds of it. Like I I've gotten into the sales world now because of like the industry evolved, but naturally I'm more of a fan of like doing so well in marketing to make the sales process very easy. Yeah. That's just my my way of going about it. Layups, right? Yeah. So, so you know, we we essentially do the full N yard, but we only do that for those that we see huge potential in to to stick around for years to come and like not just get, you know, knocked off the chessboard because of like one wrong move or one marketing move or like the the ones that don't have a big enough backbone, right? So, um, those partnerships, you know, and then sometimes it takes like, you know, six months to a year for us to even just build like I I take my time with like building a relationship and like who we want to partner with. And then we'll just do some like consulting work here and there and and most of the time like I'm just jumping on calls for for free to be honest. Then just like helping people out and be like, "Hey, like we probably can't help you, but like if you do these two three things like probably just boost your like, you know, ARR by like this much, you know?" Yeah. You can get to a couple hundred grand. Yeah. Yeah. So, so like um you know that that's the kind of structure we are at right now. But yeah, it's it's it's hard to to scale that because then quality diminishes for us, right? So we can only work with so many people uh which is why we're so careful about it. But you know that to me is more fun like I' I'd rather try to build towards the big big kind of leagues and like Yeah. So yeah, that's like your service scope. What is if you don't mind this part, what is your like monetization tie scope like? Because you know a lot of these guys will do there's a lot right there's there's spread between like a lot of the paid guys will do like you know off a paid number or they'll do new minus paid and a percent of that they'll do profit share they'll do rev share they'll do like you know there's a million of them what do you got if you're touching everything you're getting pi of everything. Yeah pretty much. Yeah. Um, so, so we, you know, essentially we do come in like essentially just real partners. Like we kind of like come in and we're like, "Hey, we have a full stack team of people that I trust and know the operations and we'll come in and we'll deploy this force." It it really depends um on like the business and like who it is because like if they require more of a team size and like we have to go like recruit on your behalf now and it's not like we're recruiting to keep this person in our company like we will recruit but that's someone we're hiring for you whether it's marketing or whether it's this where so like everyone has their own way of doing stuff. Some people are like, "Hey, I'd rather like, you know, do this, but you help me hire to build an in-person team for this department, right?" And so, like, it's very flexible depending on like what their needs are. But the biggest thing that we just ask for is like, "Hey, like can we have control, right? Can we have the freedom to like play around with product, marketing, and sales?" If that's not cool, that's totally fine, too. But that's just like I'm not jumping into into bed with this, like you know. Yeah. Um, so like it is like more of like, hey, we're taking revshare. Sometimes we'll take like depending on if there's a lot of upfront work required, you know, before we even start that relationship. Maybe there's like some like we've done retainers and stuff like that. But again, very, you know, customized to those um kind of wheels, I guess, if you want to. Yeah. So, generally it's a it's a rev share deal though, generally. Yeah, pretty much. That's so clean. That's so much cleaner. I have like Yeah. I just I talked to Josh Gavin yesterday and his is, you know, offer publisher. They take they pick an expert. He owns everything. Yeah. He owns the IP, which is so interesting to me because like there's a there's so many ways to structure it. And you know, ours I I I said in this one, but I didn't have the wherewithal to understand how to do that. Like I understood the business model. I understood the info. Like I understood it on paper or like from watching courses, but I never built one. And then the you know, I came into that company and those the co-founders had done that, right? But his stack was, you know, majority minority stack on total company. Built the whole thing and they were direct partners in it. But it's cool when you can do it how you are. I so you know depth question. Can one of those be the like what's the theory behind do they compete? Are they you know you said you're having like unique propositions across them so like they stand out in the marketplace but like you know is and I don't know the trading space super well. Like obviously there's different like lanes within there but like a lot of you know I'm sure there's some overlap sometimes. How does that work? or is there a reason you wouldn't just be like this is the one and you're going to like crew them all up and do an eman thing where it's like one of them and they have different styles and you own the whole thing. Yeah. So I think you know over the time like I've like I said gotten more particular with the partnerships. Um, and part of that's because my goal is to just find those black swans that can get to like the nine figure level at a at a point. Um, to do that though, you got to like work on the car a bit, right? Like usually you can't just go to the dealer for like to say use this as an analogy and just pick a car because there's so many times even within the trading space like brand names I could probably maybe share offscreen uh but like no doxing you know and and you wouldn't even imagine that this brand's capable of pulling this but you only learned when you looked under the hood and you're like holy [ __ ] this person doesn't even know what they're sitting on right and it's like the demo that they got tapped into YouTube is just like a whole other freaking dark hole um of of things in terms of like the audience you can reach and the demo you can reach within trading, right? And and here's the thing. I'll take a step back too like within trading specifically. It's such a big tan if you look at it in terms of the market because let's compare like SMMA for example or like ecom or like any other sort of like offer. There's like a friction point of entry for like the average consumer, right? because it's like you got to set up like the LLC, you got to set set up the Shopify store, like whatever, whatever. Like there's a lot more of like a barrier of entry. And I guess one could make the argument that you could charge more because of that, right? Uh but then with trading, it's like you could just like people just take their phone and it's like they open up Robin Hood or some [ __ ] and they start trading, right? So the barrier of entry is so like little which makes the TAM like inter it's international. It's global, right? Um and then there's different markets within like there's a German market and then there's the Indian market and then there's like the US market predominantly and then there's umbrellas within trading right and so we've touched all different umbrellas so we know that that vertical of trading has like a very low buying power because of like what the trading kind of like intricacies demand right and then there's like the other ones that they're probably a smaller pool compared to that one but they are required to have more liquid capital to trade compared to these guys. And so you the buying power for these guys is insane. Interesting. So it it's so many that's why like for us it just never made sense to branch out of it. Yeah. Because it's it's such a big market within its own. So you know like we've just stuck with it, you know, and so it's pretty cool. But yeah, I always I try and like this doing all these different things at once right now is like it's literally like ruining my life. It's crazy. Like I I get so spread across cuz I want to do everything like to a tea. I'm like who has access like this and this and perfectly and like the calendar structure and I get I'm like so in the weeds with like that's how I operate is like very so doing all this at once. So when I think about this and like having multiple clients and whatever to me that's like oh my gosh if I had to log into six different Slacks like that would be the end of me versus like having one and that's where we're moving to is instead of having multiple we're going to have multiple faces, multiple angles, multiple you know you could call them niches. It's really messaging. It's still the same like actual niche because our TAM is so large but same with you but like having the different angles and having different like one is and I don't know a lot about trading but like quick ones is like equity you know options versus like crypto let's just say right like having those two and having different brand faces that all funnel though to one core thing exactly is very an interesting idea. So for you guys, what's the what's like your I mean I was I was gonna say your LTV to CAC, but like you probably have little to no CAC because you're anic, but what's the what's like the longtail this on average? It's it's generally speaking the monetization method of the actual business is a recurring subscription generally. Right. Right. Y and then you did something that was a big a higher ticket that was like a term based. Yeah. So um so you're talking about like product structures, right? Yeah. So like when you for the actual units for like when you're selling to a direct to consumer through one of these brands they're buying either you know you set a five or 10k thing that's a sixmon package and then you have a other people who do these you know WP groups with 10,000 people in them that's monthly. Yeah. So, so that's something really interesting about again adding on to trading, right? Um, so the powerhouse that's working right now is like low ticket subscriptions for trading and I I haven't seen outside of the space as much. Like I've heard numbers and like I watch like stuff videos, but um the reason why trading works so well is like most traders don't really want you to teach them how to catch a fish, right? Like this is the archetype of breaking down the thing, but they'd rather just follow along. And so this is where like signal channel yeah FTC wise like I'm going to like you know you got to there's a fine line right I don't sell any of this by the way or have any idea what he's talking about but but yeah I mean so there's a level of like you know people will just want to follow like there's more demand for that than there is for like the high ticket like kind of like hey we're going to teach you how to do this right that's just the archetype of a trader. Um, however, like you'd be surprised. Like I know I actually spoke to like a guy like we're in talks, but um he has a YouTube channel with like 140k subs and you wouldn't even imagine the MR this guy's pulling based on his channel, but he's doing a it's costs like a big I think 100 bucks a month for this monthly subscription and he has 6,000 members. And if you look at the graph, so if you do the math on that, it's about 600k in MR just from low ticket. And the graph's just like a blue chip stock, right? Like there's no churn, there's no like heavy spikes. And that's going to be heavily dependent on how well you are as a brand. And like I was gonna say I have so many questions, but everyone yells at me for interrupting. So I'm going to show you. But like it's like that that's really heavily dependent on h how well of a trader you are to a degree and how well of a brand you are because no one's going to stay if you don't make them money, right? It's just the the nature of it. Um, but that's like what we've seen and like the method that I've always liked selling high ticket is like very like underground and like very different than everyone else in the industry because I feel like if everyone's doing this one thing, especially for organic, we have to be more pretentious because it's like it's not just pay to VSSL to call. Like it's like we have to protect the brand reputation from just burning out and just doing call to actions on your Instagram story. like that stuff probably works and I know the Instagram shoutouts and all of that but it's like I like to do like more underground selling which is what we're doing right now and it's like I'll again I can show you probably off screen but like show rates we're getting are like anywhere from 80 to 90%. U insane stuff. Uh but a lot of it flow to get them there. What was that? Sorry. What's the journey or the flow to get them there? You said like underground's like how it's more like back like pretty much back in ascension pretty much from the load. Right. So, like to put it simply, like the way I've positioned for most of these guys is like we only give those people the option to book a call if they're in the buyer's pocket essentially. Like they got to deserve to get the link to book a call and jump on a team with us, right? Um, and a lot of that like if you're in the low ticket, you're kind of in our ecosystem, so we welcome you, right? So there's a level of like you have a little bit more of a backd and and everyone else is handing it out more of like a commodity thing where you could just like pick it off a bookshelf and purchase it and when you do that the demand goes down for it, right? So we control demand like we control it. I like to have that kind of structure and it makes it more potent for the other person to be like, I'd rather join this because it's a whole different customer journey than what they're usually used to. Like every time we do a sales call, like we're reviewing sales calls, it's like they the average trader has already taken multiple programs and has a traumatic experience and the last thing they want to do is go through the same flow of the same conversation that's kind of being out there, right? So when we take this approach everyone and then the sales style is also very different right it can't the same stuff that's working for paid stuff like in terms of sales teams like does not work for us like we've tried it it's crazy um but like I I'll show numbers to people on like dashboards that we have and like they're just like this is like it's it doesn't make sense for like if I was to if you were to apply what we do for paid it just wouldn't work. No. But if you do, but if you understand the context behind it, it's like, "Holy [ __ ] I get I get what you're doing." Oh, yeah. I mean, it's literally you have an organic and then gated and then through buyer and then like Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. So interesting. So when you're Okay, so the classic model is like heavy consumption on something organic, generally a YouTube and Instagram or something or Tik Tok, whatever, like that. They're consuming heavy. They come in on an MR play. They're in for x amount of months. They're warm enough. they have, you know, I mean, I could go so many questions about just like activation and keeping them in there. And obviously simple answer is make the money. Exactly. Um, but keep them happy. Then what is the ticket on the back? And I'm sure it changes, but is it a five? Is it a 20? Is it a 50? So the next step above that, and I'll I'll this is going to be fun, but so the next step above that, it depends on the offer, but there's a few anywhere right now that we have that are ranging from 5 to 10. And it just comes back to personalization. The higher upend ones have more one-to-one coaching attached to it. The ultimate difference to keep it really simple. The ones that are on their lower end don't have like a a onetoone element to it, but it's more like group styled for for it. Right. So that's like the the barrier we have there. And then uh for one of the partners we have right now, we're actually working on like a 20 30k offer on the top of that. But that's going to be um again I probably gonna have to show you off screen with this but uh it's in more of an in-person hybrid structure um which I feel like is where the pendulum is kind of swinging. agree because like there's like I see offers and it's like especially within trading it's like Discord curriculum Kajjabi whatever and webinars like those are like denominators that prospects expect you to already have right like they're not paying you 5K for that. Yeah. Uh they're they want they're coming on that call for like what else, right? And so like ultimately like the two things that it comes down to is like either people are going to pay you more money for access or customization, right? And so how do we bridge more access? So we're doing inerson in a way where it's still scalable but and I could probably go into that a little bit more too. It's scalable um and it's not like a one-off like an event type of thing where it's like one and done but we can constantly acquire customers for it. Uh that's a challenge within person that I've felt. But this is so interesting. This is like flipped on its head from how most info coaching and stuff is because right it's like for you you're doing you're doing like the done for you as the cheapest lowest like whatever like you know the the list the whatever highest margin. Yeah. But also like the low MR and people are paying then for done with you or do it yourself. They're like to learn the education port. That's which is and most of these is flipped, right? Because usually it's like, you know, you get the book for $9 and it has everything you need to learn it, but then you right here do a group coaching thing for 5K and then over here you work with the one guy one-on-one. It's 50K and it's the same information that's here. It's just how it's implemented. Yours is on flipped on its head. Yeah. It's crazy. Which is so Okay. So that's just I literally have 150 questions. So that's that's just the info and coaching. Yeah. monetization path or portion. Yeah. So like there is there not there's trading partnership play like the there's software plays there's like as referrals and stuff like what else did these guys monetize on? So if we take it a step I don't know if what the like know like because for example like I know these guys in the crypto thing they like point whatever and someone shared a screenshot they made 250 soul just by like organically sharing you know the referral link to a platform for example is like you guys do plays like that is there stuff like that or like the the funded trader I see stuff I don't I don't know how this works so that's where it gets a little bit more out of my scope at that point because I a wouldn't want to get involved in that because then the SEC and [ __ ] might get well that's not allowed referrals No, you could the referral stuff. Yeah, but I guess like a different monetizational route like you mentioned like partnering with them like taking funding from people to like Yeah. I don't know because I know that like for so for example I know of you know there's the three main like I was funny having fun to generate meme trader thing when I had just like a ton of time and I was living in Puerto Rico. I would do 5 hours a day for like a month and all these guys have these links to like these different crypto platforms and whatever where they get percents as like rewards and then I saw other people doing it and like they do it. Oh, join my you know you said Robin Hood but like some of the more trading specific softwares like they break. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's backend like Oh yeah. So, like partnership wise, like there's so much software, like there's back-end partnerships. Like I know I can't go into specifics of which companies, but like I know brands that we work with that they have like six figure plus monthly retainer deals. Um like retainer like not like a like your affiliate commit like retainer you get paid. Yeah. And then commissions like you know the bigger you and the better you are like you know the better you're going to do on that part. But the there's backend deals on backend deals and that's gray area somehow. Um, not it depends on the company. If we go into like brokers and stuff like that, that's where it's like depending on the domain of trading you're in like options for example is like super like regulated, right? Like like you can't you can't [ __ ] around in that. Uh, but if you go into forex and [ __ ] like Yeah. Yeah. Like I I'd probably I'd probably like tuck that away, right? Interesting. And so so that that's the domain, right? So it's like um right now there's like these prop firms like funding like companies and so that's like you that's like the and that's more so like for futures specifically right and so like futures is like I guess the in between in terms of like I'm going to go by so the traders don't attack me it's like in the in the terms of buying power like options would have the highest buying power forex would have the lowest futures is kind of like in between because you technically don't need capital to trade because you're buying like a challenge or something And if you pass like the challenge, you get funded a certain amount. But there's some sketchy companies, there's some legit ones. Uh like it's it's again like closer the further we get to this. I saw someone Yeah. I saw someone posted it and it was like they won like a gift like a certificate thing from one and I was like I didn't it was like they won like two grand. I'm like I don't know. I don't know anything about that world. Yeah. So it's it's like some of those companies are legit. Like you actually will get paid out and they have a good track record but some of them are just like pretty shady. Like so it's like you'll pass your challenge and your account and you're supposed to earn whatever and they'll just be like well sorry like you did this this wrong and they'll just like gify it out and it's like kind of like a casino. They're playing like a casino [ __ ] game. Yeah. Um but I don't know where the qu what the question was. No. Yeah. So around there. So yeah. So monetization around info and coaching is crazy. Yeah, your cost your cost to acquire customer is you know your marketing budget essentially for your for organic team to just produce content and you know social media manage at some level and then so that's so so and then cost to fulfill you said group coaching I mean a group is a group like an MR group you know so whatever you need there a couple CS you know some people from the community you upgrade up but that's low and then your group coaching style stuff is does is it normal for the expert to do other stuff other than pop in the chat and you drop stuff and do their signaling they do or like Yeah. So, is there I I guess the question is there an in between where there's hard cost that's not time of the person who's the expert? Mainly the fulfillment would be just the coaches like crazy. Yeah. Just like one-on- ones like that's going to just be like I'm probably not I won't go into exact deal structure some of them have but like it's like either they'll like they'll work out a deal with each coach I'll say. Right. And so like um but we just obviously protect ourselves because we know like the hard cost is like for each unit that we sell we have to pay this much in fulfillment cost which is like pretty much all it cost at that point. U besides like the sales team but you know that that's pretty much it. Um, but then if if there's like even in the like there's an element where where there'll be that and then the founder usually like it's it's interesting because some of the more guys that are like actually passionate about trading and make real money with trading uh they like actually enjoy teaching and stuff so they'll like pop in like they want to be part of the fulfillment. Like you see this paradox where it's like some guys are like hey like I don't give a [ __ ] about that. Like I'm just trying to scale to like yeah like 100 million fastest way get me there. And I'm like, usually that's like bunch of red flags, FTC written all over it. Like I don't even I you know, but then there's other brands and I would consider them like more black swans where it's like because they actually enjoy the process to a degree. They are usually like they overthink everything a lot more than the because they're not natural marketers. They're natural traders, right? They do this for a living and they're just like, "Hey, like I I want to spend time with like the community and stuff." So what do you Yeah. You know, you hear the hormosies, whatever. So, I've never done anything in in like MMO and I don't know. I mean, this kind of sits in like an MMO and we always kind of joke it's like, you know, the coach teaching the coach teaching the coach is like not the speed. I'm not a fan at all. And I like kind of publicly say that. I don't diss on anyone. Like, everyone's got their own thing. There's a lot of guys I think that it's super valuable that sell info to other info people that, you know, they they they get around a specific domain. So like one guy's extremely good at webinars, one guy's extremely good at like setting, you know, setters, one guy's extremely good at this, and they all sell to each other. You know, you use this person, they use this person. And like I think there's a space for that because they're doing something unique within it. It's the guys that are selling generally speaking like mass market, B TOC, you know, B uh to C, and they're selling how to make money online basically, and they make all their money by teaching people how to make money. Like that's the one where I'm like, eh, like no. So I'm going to ask because you hear you know Hormosi or these guys talk about it. They're like you know if these traders are making so much XYZ why are they doing info and education? And I understand right you're saying like they want I mean one it's a giant you know it's a major generator of cash but is there a place in a space for them to just like if they're that good is it valuable to gatekeep? Is there a way they can do it at a level where they add another zero or two and they make as much or more? Like I don't know anything about that world. Yeah. So, and this I don't want to speak for the traders specifically, but I'll say like the stuff that Yeah. And this is my question. This is not I'm sorry. Yeah. If this is like a dive against clientele, it's not meant to don't understand. Yeah. So, so for a lot of them, I'll be honest, like especially the ones that make money through trading, like I know for a fact u like they'll do well for them like seven figures plus even close to maybe eight figures a year through trading, right? But then to get to that next level from there, you essentially will need to risk more capital. Yeah. Of your own. Right. And if you know anything about trading, not all trades will go your way. Yeah. Right. So there's a big risk factor. So, I think there's a level of like I know certain guys and that guy we were talking about earlier, I don't know how long you've been tracking him, but if you scroll back like he's done really really well for himself in in a lot of different markets, but the one thing about him is he's had really big wins because he's been able to size up, right? That's about it, you know, like that's the secret to it. So, like most most of these guys like they're just not willing to do that. And that's totally fine. Like it's still preference. Like it's like in marketing I got my preferences. Like trading you got your own. No. No. For sure. And so I guess yeah and and the other part of that is then how far you take it within that because I I challenge this with like anyone I'm talking to and we kind of talked about a little is like you know why don't you have one of these that has you know multiple faces in it and it's like your behemoth or even taking one of these like how do you take one you know you said a hundred you know are there exit plays or the bigger one and I use like life insurance life insurance as an example because I know guys who have done this who run an info product coaching whatever that's basically around like some version of taxation and this or whatever and life insurance is like the vehicle they use but they like keep what it is they sell all the info and the education which is valuable in itself and worth the dollars but then they talk about this thing over here they sell life insurance on the back again I don't know any legality of any of this no one this is not me doing this and then they sell this stuff and then they make huge commissions so their LTV CAC you know was five call it right here on info and coaching but then they have this other monetization model where they can then make 50 and a hundred times and built in. I have another one that I'm talking to right now that just found me through this that does stuff in a sports niche and teaches people how to do XYZ and is very very dialed in. They have crazy results. Almost all of it's organic. And on the back end, there's the angle to do, let's just say, like percents of large deal. Like they get things that can be no joke, double their entire annual revenue on this thing that haven't even launched yet on a couple deals of hundreds of students potent like they have this opportunity to do that. So what's the opportunity in this because like what's the next what's the depth of the layer? Is it a hedge fund? Is it like funding? Is it being the bank? I don't know how that works. Yeah. So I think um and this is for you're you're saying like what's their like goal at the end of it? Well, yeah. Or you right if you're a partner in this at some level. So it's like yours could be you take it and then you have a bunch of the these guys inside your umbrella. You do what you know what Iman basically did with educate call it in online business space of all these different ones. You do it within just trading. So you have someone who does crypto. You have someone who does this. They have this. You have that machine. You make all this crazy margin on info and coaching already. You have your tiers of that. You have your partnerships that you can make money on maybe or however that works legality. I don't know. What is like the moonshot on the tail of that where you're like you pick the best people out of there and you fund them. You pick them out of there and you have a hedge fund. You have like what I don't even know. Yeah. So, I mean it's a two-parter, right? Because I I'll answer it from a client's point of view and I'll answer it from my point of view. Okay. Right. So, from a client's point of view, I guess this always just comes down to really like how far someone wants to play the game. Take it, right? Um, like I I know some aggressive people that are like, "Hey, I'm with you and let's try to get this to 100 mil." Um, and then I have guys that are like, "Hey, I'm good with 1020 and I'll call it at that." And if I do that and I go on a 3, four year run, I'm happy. Yeah. Right. And so I think expectations with like for us too as partners are like super aligned with like how far someone can go. Um obviously if someone's like coming to us and they're delusionally not at any level to get to a certain degree like we'll call them out and be just like hey like you know applaud the ambition but like buddy like you got to like hit certain other milestones and usually just comes down to traffic source right um like a big thing that's working right now and I think the guys in our space at the very least that took YouTube seriously one two three years ago where YouTube wasn't just you now like you can post a video, subscribers don't matter. Yeah. And you could blow up, right? Back then it wasn't that, right? Like you had to earn your way up the YouTube ladder, right? And so the guys that spent time on their channels that understood the YouTube game, that got ahead of the YouTube game and adapted really quickly, that's the engine we've noticed. Insane, right? Like Instagram doesn't move the needle as much. Like I know some guys are like deep in the DM world and they got stuff cooking there and I'm like I usually try to learn from moment stuff but I'm just like I that doesn't really pertain really well with the marketing angles that we're taking, right? Because then we have to sell from the face of the brand and put DM setters in there and that just dilutes a lot of the stuff from what I see. And I'm just like that feels very icky and not it's not my I mean it's that it's that trade-off of consumption, right? It's and and like warmth of where they get which is you know a function of that but it's like when you're saying 80% shows and all that on buyers who are in it like you don't get that from DM setting gold outbound you don't get that you don't exactly so I I'd like to I just like to play a more dense and efficient game right so it's mainly YouTube mainly YouTube is the one the driving source and and the channels that are like the ones that know how to get the views and they they know how to keep evolving the content and stay relevant enough. Um, those are ones that it's kind of like a long-term investment account. Like I consider their YouTube channel like S&P 500, right? Because it's not going to go anywhere as long as they stay consistent, as long as they stay relevant, as long as they keep doing the right moves. Like Iman's a perfect example in terms of like organic because he's done, if you notice and you and you follow his stuff closely, it's like he's done those pivots so well to make sure that his name is still around, right? Uh because there was a phase of like let me make the Iman Gazi style content, right? Like he's coined that to himself and then that wave because everything's waves, right? Like things are working then things don't. And then he goes the other way. Exactly. By the time he's already like telling you something like he's already on the next Yeah. the next ship. He's on paid now because you're all on organic. Yeah. Exactly. So So there's So there's that, right? He's smart. He's smart 100%. And and you know he's he's he's a cool dude. But I think um again a lot of it just comes down to like a person's goals. Like there's some people like for example that I see more potential in than others. Like sometimes they won't see the potential that they even have, right? And I'll be like yo dude like you're like not a pawn on the chessboard. Like you have es and those are usually the guys that I think that have like real authenticity. Like they're real traders. They have they come in with the receipts every single month and they're like yo I do this for a living. Uh, like I don't care if my info numbers dip. Like I'm still doing my thing. And that's the best place to be because then you don't force marketing, right? Oh, exactly. And so, dude, desperation bleeds through anything you ever do. And that's where in any part of your life, 100%. And that's any part. And I've seen it so many times with a lot of brands like because I've seen especially within the trading brands, I've seen brands climb to the moon where like some brands were doing like this is like 2022, 2021. And I remember there was one brand, there's this guy, he was doing a million a month in MR through his like subscription thing. Um, I kid you not, 6 months later, all went away, right? One, two stupid moves. Desperation gets a little crazier. You start making call to actions. And so like it just it just [ __ ] like your whole like you'll you'll never be able to that's a that's like if you ever like seen Jeff Bezos like theory on like the twod door and the one door stuff, it's like you know organic you can't [ __ ] around. Like it's a one door. Like every move you make Oh, then yeah. You can't come back up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like your rep once your reputation is gone, it's gone. And I've seen it. And like guys that were on the pace to do 10 20 million a year blew it all away because of one two stupid dumb moves or they did too many back-end partnership deals and they got a little greedy on that side and they started pushing pushing pushing and they bled everything out and right. So they just screw up everything. So I think as much as like you know I tell a lot of the guys we work with I'm like as much as like cash flow is important and for us to try to hit the million months like every single time and like scale scale scale like at what cost? Right? Because like on the back like if we can keep selling more on the back end and make you not look as salesy on the front end, wouldn't that be the best move for you? Right? Because you could do that because you know you can either try to moonshot it and try to be like hey we're going to go for a 50 to 100 blow your gasket doing it and never sell anything for the rest of your life or sell something maybe it's 10 20 but you could do it for 5 years consistently and you still get there. It took a little bit longer but you didn't blow up your reputation and make yourself look like you know one of those sleazy car salesman and just like 100%. So what do you see with the you know that's the person right like you're saying like that's and that's the whole business for you guys right is a lot of the time that personal brand I assume what how do you navigate that with the with the lifestyle with the lifestyle approach that a lot of these guy I mean again I I only see it from the outside and randomly on Instagram or like you know money Twitter and stuff but like the lifestyle approach and kind of twofold question is one you know I'm hearing you say a lot like you know 10 or 20 or hundred of these things. What is like an What is an average of that? Is that like your p is that what you're like pacing? That's what you guys like kind of consistently sit in the pocket of getting these guys to 10 or 20 like Yeah. So, should I answer the lifestyle question first? Well, I was Yeah. Well, because now I'm curious. I'm like, if they're doing 10 or 20, then the lifestyle that like is there you can I mean that's not that much. If you're doing a few those lifestyles can get a little crazy. If you're doing a few million bucks a year and you're doing the lifestyle like some of these guys like the because then sorry my brain is like then that wraps around to this desperation thing because if it does start to churn if the consistency doesn't have the inflows the desperation starts to feed because you're living this lifestyle you're spending 150 a month or whatever. Yep. And if you're not making Oh, you know million a month you're you're like at you're burning. Yeah. Let me get into that. So that's a that's a very slippery slope in my very I've seen some extreme extreme extreme things on the organic side. And so, um, I think here's the thing, touching on the lifestyle subject, I think if you were playing the game in 2020 to 2023 organically, at least in the trading space, I can't speak for most others, but in the trading space, and I think this would be applicable to most other like niches, Airbnb, ecom, whatever you want to call it, like back then, the car games, like you know, elevating your lifestyle, it worked to a degree. Um, and it worked well. But you know what's crazy right now? Like we have a few lifestyle guys. Um, what the moves the needle is the YouTube and the YouTube about raw style like the lifestyle stuff. Like I just I love it. I love it. We just had a partner. We just had a partner. if he's watching this, you might know about who I'm talking about, but they just bought like a million dollar car and I kid you not, like it did not like push anything, right? Um, and and it's just it's for brand awareness, sure, but it's only going to usually impress the people like me, you, or like other info guys in the space is what I'm noticing is like it doesn't it doesn't appeal to because and and this has just been a common thing I've I've said and we've I've noticed from day one is like if a 100 people are going in this direction, just [ __ ] go this way. Yeah. Right. Like you have a better chance because like getting like a million dollar supercar now is like it's common, right? Especially if you go to Miami, it's like they're handing them out like candy, right? And so I'm not against And by the way, like I love and I have no Yeah, me too. I'm like I say that to to each their own. Like I don't I don't I don't judge like yo listen respect if you guys like listen it's fine. It's not nothing no hate, no shame. I don't care. Uh, but it when it comes to conversions, like I straight up tell people I'm like, "Hey, like it's sure, but like it's if you expect that to and I I I always say like keep that on there. Don't screw up the the main engine, which is YouTube, right? Um, so you got to know how to play it the right way, but like the lifestyle stuff is just all cooked to be honest. Like it's just not like if you're play like if you're playing that game, you got to do you got to be really extreme with it." Yeah. And then that's where it's like you might as well just break even with almost everything you're making to sustain it. So is it even worth it at that point to play the game, right? Um but the raw stuff works. The raw like everyone's leaning towards raw like the pendulum always swings and it's it's swung already. And um the guys that can provide like information and simplify it like Hermosi's like content for example like I think his edge is like he can take a very complex topic and simplify it and for like the average business owner or like person and consumer. So it's like oh wow great. So if you could do that I feel like in any niche like that's where YouTube's going to favor because you're casting a wider net. Yeah. And then I also have guys that are like they have more niche channels and they'll go very deep in information where they'll scare away the beginner people. So they're they're casting a smaller net. However, the buying power these dudes have is [ __ ] [ __ ] Yeah. So that's that was kind of my next question is if you're not going for lifestyle it's not as much volume MR then you go to the mid-t high ticket stuff direct or they still come through MR cuz like in that example go to the extreme you have this like you know 10k channel instead of your 500k channel or whatever and you go crazy deep in info and education whatever it's not as much like are those buyers I mean they obviously are a different persona but are they buying the same thing productwise or do they generally come in for the 5 10k group coaching onetoone versus coming into just the trading chat and just hitting signals. Totally. So, I'll give you an examp I tweeted about this actually, so I'll talk about this. Um, so um one of the guys um he's um really deep like he he knows this stuff really deep like to the point where like you'll watch his videos, you won't understand what he's saying. That's that's deep. I love that. uh and uh in co he's blew up um for example and um you know acquired a ton of customers um I put like SQLs so like salesqualified leads for us so um they bought during Yeah. Yeah. So 17,000 people during that period. I'll tell you probably numbers more on I'll make maybe like private note but um on the unit price of that and stuff but it was it was you know it was crazy. And then up until now that like again because like he's not monetizing focused he just never sold to those people like since and they've been just sitting in like a community for 4 years and they just like he just he just like literally offered them the same service almost everyone else is offering but haven't hasn't charged him a dime. Right. And it got to a point where recently we were just like, dude, like you're just like at this point you're just like giving the other market the revenue that you could accumulate because people would happily pay you, right? Diminishing. Yeah. Yeah. Like so a lot of that like a brand like that. So here's the thing. Someone that's very base level with their trading knowledge like usually it's very hard for them to get deep because then you get really need to be really good at trading, right? That's something that I can't we can't control from a marketing side, right? But to someone that's goes very deep, you can reverse engineer that person to be a little bit more wider, right? But that person will need to figure out how to condense the information like Hermosi to explain the same stuff in a simpler net. But now if you could do both, now you're a black swan, right? Because that's interesting. You see what I mean? So yeah. No, 100%. Most guys in the space are hovering up here, right? Because they they can only go as depth as like how good of a trader or like knowledge they have or expertise in coaching. Yeah, there's very few that can go in this vertical which is very interesting to me. So there's a few that we we know and like we're partnered with, but those are guys that are like again like those those pieces on the chessboard that I don't see just you you can't just knock that off because it's not they're not staying afloat because of the lifestyle. They're not staying afloat because of XYZ. Like they're staying afloat because they could show up every day and they could do what they say they do, right? Just keep it real. Yeah. I'm telling you that's where in my brain I'm just like you need just black swan like trading like you're just your thing where you because especially I mean I don't know these people but like a lot of time that like archetype that style of human is someone who just wants to do that and just wants to stay in that and you do all the things around them which I mean I guess you're already doing but just having just the overarching like pin of all of those that's that's that's sick. So yeah, I was just going to say for us it's like you know finding like the more we go more I go on this journey for myself is just finding those brands and working with less but making essentially like scaling them further and that's the fun of it because why not like for myself I'm naturally like hey let's go to the next level. Um, but yeah, I think info just over the next like a lot of what we spend time on is like over like the future of it because I try to get it ahead of the curve because before the curve happens and I feel like for example like I think offer designing and product is something that's just really undermined and underlooked. It's not, you know, and I also think AI stepping in is going to like diminish a lot of products. And my like that's my hypothesis is like, yeah, you know, like I think to the average consumer right now, like they're using chat GPT as like a a voice assistant or like a text assistant. Like they don't know how to maximize it, right? Like I'm not sure like I I've seen your stuff like you're deep into the AI world. Uh I'm assuming and like at some level, but I see some of these guys and I'm like man am I not even close. Like I'll ask on X and people list these things and I go I'm like it's it's so crazy, right? But it's like it's getting to a point like for example like if I'm learning anything like I have chat GPT by my side and I'm learning with it, right? But the average person doesn't know how to do that yet. Like it's just not like a thing, right? Because most people just have the app and they're just conversating with it. So I think as it gets more and more advanced and the average consumer understands how to leverage it the right way, like why can't someone just be like, "Hey, I'm struggling in X, Y, and Z, for example, in trading, right? Here's my data for the last year. Make me a course that's designed for me. Yeah. Literally. And so, like, if you have nothing like if you have no IP, if you have no sort of like ecosystem, if you have no sort of like, you know, higher tail product where it's like back to those two things like customization and access, like those are going to be the things that people will keep paying for, right? Because like I think Hermoszi posted like he paid like Grant Cardone for like a quarter like for an hour a call. Like it was like a quarter million or something, but like why do that, right? Like it's like it's not I'm pretty sure Grant and he says it too. It's not like Grant gave him any sort of like key piece of information on that call. All he told him was like post 10 times. Yeah, I was going to say literally is like your feed versus my feed is the is the clip that stands out in my head. I know the exact video you're talking about, right? And and so it's like you know it's it's like so so I think like most offers are not building those ecosystems. There's one I won't name drop him but like a person I really respect in the space. you may have known him uh but like I I'll I'll tell you afterwards. Um but he's probably like I I buy a lot of courses because the best I became a better marketer by buying stuff. Yeah. Um like I've been through so many like in-person events and I try to see how they like try to sell you on like stuff and like how to do that. I became like just, you know, obsessed with that. And each time I went through those, like I've learned better and better. And I've seen and compared like the lowest tiers of like how people prop up their stuff and then it comes out to become a flop and then they're just shitty and it's fine, whatever. Like I already have like that sunk cost budget in my mind. But then there's like these other experiences I'll go through. I'm like, "Holy fuck." Like this is a buying experience that I enjoyed going through, right? And so like that to me is more entertaining. Like and that's why like I don't think in in our space specifically like anyone's been able to sell like a 15 to 30k package without getting like refunds uh and and returns on it. But I feel like there people would pay for that like especially in the latter we have like people just want more access to the founder. As long as we can figure out in a scalable format we could do it. I know for sure. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. So you the AI how do you the AI part is like and the machine part and where tech is how is there even a space for this I don't understand trading well enough but like how are you not trading I mean you already are trading against bots and what you know what I mean like how is there still room for human if like you know AI is the smartest thing ever when it comes to like the actual product that you guys sell and like the education and training how is that because that market right it was you know you hear quant you hear this stuff like that steady win, but you guys just still teach and use, you know, foundational methods that can still beat because, you know, it's it's player versus player at some level, right? Mhm. Yeah. I mean, I have no idea how this that's going to be more of like a trading centric focus question specifically, but I mean, I'll give you my take on it. I mean, I think it's heading there for sure, right? I've seen like the quants and like the AI stuff like most of them And this is just me hearing what other people say, like just don't really perform and do the best as as well as they claim. Um, but I know like some guys like especially like the ICP of like the doctors and the lawyers that just have like extra money laying around and they'll just pay for 20, 30, 40k for a bot and they'll be like like legit they're like I don't care if it works or not. Like [ __ ] it if it works. That's fine. I get to see it do it thing. Yeah. Legit they go like it's like it's like there's a there's a world like that's what the cool thing about trading. It's just there's a world of pockets of pockets of people. Yeah. And it just goes deeper and deeper the more you're in it. Um but essentially um I I think it is going to eventually become a thing. But it's like you know for example like the best way I I I look at this is like if you look at like AI and quant and stuff like these like big hedge funds like Bridgewater or like Radalia and all these dudes like they have their own proprietary stuff, right? Yeah. Why the hell would they just give that out to people, right? Think about that, right? Like if it's if it's working. So yeah, that was kind of my question is like that is where you take it. That is the how deep can you go? How far can who is, you know, does the person want to go or is the model even capable of going like Right. So I I I don't think like at least for the partners we have it's like that's been like not really it just also gets really sketchy with like the closer it gets to the sun for the FTC I usually I'm like hey like it's a gray if it feels if it feels gray area Yeah. Maybe there's a reason why it feels scary, right? So, I I like to not entertain those conversations as much. It's fun to, you know, go through and talk about because there's a demand. Like, trust me, because we just talked about this, the archetype of a of a trader specifically, people don't want to learn how to catch a fish. Uh, they just want you to catch a fish for them. And like I've seen like these bot companies and AI and you're probably familiar with maybe a few of like the heavy hitter ones maybe. I'm not too sure how how deep you're into that world, but um you know, they're just like people like just throw themselves to that type of offer because it's kind of like it's like the no-brainer offer like hey, we're going to give you this magical tool that's going to print you money like right like I could just see FTC written all over that and you know what I mean? So like there's just a level of like and and that goes back to the question of like how deep you want to play this game, you know? like I don't know if I want to play that game being being honest with you myself, right? Um but I I think there's always going to be room for like access and customization to like right like because especially with like I can't say for paid but like if you have an organic cult of people like they just want to spend time with you. Exactly. They just Yeah. They're asking to buy something from like what you said that guy that just has a community of four you know for four years. It's like they they're they're wanting him to say something. Exactly. Exactly. So I think that's the power in like having a really great organic brand. And I think that's also why it's such a powerhouse to not dilute your brand and [ __ ] it up in in like 2 3 years because like I don't see many brands like back to your question about this like I don't see many brands in our space like they'll have their run. They'll be new, they're hot, their content's flying, they usually just get comfortable, right? They get lazy. They don't expect they think that everything's always going to be rainbows and sunshines, right? Um we're always going to be doing half a million a million months, right? But that just might be like a six-month run you have and then it's like right. Um but but ultimately it's like I'm I I enjoy longevity. Like that's something I I'm like even for myself I'm just like well how do we stay within? We've been we've been doing this since like 2017 and like each time like we've dealt with so many like moments like I don't know if you saw like Top Gun of like that movie like the the like I've dealt with so many of those where it's like literally things change overnight. You've probably dealt with maybe some similar scenarios where it's like everything [ __ ] breaks. Shit's hitting the [ __ ] wall. Yeah. We got to figure out we got to throw money at advisors, coaches, programs like figure out how to fix this thing without bleeding out as much. And for us, we're again, we're less cost, so we don't have much bleeding, right? But it's like still like how do you pivot this boat and machine? Um, and many people just aren't willing to pivot. Like that's or Yeah. It's still bleeding when you're bleeding from the norm. It's just not, you know, coming out of pocket. It's coming out of what would have been in pocket, which is the same thing at a certain point. Exactly. Especially when there's consistent numbers. So, okay. So, what is your because I think about this all the time. I get especially now. So, I started doing this for literally just to meet cool people, do all this and it's like and it's working and it's hilarious. My goal is three to five. I'm talking to whatever and you know I talked to Iman. I bought Iman's thing talking about you know buying guru course whatever. I buy everything. So I buy that. I'm like cool. Talked to in the beginning he's like yeah if you get three to five on X three to five on YouTube have like this consumption you can make a couple million bucks a year just doing like side deals and then you know run the main thing. And I'm like okay. And now I'm like okay I don't want to accept anything. I'm like not you know it's consulting deals or it's opportunities or it's part of this or part of that and I'm like no and because and this is where I'm curious you know I can learn from you is what does the deployment team look like because the last thing I need is to spread focus which anything I do will do that but in current state it would be like focus plus time it would be like time and clicking keys it would be because that's like my leverage in that is very very low. I've never had an EA I've never had like a skeleton team in that way. I've always done it and then I have team of course inside the like main code. Yeah. that now. But that's just that it's like I don't have a deployable and I quote, right, like team where you can have this person come in and I know it's kind of more agencyish, but like it's also kind of holding co style and I know guys who do this with home services, you know, hormone does this with info with every and SAS and franchise, but what does the stack look like of who you like deploy and like how do you I don't want to say like start that because it's a little different starting it I'm sure, but like you break them off by KPI. guys. You have three to five guys. You have 30 guy like guys and gals. Like what's your structure? So are are you saying like what for you for now as now zooming out to you because we just kind of spent a lot of the time like in the actual Yeah. Yeah. your clients or like how their model works their monetization whatever your so far we've covered with yours is like your monetization is generally speaking and call it revshare simply put. Sure. But how do you So right now you have four new people that come to you. You vet them. You go through your thing. you know, one of them's what you categorize as black swan, two of them, whatever. What is the team stack? What is your structure to deploy into there? Cuz you said you're going to go a toz, but like is that a lot of you? Is that like how do these other ones continue to run? Like I envy that. That's amazing. I have one thing, you know? Yeah. So, I'd say we have a pretty lean team. Um, right. Like we're like we have like bunch of different contractors and some VAS helping with stuff like that. But um really I'd say like I'm the and this is where I'm trying to get better at myself is like um hiring dude stuck in the weeds. Right. Exactly. Because I enjoy what I do. Like like I genuinely rap about like I'll jump on like I said I'll jump on calls for free with people. Like I don't care. It's also like I learn so much by just talking to people about like you're doing that much in that audience. Like what the [ __ ] you doing like what are you doing right? Like you know what I mean like or so or vice versa. So, um, that that's a part of it that I think is cool, but I I do see that like, hey, like there's opportunity cost in like me being stuck in the weeds as well, right? Um, so I think the one key thing that's been super huge for us to do this is um, we have like a head of operations person um, that I basically like built from the ground up and this was like I think we hired him about 3 four years ago and he was just like a web developer at the time and um, overseas too and um, I legit it would be like me doing my like regular like wake up, do your deep work meetings, all of that and then my I guess six to 10 if you want to call it would be like jump on a Zoom call with this dude for like two years straight and like literally like it was it's I don't know if you heard that Mr. beast story of like yeah shadow yeah and and he's like because his main focus is like tech and ops and AI like he loves that stuff and he genuinely enjoys building too like he's been a great great great great like sidekick in terms of like I'm very heavy strategy and all I have to do is like hey we're deploying this you can go hire the team you want don't let me deal with that because I don't want to even think about like how to structure the ops do the thing. Here's the KPIs. Here's where we need to get to. Here's the boundaries that we got to stay within and the lines we can't cross. Let's go deploy. Right? And so the thing is we've done it so many times now that like I I wouldn't want to say there's a SOP because everything's really tailored. It's like a fitted suit that we're putting on. You know what I mean? So like there's like a we got the cloth ready, right? like we have it but then when it comes to the tailoring element like that's where it will require a little bit more functioning from his side and my side from the strategy component but that's been I think bottom line I see this across like a lot of like different I speak to agency owners and stuff like that like they struggle with that a lot like the operations a lot curious is because it's it's not easy especially when you're doing it how you are it has to be it's boutique at some level and it has to it's the it's the people it's who you deploy like how they Exactly. That's a cool structure though. So, so he's he's the backbone of a lot of that and then he has people underneath him like he has a like a whole like house of people that he's just hired to like you know you're doing this project, you're doing this, you're doing this. We meet like a few times throughout the week just pulse checks every every weekend. Like my weekends are pretty much meetings with him and like the other team and just like making sure like projects are in check, timelines are in check, if I change anything in the strategy. So I again I'm I am very strategy focused right now but um even like sales focused like um because like I told you like when we were doing launches like so I guess we we didn't touch on this a little bit but like from we did nothing tactical no but we did no we did a lot of the model and structure which is I think extremely val and I think it's also more valuable to somebody who is at kind of what ideally the target market is because like understanding the different monetization models understanding the different like tr levers you can pull and what you are pulling I think is maybe more valuable but like I want to hear it let's hear the challenges let's hear the launches so so launches were like we went on so maybe you're familiar with like cohort based courses and stuff so that's how I kind of like I started following these few dudes on Twitter I'll name drop them because I never worked with them but they were like a huge inspiration for this uh so I don't know if you these names ring a bell Thiago Forte David Pell Ali Abdal yes Ali Abdal so uh they were running these cohort based courses like around the co time and also you got to understand like co everyone's at home like people were throwing money at info right and especially cohorts were like I wouldn't want to say we pioneered it for trading but we brought it over for trading because no one was really doing it at the time so I was like how do you go from just selling a course to like something more tangible it's like okay let's do a cohort based course so there was no salespeople no DM setters it was just email marketing and it'd be like a 60-day long marketing runway list to application bunch of emails great copywriting building demand, building hype, all of that. Um, and we like there was like there's one like study like case study I guess we have. It's to me probably one of the mo my f most favorites because he was so small but he did so many big numbers. So he had like less than 10,000 subscribers on his email list. His audience on like socials was pretty small as well. Uh but like we've done we did about I think close to 15 cohorts within a span of like two years and that netted about like six 7 million right which isn't like like it's like when we compared like the big numbers it's like but like still though it's so sizable that is so sizable right but it's like but the efficiency of it was just beautiful to me right um that you could be so small but if you have a really cultlike audience and you can really position position yourself well to create the demand and a great product and deliver it. You can go really far with it, right? Um then obviously like we did the cohort run for a lot of trading guys like we did like upwards like it went to almost like 1.5 in a day like on a launch with no sales team, no setters. This was like and what so what's the exact structure of it or like what is the offer and then priceish? It's like um so the high so that one particular the one I just mentioned was like uh offer was like a four-week live course. um you get like a community access right after and then there'll be like events that they'll get like invited to and stuff like that. It was pretty like a simple like offer four weeks live course pretty much. Uh and then the ticket price was I believe 5k for that. Like so we were showing like 5k links in the email and people would be buying like it's crazy. Um and that was the highest that that was the peak and this was what am I doing wrong? This is this was but those are the good old days like forget about them. It's not it doesn't happen anymore. Uh, you so that's like that was 2022. Um, and then 2023 is when I saw those launches going from that to uh-oh, this launch not producing the same conversions as it was. Then we did it again and we pushed it and this time we pushed up the intensity of the launch, doing more webinars before them, challenges before it, but it's like the amount of work it took to get the same number that we were doing before got harder. Yeah. So that to me was like, uhoh. Yeah. signal abort like you know this fighter jet's going down if you don't pick it back up right and so then that's when setter closer models were like really popping off and then so we had to pivot and so the hardest part was actually this is funny so our partners got so conditioned to being spoiled with like high margins and then all of a sudden you know we're like hey you're going to need to pivot and they're just like what do you mean like we're doing great and I'm like yeah for now but like this this plane's going to crash if you freaking and don't like pull the plug. And no one wants to pull a plug on like when you're doing launches and and they were still doing like like 400 half a million close to like you know like they were doing like it was it was solid for like you know the structure it was but it was declining and I'm like that's always a sign of like pick up your bags before it's too late. Yeah. And so some of them pivoted, some of them weren't, you know, they just weren't like they were like just you know hard-headed and they're just like hey like no this is good like I'm not going to go hire a sales team now. Yeah. Right. And so I'm, you know, that's where we just had to kind of draw the line where we're like, hey, like if you're not willing to evolve, and that's where the partnership and selection process comes in is like, you know, to each to their own, no judgment, but again, like I'm I'm not I'm not we're not going down in this plane, right? Like we we'll let you we'll make our case and if that if that's not the way you want to go about it, it's your business, it's your brand, we're not going to force anything, but if you want to stay longer, this is the move to go, right? So some of them we positioned and shifted really well, but that was a shift whole thing, right? So because we literally had to like shift that model, turn the whole thing around and like plug in this new system. Uh and then like you know now even like the setter closer model is getting to a point where it's it it's and people aren't and that's the other thing too. I feel like in our industry like many operators, agency owners and stuff like they don't realize like there's there's always going to be an end to it. uh like waves come and go and I think being part of like multiple different cycles and learning it the hard way because you face it fa and head on and you're just like well [ __ ] like this is going to suck for like six months to a year which was like literally a lot of 2023 and 2024 was like [ __ ] who do we pay to learn this the fastest way like what rooms do we get into like how do we evolve and get up to speed with [ __ ] that's moving and it's like once you build the cushion it's like take the cushion and run with it like add another layer of a cushion and start preparing for 2026, 2027 because this stuff I think is going to change a lot. I think the way people are selling is changing a lot on sales calls. We're not we're noticing it especially for Sorry, this is going deep into like the I love it. Yeah, I'm learning so much. I Yeah, this is great. So, even with like for example like I'll I'll talk about sales team specifics, right? like we're running offers and because they're organic brands, we can't sell and do sales processes that everyone else is doing in the market. Like Cole Gordon, love him and like all the stuff that he preaches like like all these guys like I think there that stuff works. But then when you try to bring that exact stuff over to organic at this scale, it becomes really difficult because audiences feel this repellent like it's like that car. Yeah. Like that hard Yeah. Like hard clothes style. You mean like and so so Exactly. So I have so like when we were recruiting initially like I we poached like some of the top closing talent and they just [ __ ] the bed when it came to selling here and I was losing my mind because I'm like you've done great here like why can't you you know what I mean? And so then I got the further I got into the space and I realized the archetypes of like the ideal sales profile of like even your closer right needs to be aligned with like and I think you guys like warrior babe like I you know I was actually at um sales con and you guys had like the whole table and I as soon as I saw the table I was like yep that's that's that's that's them right. But it's like you you if if like even for like a a regular fitness offer though, like if I'm a scrawny ass dude on a sales call, right, and I'm trying to pitch you to be buff, like it's just kind of work. Yeah. There's like simple ways to look at it like that. And then there's like, you know, stuff that's the archetype thing is it's real. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's real. But the the source of the lead is real. The It's It's deep. It's deep. So, we had to we had to like, you know, dial down those aggressive closers because they were used to hard selling, tie downs, like all that stuff, and it just didn't work. So, then it's like, well, okay, like how do we we like legit, this is funny because um like we launched an offer um a new one, and it was like this hardcore sales guy, and I this guy, this dude crushed like he's been in the game for like almost a decade. I've known him, track record, everything. Like, he's good. Uh, and I bring him over and like that day we get like five like negative Trust Pilot reviews. Uh, because like how hard he was selling, right? And, you know, I stayed up all night because he was like in Europe and I was like, "Dude, if you get another Trust Pilot review, like I can't I got to put you I got to I can't I can't vouch for you. Like, I know you're good. I've seen your record on other stuff, but like we can't do this." So, he's like, "What do you want me to do?" And I I kid you not, I was like, "Don't pitch. Whatever you do today, just don't sell at the end of it." Yeah. And he got like, I think five pisss that day. Like it it worked. And he's just like, "What the [ __ ] just happened?" And so, like, at that point, it's like, okay, like you start to realize that especially for us, you see how tailored it becomes because it's not it's to the brand that we have to favor. Even if it's in the same niche of trading, like one brand could be so different than others in terms of like the perception of like how the face comes off of Yeah. Right. So, we need the people to embody the same kind of format of discussion or it's not going to work, right? And so, it's it's crazy. It's so interesting. Yeah. We haven't had like the change of uh that because ours is I mean we're 90 whatever 8% paid. Yeah. Like so we don't have even though we have so much organic ours all sits middle and like acts as moat and trust builder and like gets it over the finish line and you know gets that that consumption side but when it comes to like actual like initial click it is paid like we just hammer it. Yeah. So ours is almost for a long time was the opposite. It was like they're too and this is again no offense at anyone and like doing that but like it was more it was a softer approach that is how we sold. Yeah. And it almost needs to go the other way to be more like that to like reenter it and find its way back. Yeah. But now that we're doing that, you know, same lead flow, same volume, same whatever. And it's double the units 100%. Day over day, day over day, day over day. And now it's like, you know, 10 days into that happening since we shifted that up like literally right now. And it's like [ __ ] like you know back to 100 150 whatever a day just like steady state all high ticket all whatever. So it's like knowing that is such a super. So like you just go to sales con like that's so so what are you doing there? I I you just go to things. Yeah. So yeah, I do go to a lot of things. Yeah. No, I I respect it. I like it. I mean Yeah. Yeah. I no matter how big, small, those guys that ran it, I'm I'm pretty close with them. They're pretty good group of guys. Um and um just like I try not to go in all the rooms. Like I try to be pretentious. So like like my mind's like I feel like learning is a skill in itself, right? And it's like you learn from the wrong people, you could poison that well that you have here. And so like I like I will try to like listen to like those deep podcasts with like only a hundred views and then they'll mention like a name or two and then I'll Google that name and they have zero they have zero views. Yeah. Like those are the real guys, right? And so I mean you know there's there's there's a few people on that stage and stuff that were pretty cool. So I it's it's it was cool because at least for there it was like people there was closers and setters all the way up to like business owners and then you guys were there too. I mean, you weren't there, but like I think your team was there. Yeah. So, it was just like a wide it was like a wide range of like just people, but it it was just good to like just switch. I like to just switch it up like especially when I'm in a rut like go like so like you know you learn you shake a lot of hands, you meet people, it changes your beliefs like it, you know, I share it a lot like also because like I feel like and not to just try to toot our horn or anything but it's like the way we're doing stuff is just very like different and like in its own bubble in a sense, right? And so it's like I I want to figure out like how do we make this better or like how do we like influence and like just learn from other people to just keep this thing like becoming more unique and like you know growing it. So um I'm I'm always like on like I'm figuring it out and I'm just like even right now I'm like like each year I've just learned more and more. So it's like you never really figure it out. You know what I mean? It's just like and you just never know like like you said there's some people that were there that were just so good at DM setting and like that was one area that I'm just like talk to me through that. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Who who can I pay to literally implement and teach me? Yeah. Implement it so we get the skill so we get the result now. But teach me so I don't need you. Yeah. Exactly. So it's like you know that that's that's a part of it but you know it's it's it's given but I'm on like day 70. I don't even know what I'm on on this. Like 68 70 in a row of making these. And that is my biggest not the time is hard like the structuring of that. But what the biggest thing around the like spewing versus learning like output versus input is crushing me and I and people hear it and say it and whatever. They'll be like oh like you're just you know in the last couple you talk too much or you do this and it's like cuz I'm just in that mode of just like here's everything I know and like I try and be like this is really like not ego. I'm not trying to sell anyone anything. I'm not trying to say this is the only way. This is what we've done. This is what worked. This is what hasn't. Here's what we're doing now. Like straight up. Yeah. But it has put me in such a different frame that I like almost need to like pull out of. And that's why I'm happy I'm doing these. And this one with you has been the best example of where I can like go back into absorption. All I did for the last 10 years is listen to things 18 hours a day about other people talking. I've heard every single Horoszi video. I've heard every single Cole Gordon thing. I've heard every single like any of these guys. I've paid everything. Every Eman course. And I just am like and then we implement. We learn our own structure of it and then we go. But I don't ever talk about it. I don't ever share it, anything. And now all I'm doing is like spewing and not taking in anything. And it's like crushing me a little cuz I'm like, what am I missing right now? What am I learning? I know I don't know about AI. I don't know. Half the stuff you're talking about like is so like new to me. And the structure and like the margins is so foreign. So this is great. This is like Yeah. I mean, you can always learn. So likewise. Likewise. All right. So let's hit the Twitter questions. Uh, I have two or three that I see and there might be more, but I don't know how to navigate X very well. So, the Where do you see the future of info in the next three to five? Okay. I think we hinted on it a little bit with like AI kind of stepping in. Yep. But I think um more tailored, more customization, more access, like if you can figure out how to put that into a scalable version, I think that is going to be the denominator. I also think actually one thing that I've noticed do really well and not for many communities because it's been really hard to do is like the communities that sell themselves like meaning like you go into an ecosystem and you go into an environment where the the client success and the acquisition within it is like automated, right? Like because you jump into this fire and everyone's like, "Hey, like have have you seen what they did in this?" And it's like internally and I love that because it's like you know it's kind of like Tesla. It's like every for every like I think you know three cars they sell it's like one of them comes from like referrals or word of mouth right and it's like how do you implement that in e-learning or like our space? It's like you got to have a thriving ecosystem to do that. It's got to be a good community. You got to have good that I don't think there's a lot of emphasis being put on those things because it's like okay tactics. How do you get a high show rate close rate? Like let's and I get that too. Like that's fun stuff. But then again, my like strengths have has have always been how do we play this more efficiently? How do we work smarter not harder? Like we'll work hard too, but like why not beat people at the game of this, right? Like how do we how do we do stuff that like moes within the business? And like that to me, I joined one and I'll share this with you after like in Twitter. We'll probably send you a DM, but like there's one company that did it really really well. Like I went through that buying experience and it was so crazy to me because they got me hooked. Like it was like [ __ ] like I'm in, right? Like give me like here's my credit card. Like I'm like, sell me this thing. But when I got through it myself and I'm just like, wow, it they didn't even pitch me. It was the community within it that kind of got me through. And so I think if you can format that and build that, I think it's not going to be like a return right away. Yeah. Well, that's that's the game, right? But like it it's going to be one of those strategies that are going to keep you like 6 months and 12 months. It'll compound. a lot and the the the rippling effect of that is crazy, right? And so I I think that's part partly one of the things and I think again in person is going to take a big swing. I think like those that can implement it the right way. Um I remember Sam Ovens, you probably know Sam Ovens, right? Like his dude I bet my that's how I joined this company was from the community of one of the paid courses. One of the co-founders posted something clicked into his profile. He was looking to bring on basically the right-hand thing what you were talking about like shadow me style. Yeah. And I came in through that and then now we're here. Yeah. Holy [ __ ] Because that was my start too. Like he was the first program I took into this marketing world. So um crazy but key everyone saw us buy everything. Sam Ovens, right? But um essentially like he was running those quantum masterminds at the time. Like I don't know if you saw that but like those were big ticket freaking things at the time too. And I think like he did a great job of of doing those. Only thing that was missing was I feel like there was no automated structure around it where I was like he needed to be present but there was no like automated way to keep selling it unless there was like an event booked and then you got to fill out the seats and that to me is inefficient. Like why not have more of a revolving like structure? So we kind of I I borrowed it from the experience I went through. Uh, but they have a really great automated way to do in-person events. And that was the selling point for me, right? Because I didn't pay for more. I I didn't need more information technically. Like I I I'll take information, but like I'd be I'll be very specific with like what I want to feed my brain. Um, but it was access. It's like how do I just get in a room of people that just do this like day and night and just sleep, eat, sleep info and like marketing and like all that stuff, right? And that was cool to me. So when I saw that for myself and I saw it within other people and that's where I think it's going. So I think if you can make it AI proof and not be if you if you're if you could be replaced by AI like your e-learning business, I could just go and create a course for myself. Um I think you're in a very fragile point. Yeah, I would agree. Interesting. Okay. Uh so that's where I'm curious now. This is not a question on here, but where do you see your structure in three? Five is extended my mind. Maybe you maybe you think that far. I can't think that far. Three is even kind of crazy, but like where do you see this situation in three if you have, you know, is it more client load? Is it scaling the current ones? Is it you're done because you made 50 and you're calling it? Is it I mean, I mean, people have different ambitions and you know, I never asked aged or location or desire, but like that's real. If you're if you can put away and you know you're living in a zero zone, that's plenty. So So I think for me, um I definitely like to take some of those deep guys that I mentioned, um I take that as a personal challenge to make guys that are lesser known but so well at their craft and turn them into like those are guys that I think can sling very far, but they will need to kind of like reverse engineer a lot of the way they think. And I think, you know, I would like to have only one, two, maybe three at max people that are doing like 50 to 100 under our belt and we're like at that point just partnered. Like we're just that's that's it. Like we work with you, we keep scaling that and we can just let that cash flow. But I think the player play for me at least I I feel like will be SAS most likely. Um just using this as a stepping stone into the tech world. um a buddy of mine, same guy you probably know, like he made that venture and it's it's it's definitely like not like the same world and it's very very challenging. It doesn't look easy. Yeah. Um it it sounds cool. It's like hey, but it's like I also like the reason why I've been so hesitant with that like that's what I feel like is my direction, but I I want a big enough problem to solve, not something that could just be like a a rapper over AI, right? or like some like quick software that's going to get like you know like something legit like and within our space like you you you know it like there's so many problems but like are they worthy of you building an entire solution around right so I that's that's my thing like in terms of three years trajectory it's like continue blowing this up meeting cool people networking like just you know seeing where things take us really but I think in terms of those brands and those partners like we I think hitting that nine figure scale would be cool. Yeah. Um and then yeah, we'll let see where things go. Yeah, that's Yeah. No, that's similar to ours. I mean, we are just gonna lean in hard and ours transitions out of info and coaching at scale, but like even then it doesn't act like it's not even true. It it has additional line items that come in to play once the info and coaching is big enough because the TAM is just so large. But do those are these exitable at all? Like are there is there even like a buyer pool for that? I mean again in info and coaching in general to be clear like I understand that us saying or thinking that we could or might in two to five let's say is a 0.001%. And I understand that but like are there ones that do I I mean personally I haven't gone through an exit myself. Yeah. Yeah. me. So, I I I don't I know it's very hard and especially it's I I don't think if if there is an exit for any of the partners we work with, I don't think it's going to be the entire like the company that someone would buy. I think it'd be more so the data. Interesting. Yeah, because that was the question, right? That's also like back to the depth thing. It's like the person who's the next layer of depth is the one who would be interested even in buying, right? Is because it's like they don't have to do this portion because they already are playing this bigger game of they're a broker. I don't know. again again like our broker they're funded this or whatever and they're buying the access the community exactly like they could they could leverage that like I could see that being a play and a benefit for those type of branded partnership companies right so I again it's just I feel like unless they pay a salary for the for the founder and the face because that's the problem right it's like yeah it's a huge problem that's been info and coaching demise yeah right so it's like that's the thing so it's like I I don't think like many companies obviously build for like I think you guys like I saw I've seen your like building towards like the enterprise value and stuff and like W2 employees and like all that like most companies don't even think about that or touch that right so it's like I think that does come down to like I think first for some of these guys is like hey prove the concept of like you can get to like the eight figure level right once you cross that threshold I think then it makes sense to have a conversation about that before then I think you're just kind of delusional right so yeah no yeah it's it's still delusional by the way we are delusional right now I We were doing we were acting in a way of like like you know hearsay on how to get this to a place where it could sell everything down to like oh your entire sales team used to be W2 when like your sales team didn't need to be W2 then they were not operating in a way that they were like employee like you know the legality of it of like 1099 versus W2 and like you know are they telling them what to do you have these strict hours they have to follow whatever it's like we weren't even doing that and to move them over is the 20% hiking costs and then the base floor so people aren't who aren't hitting like it was such a costly mistake. Yeah. And that is just one simple example of like we eat so much margin because we are preparing for a time that when and if and like versus these other guys you know right I mean think about it you would get rid of if you're trying to team stack up and you don't want founder risk you need founder risk gone on marketing and fulfillment and then the entire actual operations of the company need to be run by not you more or less and everything needs to be clean with it and and and and then you know as a business as a whole it just needs to be like up and to the right more or less simply you if you want the good numbers. 100%. 100%. And that's not common to do any of that. So, and you eat margin on the way. Not at all. Not at all. I I mean, I've heard stories from like our good friends. I think you're you're good friends with WAP and and those guys. Yeah. Hunter like Hunter's like big dog. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hunter's big dog. Um so like they I've heard stories from them about like not many exits but like a few. Maybe there maybe you guys have talked about it or not but like u again I think it was around data like they told they shared a story with me um it was about like yeah that's what the VC just guy just saw the data appealing and he was like [ __ ] it I'll pay for this thing. Yeah he didn't care about the course he didn't care about the space he didn't care about anything else. So I I see it but it's just it's very hard very a completely different game. It's the yeah it's that depth thing. Um all right what else we got in here? What are we at? Oh look at us. An hour and a half. Um, boom. What's the best The longest that you've done this, by the way. Sorry. Yesterday. 2 hours. Damn. Okay. So, usually it's just an hour. I just slot off an hour. I mean, me even saying usually is dumb because this is like a third or fourth one. This is the most inter I'm everyone's going to say here. First of all, anyone who's this far, comment 1.5. We did this yesterday and I'm just curious. Um, but comment 1.5. But this is more interviewy style. So, I'm curious to see what people like more or not because thus far it's been like trench talk random. I'm sitting there, you know, by a fire pit with a coffee and chilling with somebody basically conversation. This is kind of like that, but a little bit more like in a good way, like I'm learning from you. I'm asking a lot in that way. So, I'm interested. This is the peel back the curtain a little bit because, you know, I think that will bode better for the future of this anyway. Is like I just want to be raw with this. There's no fancy anything. But, all right. Questionwise, what's the best funnel strategy? So you said initially it was you've gone through a couple different iterations of when it was you know 2017 then COVID range then now. So like what is the one that basically is running now? It's organic YouTube to MR pretty much that's the one that's cooking the most. And you guys are just sending to the exact stack is you sending to like literally like W pages and they're joined through Mr. there. Yeah through W and usually with traders have this obsession with Discord. I don't know if you're like a big Discord user, but like traders, but yeah, that's traders like if you're a trader and usually here's the other thing. I don't want to go too deep into this can be a whole other thing, but but traders archetype is like they don't just buy from one person. They don't like I've seen overlaps and there's overlaps and like the what I tell like partners and stuff like the pie is big enough for everyone because traders will it they're if you look at their instinctive personality, they're gamblers. Yes. The ones that don't know how to trade like you know it's it's gambling but like it's not gambling because it's called trading, right? But because it's called trading. Yeah. The difference. But if that wasn't it. Yeah. And you don't know what you're doing in the market. You're gambling, right? So if you look at their natural tendency and you look towards that, it's like they keep buying different stuff. So like most like if you look at the archetypes, most of them are either in like multiple different discourse and they like to have them buzzing around and like stuff like that. So, I mean to keep it short though, yeah, YouTube usually put traffic, try to accumulate as much of that as you can. Um, and obviously the content itself is actually really important too. Like we talked about like if you do the lifestyle stuff, cool. It's probably not going to move the needle. Not anymore. That's just a trend trend I'm seeing on YouTube, on Instagram, on any platform. It it's brand awareness pretty much it. Um, and and again, it's more brand awareness from like the other gurus in the space. Yeah. They're trying to cop see like, oh, you got that car, you know, competing with the other guy, trying to do the same thing to win the same rate. Yeah. But the audience just doesn't really care, right? Um, and so that's interesting feedback. Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's like um you know for that it's like if you can have a YouTube channel that's solely based that grows solely based on value and you don't have to do some extracurricular stuff to get the views that means you have something really powerful right so my signal to everyone like I think Ravi Abuala talks about it a lot too is like YouTube YouTube YouTube it is a like you don't need a huge volume but trading is one of those niches that I think you can open up it's such a big TAM so you can make content that reaches is millions of people, right? So, like legit like we have like one organic VSSL that we posted on YouTube and it doesn't come across like a VSSL, but it's like an hour and 50 minutes, something like that. And we have like the pitch to the program, like the high ticket, like that's the only place you're going to find it. It's like right towards the end, right? And so, it's like only if you make it to the end of it, you're going to find it out. And that's hit like almost 300k views. 400k views paid to acquire customer. Yeah, exactly. And then like on on that video alone is like well we'll do like a weight list and like again like when I was telling people traditionally like we do weight list they're like our weight lists don't work anymore. I'm like sure but then you do what we do like we cook with weight lists right? Uh because the segmentation and everything's so [ __ ] dialed in and like we said like we make you earn the way to the VSSL the actual VSSL. So that's that alone produced like I think in like last 90 days probably like close to like 1.5 too, right? Um so and from one video, right? So it's like if we just move the CTA just a little bit more this way. Yeah. And we rinse and repeat and it's working and but I I don't think it's going to be working forever for for right now. Like it's it's a it's a thing that's going heavy right now. I think just cracking the YouTube code in its own self is like every channel is really uniquely different. Yeah. I don't know what it is to it, but it's like the thumbnails, the titles, the hooks, and all that. You're in this YouTube world, so maybe you've kind of that, maybe not. But it's happen to be hosted here instead of Wistia. It has nothing to do with anything different. Exactly. No, no. The my my reach and my acquisition is not even a thing. This is a video hosting platform for me. And if people decide to go there, it's like going to a website. And so so that's that's I guess for us like the one thing that we don't really do is like, hey, like we'll help you get more traffic. I was just going to say that. Is there a point of or a partnership, an opportunity something where you can break off something with one of these guy? There's so many of them now and of course you got to sift through, but like wouldn't that be so valuable to you? Yeah. So we do kind of in a way I can't talk too much about it, but like we do have that um to a degree. Like here's the thing. I'm in the YouTube world myself like like I've seen it and witnessed like what some channels have grown super well that of partners that we've seen and it's like just them doing it and I've learned from them doing it not from like anything we've advise them on. So I've I've gotten a good like my I have a good pallet of like I can see what could work and what doesn't. So I can advise to a degree of like I know this video would crush for you and this video probably wouldn't. Um, but like in terms of like expertise of like making the arrow in the thumbnail like that and like titling it this way and like that's not that's just like at that point I will call it quits if I had to do that because like we're already doing so much. So at the very least we're just like hey be good at content when you come to us, right? So like again that's like a checklisting item for us is like hey do you know how to consistently get views on your own? Right? And if you do that's more of a powerhouse. If not cool. If there's an opportunity big enough, then we'll connect you with the right people. Yeah. You can connect with YouTube strategists, you thumbnail guys, you can do that. Yeah. To get it going. So again, but yeah, YouTube's YouTube's a gold mine right now. um if you dial it in properly and you segment the right audience and and here's the other thing too like the bigger the channels grow the more global you get the more buying power gets reduced too because then you start tapping into especially with trading it's like you go into the I'm I'm brown so I can make fun of my own people in a way too so it's like you go into those markets the buying power kind of like you know decreases a bit um and and there's I've seen guys that also crush it in those markets too right it's it's crazy yeah I know affiliate guys that for the longest time were like the US, Canada style. It's like whatever the big four style for all of their paid and these are you're talk I'm talking like raw affiliate lander like ad to lander to clickbank link like style and they forever were cranking that and they completely pivoted to everything but those markets you know cost per click is this and instead of selling the supplements the whatever they're doing like these clickbanky info products and style and just crank they but it's so much volume of everything units because you're selling a $20 thing, but your cost per click is like, you know, cents versus your $2 like spread. But yeah, if you hit it, you hit it. Same with the Shopify and the ecom guys, especially when they do fulfillment that's from those other countries, too. It's like they do only traffic there and then only fulfillment there. So like you have that even if you don't live there, like 100%. Yeah, it's a volume game. Yeah, volume game with with those markets, right? But it's like um Yeah, you know, it's it's it's fascinating for sure. But I I think um yes, just answering back to the question um funnel's working right now. I think uh YouTube low ticket monthly subscription and and here's the other thing too again on low ticket. So something I recognize like monthly subscriptions like for trading are are very sticky, right? Because you kind of have to keep paying to keep getting like the new information on a day-to-day basis. Whereas in like for example like you're in the fitness space like a low ticket there like in my opinion recurring models are one of the hardest models to do. Yeah. We don't even have one. It wouldn't make sense because why would someone pay over and over again for for something unless it's like really No. Yeah. I mean there there are people that crush it or there are people that do enough volume that the churn isn't as big of an issue, right? And it's like because we're all paid not organic. It's literally the LTV to Cat game and like what is the math? And it's just we never since we went high ticket, we've stayed high ticket. Exactly. And it doesn't make sense, right? But then again with trading, it's like it it just works because of the domain that it's in. Yeah. Right. But then I in in other niches like I've seen just like hey like straight like like a book offer or like you know like those small you know event challenges and like those paid event stuff and like all of that. Um that's like worked as well too. So I think it's just you got to be really particular about the load t. I know we talked about MR a lot about this. I just want to put like a disclaimer to people like in a sense like you could try it like it's fine but it's just you got to like like we've tailored everything to the like we know the archetype of this niche so so well which is why we've been able to like be so deep in it and and maximize it. So I think you just got to lean into your strength. So like that's the main thing I'd say for like when you're designing the low ticket. Um, but yeah, then it's like if if you can build a back-end ascension where it doesn't again because these are organic customers, you can't sell them the same way you're selling to everyone else. If you can build a C because the customer journey for us never ends with the low ticket obviously. Yeah. That's just a that's just you hit the first checkpoint, right? And so like then we're put putting you through like assessment quizzes and more segmentation and it's like okay come through here. We want you to do like an implementation calls and like there's like a lot of like stuff that goes on in the back scenes of that to get you know the the metric that we try to optimize for is like it takes someone um let's just say when they from the moment they join low ticket to when they join high ticket like let's just say it's 150 days like the cycle right and so it's like how do we organically reduce that cycle over time right um and that journey and so the more efficient that journey becomes the cycle becomes less and less and I mean I haven't seen that many cycles go like with under 90 days like it's really hard to do that uh especially paid I think is like I've seen like 150 days to like you know products from like zero to like 30k you probably you're smiling you probably have like your own rocking I'm rocking like four right now right yeah ours is yeah because we're not but we're not doing it in the same way so are you guys are going direct to Okay, first of all, you have organic. Your I your whole model is like I'm like what am I doing? Um but the organic is such a powerhouse and it is something that is that I'm doubling going to double triple quadruple down into the going into MR play. I think there is room for it. It's how do we service it? It's how do we make sure it's valuable enough that it doesn't you know cannibalize backend offers. That's a big thing for us is making sure that the offer stack does not cannibalize itself in some way. But for us, low ticket right now is one thing with no upsells. No, cuz in our industry and space a lot of the time it's upsells, it's crossell, it's however we can do that to get it. So your $100 cost per acquisition is offset completely or profitable. And for us, that's not our target. Ours is instead post purchase they hit uh ascension. So it's they get directly on the phone with a setter. Yeah. Yeah. So the timetable though, that's the difference in the timetable. Yeah. It's like it's the economics and the timetable difference because now I have someone on the phone within 24 to 48 hours here and then again within 48 hours here. So my average like true buy time if you're from this to this is 4 days. Yeah. Yeah. And the ascension rate right now is like single digits but like good. Like I mean again if you're doing a $100 cost per net cost per acquisition, it cost you 150 and your product's 50. So, you know, it's 100 to get them to the next step. 100%. And 5% of them do that. You know, like you're in a couple low thousand CPA on something that's 5 10 like for us that makes sense to do. For sure. And and and and again for us like it just comes back to tolerance for organic brands because if we push too hard too soon. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. You don't need to do it. Exactly. That's the beauty of it. It's like when you're saying like, "Oh, it takes 150." It's like, "Cool. What if it took 300? It wouldn't matter as long as you have like the this economic diet. Yeah. The economics the the allowance for trough which you do because you don't have a high expense. You know the trough is literally time. It's not even cash trough really. And you just build that brand. You just build that brand and you're accepting money the whole way because it's an MR play. So you actually are increasing as you go across as long as they don't fall. The more they invest the more they are. Exactly. So you know it's Yeah. You get you everyone again it's like to each like everyone has to just customize it to it's different for industry it's different for niche different for model exactly and monetization model because if you're doing it that way just on the info coaching other people are doing it off of software like the guys who do the you know get my free Shopify course and it's littered with affiliate stuff it's like they make it off the rip right so like their situation is someone is like you said setting up new stuff getting accounts and whatever y and then ideally where they bolt on then info on the back where they get their high get. So, they just made and it's organic. It's like you guys are hilarious. That's why everyone's got their cars and their pen houses, by the way. It's like renting cash. I mean, it's it's amazing. It's crazy world. So, all right. Anything else in here? I don't think so on these. Well, that was great. That was like extremely valuable to me. I think I mean, it's been it's been it's great talking. I've I've learned a lot even just speaking. Yeah. No, I think talking through and I watched some of your videos. For me, a big thing that I've learned is like me 30 days or 90 or whatever ago, my clarity maybe around especially like the systems or thinking or how you process it or your um just your ability to like understand things has mine has strengthened so much from talking about it and modeling it out and doing I saw you do your boards and going through them. Yeah, I enjoy you think. Yeah, exactly. Absolutely. Yeah. So, I think I don't know I get value from that but I'm not consuming anything which is the issue. So I think these are going to be good for consuming those are going to be good for processing your thoughts but like puts you in the teacher seat which is how you you know have mastered which I don't necessarily know master is the right word but like how you know if you can teach it you understand it fully type of mentality. Yeah, but then you're a teacher and you're no longer a student and like like I need to I need to dance that line of like a couple teacher moments and mostly student moments and back and forth. But I feel the same way the same way. Yeah, it's it's cra because and like I said, you probably take calls for free, maybe just like coffee calls and and like I'm usually like legit anyone that's that been on a call with me can vouch like we just whiteboard. I just scribble. Like I just like I saw you write. How do you write? Use your mouth or your mouse? Yeah. You can't do it on a trackpad. You need a like the the Yeah. Well, that's what I use, but I don't know. I saw you like drawing stuff and like writing and I've never tried that. I type in the boxes or I draw boxes and Yeah. The hack is you got to like increase the sensitivity to this is like the highest degree. Yeah. And then like you just got to get like I'm used to like anyone someone every time someone touches my mouse it's like Yeah. Oh yeah. I have everything on max. I just literally I can't write it with a pencil. I haven't picked up I just I'm got used to it. You got that Becker vibe going. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. This used to be so good. Well cool man. All right. So people know where to find you and all that. I mean X is where I found you. Saw you on you know just your name. Yeah. Yeah pretty much. Yeah. my name. Awesome. All right. Well, we will stay connected and we'll have to loop back on this when you're doing, you know,und and something a year. 100%. I'm always down, man. It's been a pleasure. But yeah, we'll catch you. All right. Take it easy, man. Bye.

# the man behind $10M in low ticket... (Josh Gavin) | EP68
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YmRV9vlIok

I mean, most of these just started just me having a good time. So, what is up? All right. In today's video, we are talking with Josh Gavin. Josh owns Low Ticket Offers and Offerpublisher.com. Both of them. Half the time they don't work when I click on them, but you know, it's a Click Funnels 2.0 life. All right, Josh, kick it off. These are not interviews. These are not the classic anything. This is going to be what's the current biz, what's the goal, what's working now, strategies, tech, just jam. So, give the quick one minute. Who are you? Yeah. Name is Josh Gavin. Currently 23 years old as of a few months ago. Last 12 months, I've helped launch over 500 low ticket offers in every market imaginable except sketchy woo woo and self-development stuff I don't believe in. Uh my first million-dollar offer I ever created was in right before COVID 2020. I was 18 years old for piano forproducers.com. It was a low ticket funnel, no high ticket on the back end. Uh, and since then, I mean, most solos get offers that are currently live on the ad library have my hand in it through consulting, done for you work or or something else. And it's a true honor and I'm still student of the game. I I text Ryan questions and Blake, you guys see him all the time. So, I'm by no means made it. Uh, and I'm still learning and I'm excited to be here. Yeah. Two questions. One, you did a million dollars on a piano offer. Yeah. I mean, me, I published, I helped put together. Okay. Well, okay. So, this is like a lot of the questions I get in the forums on on X and stuff. Like, not to call it out, but like the 0 to 10K style thing is like, how do I find an expert and how do I like build this around them? And like I didn't do that, right? Like Luke did that and then I came on after. I didn't have the wherewithal to realize that was a thing. And then, so that's what your entire thing is. That's what I that's my business model now. I would call it you could call it whatever. I call it a publishing company. So, I'm an offer publisher is the identity I take on. Um, some people confuse that with being a growth operator. What's the difference? The thing is growth operators don't own anything. You can still get fired. Like you can you don't own the you don't own the payment processing. You don't own the banking. You don't know the funnel. So everyone's like, "Are you operating? I own the banking. I file the tax return. I own the funnels. I own the list. And if the face wants to leave, then I go find a new face." And I introduce the list to a new name and I keep running the offer. So all these operators are like at risk. I didn't realize that. Okay. So you do it where it's branded. So like you you'll say, let's use the piano one. You can use the name, but we're call.com just for simple. So you're going to take piano.com. You're going to buy the domain. You're going to own it. What's the process? You then find somebody who does. So this just happened the other day. My next deal that's in the process. I I sit around and I actually don't know these answers by the way. I didn't even Yeah. No, I know you're genuinely curious, which is going to make this better. Um so the other day I was sitting around and I'm a creative person, so I'm always thinking up new offers, looking at the market, and people like, "How do you come up with new offers?" I mean, it's just like any other entrepreneur does. You look for problems in the market and you dream up solutions. Then you go figure out a way to assemble it. So, I'm sitting here and I have this idea for a really good offer and I'm like, "Okay, what would I call it?" And I think of the name and I'm like, "Oh, that's a really good name." So, I go buy the domain for $12 and then I sit on it and I just wait for to come across somebody who's an expert in that field. uh if I'm not desperate for a deal like right now I have deals in my pipeline so I'm not actively searching but if someone comes across that fits that domain then I'm like let's go and so literally that domain literally that do so so or could be so this is funny because we did it I was on the podcast we did at the event in Dallas and I was on X and I replied to someone's lead magnet where they were like comment this if you want this download right just classic engagement baiting I'm like you know what freak it I'm going to do it I ever comments on these things, but I did it this one time. And I get a DM from the dude and he's like, "Dude, I just saw your podcast with Ryan. Uh, you should help me with low ticket." I'm like, "Uh, I'm not doing any client work, but you know, sorry, but then I looked more into his stuff." And I'm like, "Wait, wait, hold up. I just bought this domain literally today and I think you'd be perfect for it. Can we get on a call?" So, we get on a call and I pitch him my idea and I'm like, "Can you make this product?" All I say to the expert is this is what I want to sell. Can you make something that can fulfill on this promise I want to make to people? And they say yes or no. If they say yes, then I work with them and we figure out if it's legit or not and we start building. So I'm literally texting him and say we're building the product out. Um and the idea and he's like, "Yep, I can get it done." And he's someone wants to move fast. Screenshot zoom that and swipe it. Who is it? Who is it? Um but so then I will own everything. Walk me through the exact though. Okay. So that's that's story that's story time about it and that's that's interesting. So that's that's how it starts. But I can walk you through like step by step like newbie. Yeah. Cuz I actually I seriously I don't understand this. So you own the IP, you own the banking, you own the LLC. Okay. So you own the domain, you buy it, you find an expert to then come in and be in it. Yeah. Sometimes the domain comes and it doesn't have to be an exact deal because then you also teach this, right? Yeah. Yeah, we teach it. I mean to be honest, you teach it and then you also do it. I publish someone who teaches it. This is where it gets more meta. So, my mentor who taught me this at 17, Mark Lack, publishes the biggest people in the world. So, we're talking celebrities, Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather, Jake Paul, uh, uh, Alex, what's his name? Not Alex Becker. Those guys have info products. Because of him, they do. Crazy, right? I didn't know they had info products. So, my boy Mark Lack at when I was 17, he took me under his wing. This is like five years ago, and taught me this model. And then for the last years, I've been just doing it. And I was like, "Yo, Mark, can I publish you practice what you preach to teach this?" So now I publish Mark. I'm a coach inside the program, but I in this like I practice what I preach. I own the I own everything. So Mark's a face, but I own everything. So I publish my mentor on publishing. Super meta. It's like coaches selling coach on. But this is like legit. You're one of those one of those guys. That's one of that's me. Um but no, it is so. So anyways, I own it all. my mentor self, my banking, everything. I pay out to him. He's there. So, I can walk you through how we do this step by step. Yeah, we do teach it. Mark teaches it. I'm a coach because I do. Yeah. And this is again, and I didn't say this, but I mean, we'll attempt to not dox or do anything with anyone's like actual numbers, obviously. But like structurally speaking, I get this question all the time. So, how does the what's the deal structure usually look like? Yeah. So, I think the most or you and an expert, if you own everything, if I own everything, we'll do a 5050 profit split. profit. Profit interesting profit because we got ad spend, we've got tech and so depending now every deal is different, but what we start with when I go out to the market, I want somebody who's like, "Yeah, let's do 50/50." Now, with the situation with Mark, I actually own more than he does. Um, I would think that's normal. Yeah, it's different. Now, I I know some other people you do 7030, but if you're like a beginner coming into it, you don't have results like I do, you have to kind of make it seem fair to them. And sometimes you even have to like my first deal, my first deal was I got 30 and they got 70 cuz I was like a nobody. Yeah. So, the deal structures you're saying, hey, profit and people, it's so it's kind of crazy. It's kind of sad cuz I used to not know the difference like what profit was, but it's people sometimes get so confused. It's super easy. I mean, it's just you have the revenue that comes in minus expenses, profit. You split that. All right, guys. Let's just look in chat VT. That's what profit is. But you don't know how many times I have to answer that in the DM. So, that's a split. Now, um again, depending on where you're at in your journey will dictate how much you can demand and own. Now, I've kind of gotten to the level where I can say, "Hey, if you want to work with me, I'm owning everything." And they're like, "Yeah, I want to work with you." Um, and then there's some people where you're newer and you may have to say, "Hey, I'm going to own the tech stack, the list, the marketing assets, the ad accounts, everything. I'll let you handle the payment processing because you don't really know me and trust me yet, but I'm still going to control everything else." So, that's pretty standard. But we have students, dude, that go out and they're signing people with millions of followers and they're owning everything and they're nobody. They didn't have results before. So, it's it's not impossible. Yeah. When people ask me, I'm always like, "Oh, yeah." Like it's it's so when we were starting this Yeah. I was in consulting.com whatever group. I talk about this all the time. That's where I met Luke. And like I didn't have the wherewithal to do that, right? And he didn't teach that directly. It was about you becoming the consultant. It wasn't about like partner partnering doing anything like that. Finding an expert. And a lot of the time, let's be real, a lot of it was like consultant to consultant or like B2B, you know, if they even call it that. It's like B to whatever. It's like B2B sells B to I don't know. It's like a weird thing. Yeah. But I mean in I mean I buy a lot of that stuff because I think that there and there's totally space for that. Like the people in the room at the at that mastermind were like oh yeah we sell you know who's bought from each other in here and it's like someone else dominates podcast someone dominates YouTube ads. Someone do so like there's a place for it for sure. It's like the BTOC guys that teach like how to make money online and they only make money by making money online like that kind of thing where I'm not a super fan but like everyone's got their own thing and I'm not here to hate. So, like, but I bought that and then we bought Cosman's course and then we bought uh I bought Becker's course. So, Becker had like this low-key course at the time that was like a Trojan horse for Hyros because it was like up and running now in like a full software but still not like obviously anywhere it is today. And uh in there he talked about doing that and he was like how he did that was some guy in Shopify make money online and he did that and owned 70% I think and the other guy he just gave all the scripts gave all the stuff he shot he was in the ads and he did it and I was like oh that's an interesting idea and then literally at the same time I like meet you know Luke and doing that so it's it's nothing but that was a 7030 deal is where I was going with that. Sorry, my brain trouble. But like it's so like where the the 70 of the marketer, owner, operator, whatever you call it. Yep. Yeah. And so what's funny is this model or mechanism like we can make it sound shiny and new because no one's heard of it or it sounds new and shiny, but it's been around forever. I mean, I was just watching or reading a story of Weight Watchers and she got published by somebody. Mhm. And so if you guys look at the original story, she started doing stuff in her home. She started these little groups or like community groups. She'd help people lose weight and she's just doing it for free. Then a businessman comes along and he's like, "Why aren't you charging for this?" And she's like, "I don't know. I'm just an expert." I was like doing helping people. And he's like, "All right, well, let's partner together." And they built that up to a massive company. Um, and it was acquired by Hines in like the 70s when their private equity. Yeah. Hines bought it in the 70s. Ketchup. Uh yeah. Yeah, I think so. They were like doing private equity back then. Um and then Oprah bought a 10 percent stake and became the face of the brand that Oprah as well really did that. Yeah. So, but before that I was making millions of dollars and they're huge and so it just shows you like dude this has been around forever and I talked to these OGs in the game and the guys who are quietly making money behind the scenes like they're just low-key operators. This is the path they took too because they don't want to show their face. They don't want to be out in public. They like to just operate behind the scenes. And so, um, we're just now just introducing this model more publicly, but you know, it's not I'm not sitting here like, "Yeah, I'm first." Like, no, no, for sure. But this just goes to show that it works. Like, for realistic, should I do this? Will this last? It's like, yeah, it's just uh it's almost like Jay Abraham talks about finding ways to do strategic partnerships and getting creative. And I just think of it as assembly. Like, I'm just assembling things. I'm assembling an expert in marketing and making money. It's like arbitrage. It's like drop shipping. I'm drop shipping experts. Yeah, drop ship.com. What is the I don't want to say the biggest one like that, but what a lot of people who are and I probably should have started with this, but I'm new to this. Um, most of the people, not most, but there's a lot of people in the DMs that are mid6 figure already, high seven figure a month guys that are like in my world. So like yeah, zero to 10k guys a lot of time want to know how they get in the space, how they do that. For sure. Like I think that's a great model. I mean clearly we did it. I mean I didn't directly do it but I was part of it. But what do we like? How do we need to convince anybody else? Like people are what are you doing? Like you think you have to do client work. Oh, I got to do my freaking client work, dude. Client work on the side to fund your publishing deals. That's what I did. And now I don't have clients telling me to do anything. I own everything. I can fire my experts and put a new face on it, which I'd never do. But like, well, that's where I'm going to go with this right now. So these six, seven figure guys are like, "Okay, cool. That's that's fun." Uh, or like we already did this and now we're here. So question for you direct. And we literally went got in a Twitter funniness debate. Oh yeah. What was that about? Depth. It's like why are you doing 14 of these when you can have one with one face or three faces and do five or 10 million a month? What's you have to ask yourself what's the purpose of that deal? Um some products if you own 70 Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's here's the thing. Um there's Yeah. Yeah. So it's all about like where are you going towards? Like what's your mission? Like I I think of things differently where there's some markets I want to be in. Like I'm I'm a creative person. So you have to ask who you are as a person. Like you you can sit at your desk from 5:00 a.m. till now and grind for one person, not get bored. We're only 14 hours in for one person, right? You can do that because you're not like me on the wealth dynamics from a creator and I'm thinking a million different offer ideas all over the place. Like me and Mark, we are more so the creative people. We're see dude we want to be in everything. And we get bored if we're in for one thing. And so some people I envy it. I envy it. I think so. No, but here's the thing. I envy you cuz I wish I could just sit with one person. That's always greener, brother. Exactly. So here's the thing. Why don't I stick with one? Well, who are you as a person? I'm just not that person. So what do I do? What do I do? I broker deals now to people who are. So I can why like why say no to a deal when I can broker and keep 10% of the profits and hand it to a publisher who's going to be like you and be like Luke and scale it up. Now I have a farm, a portfolio of offers in every single market. And so I just did this the other day. Are those paying out? Yeah. Yeah. I mean Mark, that's what Mark did. That's how I learned it from him. Like all his offers he Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayor, he brokered the deals. And so you like So let's get let's get raw. Like so you won't say exact numbers, but like you'll have a five, a 10, a whatever just like hit the bank B like from these different ones like month over month. Yeah. Yeah, cuz I mean usually the first month month when you launch um that's the biggest payout comes because we only work with like like this initial off the bat you see these big spikes. We launch with organic people and then once they go right cuz we're not just doing cold right away. So big launch sometimes I just want the money from the launch. I'm like hey I'll take a bag right there. Then it'll go down and then they'll scale back up with that money. And so there's a big spike and then a dip but then it can pick up depending on how the operator is. And so I was going to say that cuz that's the next layer. It's again like I kind of want to go into that like is this depth thing and that's what we talked about. That's what we talked about in that. You didn't let me finish talking about why I don't why like we can talk more about like why I work on multiple. You talk you can talk about the the number one comment on the Eddie one is I talk too much and I said this isn't an interview and so I'm just going to shut up because it's not an interview. No no it's all good. It's good. People like this bro it's more engaging than just like a boring like well it's just like I don't I don't Yeah. We don't need to know. You can go anywhere to find stories and lists and that and whatever. We're just shop. We're just chat. We're just talking just how I talk to you in person, you know. Um, but yeah, who are you as a person? I'm just so you have to think, are you the creative type or you more the operator? Are you more of the entrepreneur or the integrator? It's like the E-Myth book. You can kind of figure out who you are. Um, but I started off as a person who's operator. I just dialed in on one. Like my first deal was with someone in the interior design niche. Um, so not like super random niche, this interior designer lady who had an interior design business. And um, she didn't do like it wasn't like bizop. it was more like helping with the actual design and the creative stuff and whatever. And so that was the first person I locked in with. I only focused on that one deal and I just scaled that up until she wanted to have a baby and wanted to move on something else and then I she had a baby and I jumped on the next one. So ideally all the deal like I tried to be the operator. I was like I'm going to stick in this one thing. But the way I had to like stay focused I had to do consulting calls on the side cuz I was just just itching to do other stuff. So, I had to create a way to be creative. And so, I that's where I did, you know, hundreds of calls on Zoom one-on-one. Uh, anywhere from $500,000, sit on a call with somebody, just build out their offers, their business. And so, I that's what allowed me to stay focused. But I finally was like, you know what? Why fight this? Why not just lean into my full creative side and then become friends with people like, you know, Craig, who's one of the fulfillment partners? I, you know, send him deals. I didn't realize that's how you guys were. Yeah. Our student, he's one of our fulfill So, our students broker deals to Craig. So Craig, I think someone broke a deal with like a million followers the other week. Uh it's a new student. Nobody's didn't have any results yet. Broker's a deal. Now Craig, who's a beast, is going to scale it up and the broker is just going to chill and take his cut. So um anyways, who are you? And then some offers too, like the creator, you don't know the longevity of the creator, like the lady who wanted to have the baby. I couldn't predict that she wanted to like retire from her business and do something else. And I had the ability where I could have taken the offers and the assets and put a new face on it. Actually had their competitor want that, but I was friends with this wife and husband and like they're sending me pictures of them when they have the baby and we're talking about vacation together. It's like dude, I'm not going to like do that to them. So I didn't do that enough. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of messed up. But like a lot of times you don't know longevity. So some offers I'm like okay um I know there's creators and experts willing to sprint for a year or two years I feel like and let's just you know launch um I'll scale as far as they want to and then I'll in back of my mind I'm like how can I put this money into uh something else or other investments like obviously the goal isn't to stay in info forever like you said the goal is to take that money maybe put into real estate or whatever so my mind isn't just like in info like my mentor Mark Lax taught me very well that the point is to build like for people like me build a business KPI it outsource sell it and then dump that money to something else. Like he did that with his info offer. He sold it for 5.2 uh 5.2 million, dumped most of it at Bitcoin at like 9K or 25K and now he's just chilling and now he's publishing deals for fun cuz he's bored and just vibing. And so obviously it's like he still is publishing, but who are you? What's the point of the deal? Like one of my offers, the point of that offer is to buy our house. It's like this offer, it's a lifestyle offer. It's going to pay for our house. Oh man, that is a page out of the book, bro. Literally, I mean Allan is so funny with that. He'll be like, "Oh, like I want to buy this launch an offer." It's so smart. I mean, he even told me he's like, "This is a mind game." In a good way. I mean, good way. Allan, shout out to Allan. He he told me he's like, "Josh, buy buy a house, pay off your debt, then go freick do whatever and go in other markets." Like he's like, you know, do other stuff, use info as cash flow to get other stuff. And so, you in the house? Are you in the house right now? We we could we have the we can get the like the down payment, but the market's like, frick. And also, do I want to take care of house? I want to go to events and travel. I'm like, frick, I'm 23 and my wife and I want to go to Disney all the time and just vibe. Married at 23. I love that. You're all you're ahead of the game in every aspect. Uh, all right. So, let's get tech. Let's get technical. So, or more so scale. Let's take that to the nth degree and understand why. Yeah. Why do you think they pump and then they stop or drip after? And why do you not go the next layer? Because, okay, everything is the funnel, right? Everything is a funnel. Everything has ascension tracks. Everything has deeper LTV depending how you look at it. I use the example all the time that's like the life insurance guys, right? For example, you pick that niche, you sell info, coaching, whatever on the front. That's amazing. You get your 3x rorowaz whatever and you're chilling. But what you really do is then you get them. So like a lot of the examples is they sell it, they teach you how to like, you know, retire taxree or do this or that or whatever. And then where they really make all the money is they teach you about this account you can get and it's life insurance. They get massive commissions and instead of getting a 3:1, they get a 30 to1 and they do it in all these other ways. Okay? I know these other guys that do it with an agency on the back. I know other guys that do two-sided marketplaces that teach info and then they sell the person basically because they're then trained that like in any of these offers that do this. Your next step in my brain and like well I don't understand the is you have it, it's built, the offer is there and then like you said, you pass it off to the po to like a fulfillment partner or whatever. But like that's almost where that growth operator arm comes into it where you can still own because I I seriously I don't understand like I mean I get what you're saying but at some level is like wouldn't you want to pull back instead of trying to do 10 of them do two or three of them or do one of them to start get your creative thing get all your whatever and don't move on to the next one until you implement you install an operator. There are there are there are literally info and coaching companies that teach people how to be operators and then sell them do the two-sided marketplace. You could literally be a partner on the back end of that info like this in thing. But like why would you not do that and then have them chill at a million a month instead of doing a million and then 100k and then 5 50k and then just dance around that and make like a one hundth. Um I mean first thing would be because I didn't know I didn't see what was possible. Like you can only go as far as you can see. Oh for sure. No that's not a that's not a No. Here's the thing. This is this is this Yeah. So people now know like the the benefit of the publishers we teach now and looking at my story is they're seeing like the next level to this. So let me the next offer. So like the main offer the main thing like that legacy offer I call it like my legacy offer that we're scaling. We're we're working on that. My other deals are just funding it. They're cash flowing it. So all these other smaller deals my portfolio anything else I do is funding this other offer. When before I launched this offer, I architected it different than just a domain. Instead of looking at the domain or whatever, I looked at it from an economic or financial model. I said, I want there to be info. I want there to be ecom. I want there to be software. And I want there to be lead genen. So, I want to be a lead genen company for someone else. Those are my four requirements. And then I looked around. I tried to figure out what market, what mechanism, what industry could I do those four things? And we found it. And we have it. And so now I have the person who's the expert building out the product as for one company you want it to do all it's four things. So it in this four four monetization methods for one niche. Yeah. Yeah. So so now our students what we say is here's the thing you can play the launch game or you can play this legacy game and sometimes people need to play the launch game to survive and pay the bills before they can focus on the legacy. So it's like you got to figure out your your situation. Like a lot of people coming into this copywriters freelancers that are kind of barely getting by. can't wait for an offer to scale from zero. And so we've created a path where you can work with someone as an organic audience, get that cash flow, then focus on other stuff. It's like a stepping stone. But for me, the focus now is the legacy offer. And these other deals, they're just funding it. And like I'm brokering deals get me cash flow because then all that those payouts that hit my account, I'm just going to put into this other company I'm bootstrapping. And I'm doing that because this one's going to need more lift and we're not launching to an organic audience. No, that makes sense. So four things you got to before you publish an offer, you want to like think deep. Info, ecom, software, and lead genen. So who could you sell your list of customers to refer people to? So it does it you're selling, you're using all four of those monetization methods. You're going to have a software baked in. You're going to sell products. That's a plan. So you go info to start is low uh low fulfillment costs, right? High profit margins. You do that. Then you add ecom on the back end so that you're not paying cost per acquisition to uh acquire an e-commerce product because you're it's the margins you can you're then selling them physical products. You bring them in info you sell a thousand people you make 90% margin or 99 organic you get the freaking you're selling physical products. What are you sell? And then you're selling them a physical product that's a consumable recurring consumable ideally recurring. Um, there's other ones too in this one. I I don't want to leak like this is but it's like consumable and then there's stuff like household item like a plug and then and then you're trying to plug a software and then software can tie usually can tie into uh info because uh like for you guys like apps, right? If you had an app they're pretty or like Yeah, it's like info through a software. Yeah. And so dude, making software now is so easy with AI. I have a friend who um he he has an offer coming out soon called automatic apps and he's doing it's like bisop but it's definitely the next wave where instead of selling like PDFs all all these stuff it's selling apps and these like GPTs to build apps. So anyways you can make software so easy now. Um and I can actually get people to build them for free for me because some of the names we're publishing are so big where I'm like hey you want to say you built an app for so and so but anyways um so then you do that and then lead genen. So then my customers, I'm like, who has a service that I not going to compete with that can sell it to? So for us, it'd be a home service industry. So there's a home service niche, high ticket where these people pay for leads. And so our goal, that's where the real big money is going to be. Um, we can either sell the leads or I mean, where you make more money is if I can get a cut of every deal they close from the leads I send. Exactly. Do a partnership deal because I have exclusive providers nationwide. And it's like, you know, Dave Ramsey um does this super well. Like he has Oh, yeah. like real estate bro like, "Hey, our trusted realtors, our trusted financial advisors." And he's playing both ends. That's what I'm saying. So, okay. So, you're going deep on this one. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You have to. This is the I'm buying the house with one of the offers. The other offers fund the freaking other this deal. This deal is one that that's the big boy game or the bigger and then that's where you mature. That's where you get all the money, bro. Yeah, I'm trying to be the best student as possible and like I can only go out to here, but like you can go hundreds of millions with that alone. Like that's what's here's the thing. I think the hardest lesson I'm going have to learn like this is going to be the hardest thing I ever do because I'm going to have to be okay with being bored and I have to be disciplined and like waiting for the long-term payout because I'm not going to be able to jump around. But the thing that keeps me excited is I know okay if we get the info to this then I can do the ecom and then we seal the ecom and it's like milestones. Yeah. It's creative inside it. So have to be across before I thought it was boring like oh frick I only can do this but I have to stay and what's nice is uh on this deal to give me built-in accountability I gave one of my publisher friends 10% to be like our CMO and consultant because he's stayed in an offer and scaled it to over 50k a day. no high ticket, strictly low ticket. Um, guy, yeah, Doug, I've interviewed on my channel. I can't say his last name. Um, and he stuck with one lady who was like a nobody. And so he he told me he's like, Josh, he's the one kind. He's like, you have to like, let's lock in. He's like, you want built one, if you want you want built accountability. Okay. Obviously, I'm like, dude, come on this offer. Because he's got so much experience. And so I got you can still be creative. You can still go off, you can bop around, you can scratch the edge. Like I call it like interest mapping or doing whatever. Like I'll go start a drop shipping store and run it and do 100 grand in a month and just like cuz I want to on a weekend. Like I do that stuff and like I broke even on that by the way. I did not make money. But like I just was like curious. I hadn't run ads in a long time. I hadn't built Shopify in a long time. I didn't know what themes were cool and like I just wanted to do it and like Can you say what product it was? What can I say? Yeah. What did you say? It was in the dog niche. It popped. It was dope. I just couldn't and I like didn't want to make I didn't want to make like I just didn't want to do the whole gambit. I didn't want to do advertorials and whatever. Mark would crush me in the chat if he heard that. But I just was like I was about 40% of the way bought in and I was doing that and I was like yeah it's just but okay so six six multi6fig and seven figure guys where you actually get value and like talk the economics of this. talk the low low ticket the acquisition the two different talk ascension versus talk liquidation because so I I talked to and let me just preface this I talked to two guys both that are let's call it two three million a month um in info and coaching one is high ticket like way not way high but like 25k call it and then another one is in the 10ishk range both bids high both of them uh both of them were not running low ticket at all. Both were doing BSL call funnels direct and one was doing like DTAish and then uh I was talking to one it was like right in the beginning of this like one of my first couple videos and he starts hitting me up on Instagram. Super cool guy, tons of similarities, all this stuff and he's like, "Oh, I'm about to test this webinar direct to cart thing." And we're talking about, you know, that one company we talked about that does that and then does it to a set and then a close and like does that model where it's direct to cart fixed auto and then they do the ascension, right, for like four times the price on high ticket. So he launched that and he is the other one I'm talking to right now is about to launch the low ticket and is like oh we're just going to do it because it definitely can work for mass market. The question is does something for 37 197 whatever what is the e what are your economics and what is your market match when you're trying to sell something for 25k or whatever because like you do this all the time and like we didn't even touch on that. Yeah. Yeah. So I think I understand your question. We're go with it. Um, are you like you're talking front-end price point? Like what I'm talking about like what are the economics and like what are examples? Yeah. Don't say names because I don't want to be those guys, but like like what have you seen or like what is the scale? Cuz like I kind of talk about ours and ours is whatever. We're in the sub 100 low ticket game for ascension focused. We do nothing around upsells, downells, anything to on purpose because we're trying to push to the call and focus on ascension and it's mapping very well. The biggest thing for us is making sure the net the net CPA stays down and that we can do enough volume to where ascension rate is let's say three or f whatever number you have to sell think about that you have to sell you know 100 a day on average to get five to pop out and when you're trying to do 50 on the back end it's like that math does math unless you have to do so much volume for it to back out. So what do you see? I mean you've done tons of these. You've done ascension ones. You've done fully liquidation. You've done so like what pops cuz talking to the six seven figure guys a month that don't have one of these. Yeah. So I think especi Okay. So let's talk about the book a call funnel right now. Um the best thing like if you're going to go strictly you're doing VSSL and you want to go to low ticket. The thing that has popped and continued to pop is pretty similar to the model you guys are doing where we will have uh front-end $27 product and then we will have two order bumps to try to get our AOV to 50 as close as possible and then we'll go right to book call radios like you're going to do like one option or the other or the other one's a bundle or what? No, they're two different products. So there's three products total in this funnel. Yeah. How do you anchor them? The pricing pricing I mean for the bumps. Yeah. So like one your core is 27. How do you The other ones were the other uh price points we did were usually $17 and $22. Um sometimes we've done higher and those can get a take rate of anywhere from 50 to 55%. Um what was the AOV on it? I can just see here I have a calculator. Yeah. What was the AOV on it? Is um 35. 40 bucks. That'd be crazy. I got a This one was in You can just riff. It's fine. Yeah. No, I I have my I have this financial plan I can share. I don't know if you guys want this, I can share at the end by I saw it. I saw your I literally was on your Facebook today and saw it. Yeah, I have this whole like tracker where I can like play the numbers and map out. What is it? What is it? Just give me rough numbers. So, it was 22 and then it was 22. So, like 5% taker on the front end. You'd be closer to like a 40 40 to 45 AOV just on like the $27 front end. $17 order bump one $22 order bump uh number two. And those all those are both around 50% take rates which is very easy to do like getting a take like order bumps are so easy to sell bro don't overthink them just slap in there pre-check bump uh you could do uncheck you could do pre-check yeah on go high level I think you can do that savage you just do pre-check uncheck it if you don't want it the refunds people see it they know you have to see you're not like doing anything gray hat like before they see the complete order it's checked um none of my funnels have pre-checked bumps just to be there. I just know people who do it. And for all the dark lords out here like that kind of stuff, there you go. Mine do not cuz I'm in ClickFunnels and you can't do it. So, exactly. I was like, um, so yeah, $27 front end 1722 $40ish AOV. Um, and then right to book a call. And so, usually, you know, you can and then right to book a call. That's your That's your dude. And guess what? You got someone who's even easier if you got a high a VSSL that's already cranking. I'm gonna take this what I did. All I did this for career consulting in the data like job placement industry. We took the freaking and I did this for uh accountants too. So two different industries just to give context. I took their VSSL I transcribed in dscript. I took that over to freaking AI and was like study this whatever. I said like remember this back when there's projects. Then I took my little low ticket funnel template for copy and I like came up with a product idea like ah we're going to call like the something master class because my thing I sell master classes on the front end which is like a webinar pretty much and I just made the funnel like I just took their existing all their stuff that's already hitting all their hooks is already in that VSSL they've already proven out and then we had the low ticket ready to go. So all you guys who have VSSL funnels don't overthink the messaging like don't seems you produce an actual low ticket product from it. No, I had the I just told the person to make a master class. I'm saying all the copy the angles were all validated because it's coming from their existing VSSL. Yeah. Anuk was talking about it at the event and he was saying how they'll bolt like similar to that. So they'll run like a low ticket funnel and then on the like post it's like oh you qualified for this bonus, you got this free master class and then just dropping them in the webinar or the whatever. Yeah. That's interesting on the email. I usually did a little later if you're doing book a call like with what he's doing. I think is he pitches a book a call at the end. No, he does mid ticket at the end of the webinar. But if you're doing high ticket um and you don't have a mid ticket, then I would just do book a call. Try to push for that on an upsell page and the thank you page in case like, hey, you didn't get to book your call, do it again. And then you run the 1 hour fast start, which we talked about in the last podcast we did. Um and I can share swipes on how I position that. I can send you the emails like how do you position a 1hour fast start ascension webinar to your list? Um, and that's you just just for context, that's you sending an email at post-purchase of a low ticket where you're pushing them to an automated webinar. Automated and then obviously automated webinar generally speaking, what you just said is CTAing to a book a call for high ticket generally or software. Yeah, I mean I've done both. Or software. Yeah, dude. We've never done mid I mean that's not true. Not never, but we've never I say it again. We've we have never done it truly. Uh we've never done any webinars. We've never done any mid ticket. For me, it just does like doesn't We did a mid ticket over the phone. It was like 1,000 bucks, 1,500 bucks. But it uh it's so hard to segment out the offer other than the whole like especially in our like in some of these niches, it's hard to do like done for you, done with you, done do it yourself for your industry. Well, it's just harder, right? Because it's like you give away everything, which is fine. And then like the other one is accountability and that stuff's a that's a done for you. So it's like that's why it's not done, you know, like the highest you can go is done with you. You can't ever get done. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can in your industry. You're thinking for Here's the thing. You know what's so stupid? Here, I'm going to you let's argue on Twitter on this. All right. Done with you and done for you are the same thing. I'm sick and tired of here. You know what I'm saying? Here's the thing. We're saying the same thing. Yes. You know, but let's just change for the audience. You guys are out here. Oh, how do I done for you? He's like, bro, shut the freak up. You're done with you is literally done for you. You know why people are paying you? Oh. Oh, here we go. We're going to talk about the difference. I'm going to tell you how to freaking sell the crap out of done with you offers like you're done. All right. So, they're the same thing. When someone pays for a done with you offer, what are they paying for? Well, they're paying for you to make decisions for them. All right? They want to save time and energy, right? For thinking. That's why I was sold hundreds of consulting calls because all these people wanted me to think for them. I wasn't building their funnel. I wasn't writing their copy, but I was thinking for them. Now, we have chatbt that can do a lot of thinking for us. So that's going to eliminate a lot of things. But so funny. This is a done with you offer. You can you can easily curate GPTs to have good stuff. So you can do that. But here's the thing. Whenever I think the biggest mistake people do with their backend done with you stuff is they sell it like it's done with you. They're like, "Oh, you get these coaching calls and you get 50 calls a week and then there's support blah blah blah." No. Your bullet should be listing out all the things and all the areas where you're going to be thinking for them. So one of the ways we make it so good is they hate reverse. Boom. I'm thinking for you here. We're going to do this for here. And then the way you do it is on calls. But so many times people butcher and they're like I'm like well I will say I will say there is the mechanism is sometimes relevant in how you can sell it because if you are selling it in a in a group setting versus a onetoone setting there is a large value difference. And then to go even further the who the onetoone is with is different. So imagine I I I explained this in some kid's tweet that did not ask for my opinion. Um but he was like talking about like tweets you reply to probably. Yes. I just got to chill. I gota I got to get off all this [ __ ] Yeah, bro. Got it's like you just found the internet for the first time. Like my replies from having so much dude I sat a cave for like 10 years. Leave me alone. Um but I literally responded. It was like how do you guys all have time to do that? Like I can make a couple hundred grand doing uh onetoone coaching or group or whatever doing coaching. Why don't I do it? or like how do you guys have time for it or something. And I was like, "Yeah, the value ladder is like essentially onetoone coaching with you." Yep. Group coaching with you, onetoone coaching with a coach, group coaching with a coach. And like, dude, you're talking like 1K, 5K, 10K, 40K dep, you know, whatever the math. And that's real. Like if someone, you know what I mean, like people are, you know, ask you, I'm sure, or whatever, or like me or these other people like, "Oh, let's do consulting." Think about the time like the difference in that. Oh, for sure. So big. And so is it for the person if they're going to sign up. So that's where I think the mechanism is important when you're saying done with you or done for you. And I also think it's very important to talk about which one it is unless you can sell it without because if you can sell it at the same price as what one onetoone with you is and have the same service delivery but the cost of a group doing it because like the model there is like one to one is all your time. One to group is your time with many, right? So like you get leverage. The next layer introduces real cost not time cost. So now it's like dollars because you're paying a team or breaking them off somehow. And then it's like onetoone with them is 20% of the service. Call it is like industry standard but can be less depending on how high ticket your thing is. And the next one is like like 5%. Or less 2%. It's like you start to get into like info margins with coaching because you have one coach for 30 in a cohort or whatever and they're all paying three grand or whatever the number is and like it it works out to you know a coach still making 70 90 whatever the math is. Like you can math it well. Yeah. Yeah. But and I mean that's what's beautiful is I mean on our freaking upsell book a call scripts we leave it pretty open. Like we just sell the outcomes of what we're thinking for them and then on the call it dictates where we put them call the sales call like it's up to the application cuz and you just anchor down group and one. Yeah. Because I mean ideally I mean I'm trying to get somebody like to my highest paid thing where I can make the most amount of money but not everyone can afford that. So I have other options where it's the like the group or with a coach or do you sell onetoone with you? I have that. I mean not as I did before like I was just doing Google doc and a calendar link and yeah and you just do you just walk through like it's just you for sitting there bro just sitting there one hour what do you want me to build and I tell you what here's your front end here's your order bump two. Boom. Boom. Done. Leave. Um, dude, I was doing like five something six calls a day. Six new businesses. I come upstairs, my wife can just tell. I'm just like dead. I'm like, you're upsell front end. It was so many. And making a couple like couple G's a day just like popping these off for fun. And like that's I said I had to scratch the itch, bro. And I think, dude, it's so tempting to go back to it because it's like it's such fun money, but again, like you said, you got to go deep in other things. I I close it down for now. But I mean people still they come they're like I'm like you keep raising your price. I don't know. I mean someone like you who has that like creative and can like in that way. I think it's cool. I have a business coach that I hired that it like does a ton of lead genen guys and it's like a whale in this thing and uh I meet with him. I did every other week. So I do I had it today but we were going through the stats of like I like come you know fully loaded to talk about all this stuff and I'm basically like he's like you know wins and I'm like boom boom boom boom boom like I just how I work. And I was like all this inflow though in my inbox like everyone's asking for consulting everyone's asking for this or that and I'm like what you know so we literally talked out exactly what we're saying like what are the monetization methods possible what is the and I just kept saying I was like I just want to build the moat deep I just want to keep going moat I don't want to like think about that I don't want to have my time there I don't want to do anything and the second I accept a dollar from somebody I am like oh my god like this is how I I'm going to do everything in my power I don't have the like oh do I mean like and it's not speaking bad on it but like if someone was like oh I want to pay for an hour for 10G or whatever the number is like and I sat there and I would do 10 hours I would do 500 never stop because I would be like until I know that someone made like true 100 grand in 10 like this it's just how I I don't know it's just I never done it probably like a limiting belief but I just don't and he was like what are the other monetization methods he was like is it partnership is it equity deals is it whatever I'm like yeah I mean the big play is like some hormosi level thing but he deploys teams so then you have leverage issues because it's not just your time. Iman told me about the guy that has uh he makes, you know, over eight figures a year doing getting equity as his monetization method and his fulfillment is group coaching with companies that he has equity in. Imagine that you have like two time slots a week Tuesday and Thursday for two hours and you're and you're equity owner, you know, I mean like companies does like crazy, dude. It's pretty much up here again. These guys have like teams they deploy and do all this stuff, but like you talk about leverage on leverage sometimes. Not really. They just say that to look cool, but most times you're just group coaching them. Like it's just a whole new like cuz we have in our program Yeah. We have we have people in our program who like sold their companies to people like Hermosy and it's so I was like oh that's all that's it you little group co. I'm like sick dude. So that's why like for me when I broker deals now like I'll say like I'll jump on a call with a company maybe every other week for 30 minutes an hour and I'll just say blah blah fix this blah and I'll leave. I'll be like a CMO kind of give some strategic stuff and make sure everything's good. But yeah, it's it's there's definitely a play there. So, um yeah, that's another sick model and that's a very cool model because that's where it's like you just keep going down this, you know, the depth thing I I talk about. It's like how do you go within this scope versus No, bro. That's one of the things like especially when I was doing the consulting stuff I my how far I could see I mean it was strategic for a play to publishing and getting deals like it was the lead genen for getting into companies and getting into offers and I have this whole intention with it but I know like going deeper with it there's so many ways it could have and still dude I seriously think and and you already said you actually said this to me and then I just validate I agreed with what you said so this is not my idea but you were like oh I need like a you know an operator partner I need something like that because if you could have you You almost have to leave them behind though if you're going to do it right. It's like you need a you need a pool of them because you need to go like deploy be side by side have this person like run it and then you go do the next one and then cuz they you know that person can't jump with you unless they're No, you have to you have to have a they replace themselves and like that's true. You see a lot of those guys where it's like two guys um I'm trying to remember who but there's this other guy that does like a private equity style play like holding co play and his partner is a very technical like integratory style guy but he's at such a high level that he can like go in understand it set up whatever and replace himself and then travel with you guys are both going offer to offer and he's replacing that's the dream I'm still looking for that dude that's but like I don't even think I need that dude with this next that gives me like anxiety like I have nowhere close to that you know what I mean like thinking of like leaving that behind new your email address, your Slack, your whatever, and it's like move to the next one. It's like, bro, I wouldn't do that with info, like online. I would do that like my buddy, he does that with home service businesses. Yeah. And he's a marketer. And so he like gutter business. He went so deep with that automate. And he comes to me, he's like, "All right, I'm done with that business is moving." He does his wife business and he's like, "What do I do now?" And I'm like, "I don't like the model." But it's like, it's not info. It's offers that you don't want to do it with. It's not that you don't want to do it with info. Oh, there are plenty of infoation or whatever businesses that have a lot of legs long but it's like the dynamic like I would if I'm going to do it like that I want a business that's more static I guess I'd say where I can it's very operator can keep doing the same thing over and over versus like info like yes they have a lot of legs but you're revising the angles and the scripts and the positioning it's like that's fine but you have to have a really creative operator inside somebody's doing that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like you got to have you have a home services business and you've got freaking payroll and trucks breaking down and this and that. I mean, I get it. Everything has everything, dude. There's always problems on both sides. It's what are you willing to problem? So, if you have to have a you have to have a fractional CMO that goes across all your companies and has to do new angles. I think it's a little maybe a little better than your mass inventory. But here's the thing. I mean, with AI, I guess I guess with AI, you can the creative thinking is going to be replaced very fast. So, I guess there's ways you could do that, too. How are you using that? I don't use it at all. That's not I don't I don't use it at the like I got so whenever I see all these guys talk about it and like I use it for these guys here. Let me tell I see behind these things. All right, let me tell you something. What? just you know the guys on X talking about AI and they're talking about oh how deep and oh look at my they send you a screenshot their n and this system does this and it does this and that they aren't even using them like okay if they have a really crazy one they don't have a business that they're normally really using in right now I mean dude it's a best engagement bro it's just because and then guess what you look at you're like oh my gosh I'm so far behind in AI I need to pay them they know how to do all this with AI I got to pay them it's just the same as prompts. My buddy ran the biggest AI prompt offer back in the day and he had a whole notion thing of prompts. Everyone's like, "He's so far ahead." And then we're like, "Wait, you can just have AI make those prompts." You realize the moat's not that big. And so like most of these guys like, so don't I think the biggest thing I tell people is you don't if you start getting a place like I'm too I'm far behind. Look at all these guys. Like nah, you're not that they're not even that far ahead of you. Well, I think the biggest thing for me is and you can use it in simple ways. Yeah. I had two three calls today. I did like I still do like the vendor research side of our tech for uh so like I I just like to pick that still and it's I probably should get out of it but like I like to know it's like come to it with it's like it's a little bit higher level right and uh I'm essentially trying to solve for source of truth with all of our data and then a AI roll out of basically uh replace and enhance all of our automations first because we have whatever three millions apps and then the next layer is to replace and enhance roles and like responsibilities and stuff, right? start with all the tech and start by doing that and then do it on roles and like efficiencies and systems and the general like consensus of today was my understanding of what AI can do that automation can't is very limited like I can't right like I understand that it can do that and it can do it like a little better or whatever it can have like and how somebody explained it to me was essentially like you have triggers then you have actions and automations more or less right obvious but with AI you have triggers infer is what they kept saying. It infers and then it has actions. So, it's basically like it can do like its own contextual things. And again, like that makes sense when you hear it like that, but like how do you put that into practice? I still I'm that's where I mean I'm uneducated. I don't necessarily need to know how to like click the button and run it. I need to know it's possible so I can then do it because that's where I'm trying to reach is like the point of leverage now where I can like have these conversations and we're like, "Oh, that sounds amazing." and then someone goes and builds it and because like I'm trying to reduce the right now like production ends at the end of my fingertips and like I want it to end like through other people and like through team that's trying to like stack the scale and I'm not there yet in close but like I think I mean one I because I dream up ideas like that where it's like man if what if AI could do this or whatever and then I just go to chatbt and I ask it what tools could do it and I just like come up with it and I find a lot of like stuff that way so there's always a tool for it I'm like oh wait I could build this and it used to be seem super hard and now I just ask chatbt tell me the exact stack I need or AI stack to build a thing that does this and then I say step by step how do I set it up step by step yeah what is the walk through literally bro and I'm like boom we're like coded like we're coding a job board right now for our like talk about going deep with offer publisher um that's a whole another we had a whole another side so like we're doing stuff like that I'm like I don't want to I was like can AI can you make this and it's like oh use lovable and then do this and then use this for the datab Easy. I'm I don't I'm not a tech person. That's why I do like X though. I mean, you're right. Like, there's obviously the farms or the crypto farm guys who like, oh, you know, Chad GBT taught me how to make a trading bot that did this and like they just do it for followers and all that stuff. Now they do it with NAN, now they do it with whatever. There is one there's a couple like I follow some of the uh what's his name? Like the EP guy like he's a G. Yeah, he's a G. Yeah, I mean there's like those guys. So, it's like you got just like anything, you know, there's people I asked that N question. It's the my number one. It got like I don't even know 300,000 or something like impressions. And he hit me up like instantly. thing. He's like, "What are you trying to build?" And I was like, "My guy, thank you." And we went back and forth and he was like, "Yeah, don't buy my stuff cuz if you want it." Mine is like his was more on like true prompting and like whatever. All this stuff in this direction and mine was more about automations, enhancement stuff. And he was like, "Go this direction." Gave me three people. Like that's the kind of like not even try. I mean, again, he's only going to make whatever he's going to make. If I was to buy his thing and like instantly points me in the other direction. I'm like, that's another legit. That's a real Yeah. So that's legit. Yeah. What's uh Let me go through these comments on this. So, the what do you what do you think most people get dead wrong about launching a low ticket offer? Oh, frick. There's so many. Um I already have like three in my brain. Okay. You sell obviously the biggest one is you're selling a product on the front and that attracts the wrong person on the back end. Example, super easy. But it's like that's so real, right? Because Okay, I made this mistake. Let me give you a story. one of my one of my offers um that I published the second offer I ever published. So like meaning I'm a publisher get a cut expert second one so I'm you know I'm still newish I was really thinking about this but his backend offer was coaching group coaching style thing and so it's coaching information whatever on the front end I decide to sell a tool a process plug-andplay that's it and then we somehow are trying to make the connection on the back end where it's like oh if the process breaks then we're here to coach for you and it's like what the freak we're literally devaluating like what they just bought. Yeah. And you did the done for you upfront for $12. Yeah. What the freak? And so you sell the wrong thing or you sell tools like if you sell tools on the front end that's funny. Yeah. So you do that that's wrong. Um an explainer behind that. That's because you flip the model, right? And yeah, flipped it backwards. It should have been selling a model on the front end, tools to do the model faster, and then the coaching helps you faster. Yeah. So here's how I fixed it, though. I just sold even more done for you stuff on the back end. So tool, you can sell tools on the front end, but your upsells have to be more tools or done for you setting up that tool. It's additional tools. So that's a big uh I like Allen's explainer of that, which is like you're basically just selling the same exact information, right? Is like the easy way to say it. Yeah, you can do that information and it's up. Yeah. Well, no, like no, just like the different layers of implementation and the easy way to say it. Yep. Yep. And so like that's the biggest one I see people do. Um oh low ticket thinking that I mean today's world I made I made a post on this but people who complain when it's not liquidating on the front end and they're like oh it just broke what's up. What do you target? Sorry your video's it might be mine but your video. What do you What do you target on the on liquidation on the front end? I mean the biggest like our biggest ones they're at like 3 point4. your biggest ones in what were your biggest at scale profitable like like money being made profit on the back end because to at scale it's like you can deep try to make your front end convert right and write really good ads and you're trying to squeeze these little percentage increases to get a few more dollars on the front end when you should spend all like majority of your time on the back end right making the profit up on a high ticket other offers recurring mid ticket whatever like the big that's I made a post on this and I consult a lot of offers So, you know, some of these aren't ones that I'm running actively, but you know, they're doing they're like they're happy when they have like a.3 and as long as they're getting 100, you know, 150 200 on the front end because they're like, "We don't give a crap. We're going to sell all this in the back." What I will say is very interesting. We I I had Eddie on before the uh as my last one and talking to him and he in the thing was in the video was talking about how low ticket is the like model that they are least experienced in and they're like big boys, right? Like, you know, everyone's like, "Oh, whatever." They don't do Okay, they do 1.5 billion in client and generated revenue. They do whales that he won't even say their name like at dinner because they're so big. So, everyone can offer their Oh, he does, you know. Yeah, he does over 10 a week in client generated. Okay. So, um Yeah, I was going to say something jokingly mean, but I'll hold it back. Yeah, exactly. We're all just being nice here. And, uh it's like he was talking about how a majority of what they do are DTA style and that they're trying to get into it. We were talking about our low ticket after actually and we've never we've never done it up until recently and for us it's exact model what you're saying. I literally I still to this moment I said this to you the other day. I couldn't tell you right now what my liquidation percentage is. I could tell you my net CPA like that. But I couldn't tell you like what percentage it is because I don't know that like off the top and like my math but it doesn't matter because if I know my net CPA and I know my ascension rate like literally to the 0.00% I can tell you it right now for last month. I can tell you for last quarter. I can tell you it for last month isolated to last month and back end. I can tell you last month isolated to overall. I can tell you all of them. And like that's the those are the two numbers that matter, right? Because if you have a $100 net CPA and you have a $100 net CPA and a 5% uh ascension, you have a $2,000 CPA, your backend product net. Yeah. And if you're selling a $10,000 thing now, it's just about volume. Yep. And like but the issue is a lot of the time the volume and what are the other issues when you sell the wrong thing and it doesn't get the 5% ascension. If you sell the to the wrong person who is not the person who's going to send to the back end. What else? Um and then I would say I mean those are two big ones. And then I think too many upsells they kill the high ticket sales process. Uh if you're doing high ticket on the back end um that's oh frick here's another one. big one. Front-end product. Um, this is a big one. You people just throw random stuff together and they don't realize that their front-end product is probably one of the biggest me like mechanisms in the ascension process like to get people ascending. Um, how so? Some people focus too much on teaching stepby-step stuff or super educational like long courses or even like books when I found it was better to yes give them fast things to implement if we're teaching a model but increasing belief through the product and so uh obviously I mean low ticket I think the consumption rate is pretty low. I think 10% of the people will actually complete or consumer load to get offer is what we've seen. It depends on what it is. If it's a tool, it can be higher. So, you're not not a ton of people, but those 10% are great on a phone process. And so, I think a lot of times people throw ramps together. They uh they like miss that real estate there of attention because you know how important consumption is, right? And how it's so hard to get people to consume. That's I think our number one thing I would I would argue that that probably is our like like why it's helping our like moat almost. Yeah, bro. I see your emails and it's like more videos and you got your website. I'm like frick like all it is and none of it is cold. None of it which is dumb also by the way. Like we still have not put enough focus, energy, whatever to master using that content for cold acquisition or for like first click and like us on the back end. But it's huge in because I look at I even look at your stuff. I'm like, "Hm, no." Okay. No crazy claims now. I'm like, "What?" But I'm like, "Fick, there's so many like videos and blogs and Yeah. It's like we're direct response, but not right." Yeah. You don't don't look like it. You don't look I've seen direct. It's like, dude, and like I So funny. We're talking about doing a more cold focused low ticket and it's like, "Oh, let's use this time frame and this, this, this." And it's like, okay, the only way you're using a time frame is if you're talking about like you're not talking about you're not getting a result in a time frame. Like no way. you'll finish this course in seven days. I don't know what you'll get. Seriously, like no joke. I literally was like, "Yeah, you can have it implemented in a week. You can do this." And like we actually found one and I think we're going to go that way and I'll send it over once we frame. There's a but it's not a result at all at all because I'm like we're not doing that. The entire like one whole portion of this I think honestly for every thing I do into the future and this is a bold claim so like maybe not but whoa I I think that I think it gets better customers. I think it gets higher value. Like I think it all the things that you want out of a customer. Y it's harder to sell, but if you have the results, you have like the conviction, you have all these different things that you can still get people into your thing, they are just so much better if you're not quick fixing them and like finance selling that and like doing all these things and you know there's time and place for finance for agreed but the you know there's just so many reasons I think that is a better customer. Y and all our entire thing is like that's why we don't crack on New Year's and like we should. There's still a way to do it in a good way. That's not like new year, new me, complete brand new cuz like we don't subscribe to that. Yeah. Subscribe. Subscribe. We don't do either. I you know what I mean? Like we just don't. Yeah. You don't. And you can Here's the thing. It's so funny because just today I was thinking about this. I walked into the basement of our apartment. I see this guy I know who's our neighbor and he's like, "Oh, what's up?" He's like, "What do you do for work?" And I'm like, I always tell people I run a a marketing agency cuz that's the easiest thing to explain, right? Same. He's like, "Do you sell those like PDFs, those like faceless PDF stuff where it's like make money passive income crap?" And I'm like, "No, bro. I know Ch." He's like, "Yeah, I don't trust that." Like he's going off and I'm like, "Okay, there's a huge segment of every market where the claims do not resonate with them." Like he will never purchase anything with a claim. And all a lot of marketers think that's the only way because yes, there is a market that will respond to it. No, you can one of the most underserved. I think this is there's there's actually real we got we got three underserved markets big. All right. Number one is just markets that don't respond to claims because we've been serving claims forever. There's a whole segment you think about, you know, only 20% of the people on the sales call close and I get 5% conversion rate my low ticket front end product. like a majority of those people who are aren't converting might be in the market like if it's a claim offer then they're not responding to that so we're missing out on them so someone else can go capitalize on it like you guys are the other underserved one is female market and especially in things that relate to bisop of course one of the biggest really underserved but other segments do what's up you know our friends that do that which one female bizop is the closer one no oh female bizop no we'll talk about there's a few I mean there's like no doxing no doxing but Dock. I'll do stuff. All right. We've got No, we know I know two different ones. I know one that does a physical product and one that does a I'm going to get I'm going to I'm going to get interrupt. I'm going to get yelled at for interrupting you, but this is No, I like it. There are two that I know that took exact models. They literally imagine buying like a whatever MMO course and then literally just layering it with like female language in that way. They did that and they crush an MMO. And then we know another group of guys that are doing it with a physical product that did the same thing and branded all female and specific to them and like in all fairness like it does have results that are specific in different ways for like call it hormonal call it this whatever and both of them print and I mean we do it but ours is within but yeah yeah I mean and I think your market is pretty served um but yeah so there's that and then obviously there's different languages I made a post about this too um which we can talk about like how to license your offer um but Yeah, I think that's a big thing. That's why claims you don't need them to to survive. And then yeah, the female market, bro, that's why I'm telling publishers like, oh, for everyone in the comments, how do I find my expert? Go to someone who has a strictly male-dominated product. Say, hey, I'm going to add an additional whatever you're making a month right now. You know, obviously that's a claim. Don't say that, but I could potentially make you more money with your same product, right? I'll get you more customers. Same product. You don't have to record anyone because I'm gonna bring a spokesperson in. So, uh, we have a student. I'm actually against that model. Let's make it clear for everybody. I'm against that model because Which model? That I don't like the idea. I think of bring it to the female market. Yeah. Why? Like you really I like I like the idea uh for that. It's like same reason that I'm not I'm saying that we weren't like it's the depth game. It's like how dude you can take. Isn't that going deeper? like same product, broadening the market, but you're noting it because you're niching it. You're just double niching. But if you're if you're But if your first product is never going to get that market, you're not going deep there then. But the question is, can you So like use us as an example. It's like where I was coming from was use us as an example. Someone came to us and was like, "Oh yeah, and you guys could be doing, you know, another half a million or a million bucks a month like doing it for men." And it's like it's like oh yeah let me just change everything about the entire or like you're basically yeah let me just dupe everything for what for another million bucks a month. You think I couldn't push this another million a month? All right the TAM again and I understand the TAM champion like we're TAM male and female bro like you're there is a large TAM within that. So that's where I say that but I agree with you if you were to spin something up that is like that which both these guys did. Yeah, it's crushes. Someone was talking about it at uh uh in Vegas. They were like, "Make these for women." Yeah. What the f I mean here, think about Make these women specific like Exactly. Remember the torches of freedom campaign? The what? Torches of freedom. Torches. Torches of freedom. The the like a torch torch, but it was about cigarettes. So, let me tell you, let's tell a little story time. Little story time with Josh. Little OG marketing. All right. Little Oglev Oglev Josh. Oglev Josh coming in. So, there was this man. Let me look up his name here because he's got a he's got a name that I'm like I don't even know how to say it. But there's a man who was hired by the government to get America. This is so fun. My shout out my like it's 7 p.m. Normally I'm done working at 5. My wife is recording music. So I'm I'm just get to geek out. This is she's come home and be like what? See the mic on the counter. She's like who are you talking to? Nothing is different in my life. I swear he's a boy. Um okay. So there's a man who did and he was hired by the government, okay, to make America to get Americans bought in on the idea of World War I to in wars like get us sold like American people bought in. We need to go to war even if we don't really need to, right? Cuz they wanted to recruit people. He was the first person to get into psychoanalysis of people and essentially figure out how to hijack people's desires to make them want things that they don't need. This is be the original direct response marketing and there's this group of people where really they thought like every human has these core desires and you can tap into them to make them buy stuff they don't need and you can get them to want it. So desire aka make them lack it. And so these OG the first person ever before this consumers in America we only bought things that we needed. You you didn't buy extra stuff. Your house was not overcluttered. It was just you got what you needed. You go to the store you need something. You didn't ever leave with extra stuff. That wasn't a thing. But what happened is after the war, we had all these factories. We had all this distribution and people they're like, "Fick, we all these supplies, no war going on anymore. We need to sell this stuff." And so they got one of them was cigarettes. Like cigarettes was a big thing. And they were like unable to push it further cuz only, you know, they were only selling to men. And so this guy comes along and he was like, "Look at you connecting." He's like, "Here we go. Here we go. Let's do a campaign called Torches of Freedom." uh Edward uh Bern Bernese. Yeah, Edward Bernese uh he came up with this campaign and he had there's a parade going on in New York or something. I might be it might not be New York. It was a big city and he hired a bunch of socialites from the city to walk hijack the parade with cigarettes and smoke them and he got reporters and camerafield to take it and so they had this whole publicity stunt and on the ads they called it torches of freedom like women are independent we don't like we can smoke as a sign of freedom and oh women are strong we don't need to do men said right they tapped into this desire this lack and got all these women to buy it and cigarette companies boom exploded sales tapping into female market and so um some products will never hit with males but you can tap into it by a whole different language if you men aren't going to be like yeah torches of freedom like I think I mean I think it's a great like you said at your level you aren't going to do that but for some freelance copyriters watching this right now who's like I want to get in the offer game but I don't know what to sell I don't think freelance copyriters watch this they might get you you're on it n I hate to break it to you man shout out if you're a freelance copyrighter agency owner. You're watching this. I know you are. You freaking swipers trying to get all the campaigns going to hijack. They're trying to dox us, bro. They're going to copy our campaigns. Um, but this is like one of the things they do. And so you can you can go to someone like I don't know to sell. Okay. Go to someone who's already selling something. And then uh one of our publishers, he's uh speaks English and Spanish and he lives in the States. Oh, that's a major play too. And he he did the same thing. He did the same thing. Now, other ones, Germany, uh, France, and then Australia. Dude, Australia is so far behind us. The amount of offers I'm on where it's the most b like would not work in our market because it's just saturated that are crushing in Australia and the CPMs and the CPA is low. Yeah. Yeah. I had a uh female influencer reach out that that is selling like a physical product and info products and has a massive following and she they're doing like super small numbers and it's like sending me some of the stats and I'm like god this is just untapped and it's that Australian whatever and she's like oh yeah I don't pitch it I just have link in bio and I was like you do no CTAs she's like no I do no CTA she has like long form YouTube she has like all the stuff and I was like dude people want to buy stuff from you you know like sorry little side tangent But like people like it's it's interesting. Um but yeah, I know a lot of people interesting. You don't have to make claims and trick people and use grey hat. No, and it's not even that. Like it's literally she has a like legitimate like they made their own physical product that's like this crazy high quality. It's like this beautiful Shopify page. It's not CRO. Like there's no conversion. But cheeks. Yeah. But yeah, but like the actual like product itself looks very high quality. And I'm like you could be slanging six figures of this a month and it's like low five figures. And I'm like what's going on? Like, so I'm going to pop on a call and like help with that. That's what I've been doing. I've just been like popping on calls and like having people send me looms and Google Docs and just respond to it. Like seriously, like I'm going to publish you. Hey, how about No, let me just This is like Let me get this to like a couple hundred first. I'm going to get to No, I'm going to publish Blake next. I'm working on him. I got to send the contract. Stop. I need No, he's going to come on here, too. He asked me if he'd come on here. I'm like, "Of course you can, but like just don't go." I actually almost texted him to interview. I was like, "Don't leave and go do other stuff, please." because No, he won't. He's too locked in. Dude, we just while we're on here, we just passed last month past what 1.2 1.5 more. But yeah, we just passed what our last month is, which is good for us because we've been stuck in that little trap for like two three months. What changed mindset wise? Not tactically. Yeah. Oh jeez, that's a Wait, now you're mentality shifted throughout the team to push those units and numbers. Obviously, my guess is you had new mindsets enter the team that out pushed that, meaning like new hires, correct? Which is also tactics, but you know, mindset leads the tactic, how they frame. So, Ross, I I said this, I think it was yesterday's video or the other one. It it was like, what's the bottleneck is my thing I'm always like, and I do want to ask you that where you think yours is both personally and professionally, which is kind of one and the same for how we operate. But the initial bottleneck, the theory, and that's why I literally say bottleneck theory, is cuz it's like you might think it's something and then solve it and realize you're completely wrong. And like that's why you almost need to try and solve them quickly. Um, but we were, it was marketing, how marketing was set up, how it was structured, how the campaigns were structured, how we were using one ass, you know, one funnel that had already done 70 million, like all that stuff. It was time to change up marketing and how it was led and the mindset and then also the tactics then, right? over or you know downstream and then we changed that we fixed it and we were filling calendars and it was just like not backing out like it was backing out like the volume was the how do I explain that so it was like you know if you were doing 50 calls a day now you're doing 200 calls a day but you're closing at the same rate so like they went up but your cost per stayed I'm listening so like you're listening so like the cost per went up so we did four times more calls and we did four times more units but the cost per acquisition was like not good right like the conversion rate from one to the other was not and we're like oh it's still a marketing issue. I got some NA beers. Um and uh I'm like going through this whole thing and I'm like something is like it just doesn't make sense. And we're like oh it must still be marketing because the quality because the quality because we're testing new acquisition methods. So we're like oh we don't know if the quality is there. And then everything was kind of transitioning and transpiring with sales team and our sales leader that had got us from 1 to 3 million like did crush it for us and helped us in that and then was there when we broke acquisition kind of had to like fend and deal through that which is crazy right you have we had just moved everyone W2 we had done all this stuff and like now the calendars for these reps are half filled we're paying base salaries because everyone's W2 and we're like it'll be fixed in a week and like four months later. So like the morale like you're saying mindset changed. Yeah. And then when and then he went and started his own offer and like we're supporting him fully in that and then we had a new guy come in that XYZ has done you know nine figures in our exact industry in our exact niche in our exact whatever and comes in and then week one just sets the tone like just sets the tone. I love those people and is like here you're going to chat like what are your numbers? Nobody knows their numbers. It's like here are the numbers. No one knows they're this no like whatever. here's how you're going to do this one to ones with everybody on the team. The pass off was like executed amazing by both parties by the sales manager that was leaving that was amazing and then also this guy who came in and like like just crushed it and um we passed through this and literally same lead flow. We actually had I think two reps that like transitioned out or were already kind of on their way out. It wasn't like necessarily due to him um but had them leave and we you know it's let me not fake say this number. Yeah, 140 today. same lead flow. So it's like that's crazy. What I love those bro. Now the question is now the question is is marketing. So what's going to happen is 95 more changes to happen within that department. Marketing can it continue to fill and do it at a cheaper cost per as we go through or maintain cost per basically and do that. Can they then scale into these metrics and the next thing that's going to break is like marketing and all that. So, like that the mindset shift is like I'm telling you doing these videos and stuff and talking this stuff through. I I was talking to Luke about this this morning. I was like I uh I get some comments and some things sometimes that are like and I read everything. I I do I consume it all which maybe is bad but like people are like oh you know just like I don't know ego or like knows everything and all this and let me tell you I do not. But what it does come up when I'm doing one of these a day, like potentially trying trying to teach, it's like I understand it so much more. But I am definitely just like outputting 98% of the day and only consuming like two, which is on its head for what I did for the last 10 years. For the last 10 years, I did not say a word. I did not post a thing. I did not do anything. All I did was consume. That's awesome. Like to a bad point. So it's kind of like I'm just so extreme and I'm doing it this way. Like Luke was like, you need to literally just just like vomit it all for as long as you can. Yes. And then all of a sudden you'll just be like tank is empty other than like what we're doing now almost where I'm at. And then it's like and then the cadence begins. And I'm already there. I'm like I actively say I do not know a lot. I know this much about our industry that's this big. True. And then you go to online business and it's this big and then you go to like general business and then you go to life. It makes you feel so small though. That's why I said at the start of this like I'm still a student. Yeah. I you hear one thing and then you're like you kind of have there's this moment you have to learn how to take it well because I think some people hear it and they can feel so defeated but I I had to learn to take it and be like excited like oh wait I can learn more like I you mean I don't know it all. Yeah it's like I seriously like in business there's one thing and then I I model everything off of other people like almost to a fault. No, seriously. Like a life hack, like a funnel life hacker. Like I will say, and that has actually hurt me in the past when I didn't realize that you had to like Yeah. Well, uh more parts of them than only the part that you were initially trying to. So, for example, I have I have people I know or whatever that absolutely crush it. Crush it. And I'm like, "Oh, I want to be like this person." And it's like I do these things and then it's like, "Oh, you try to do their lifestyle and you try to do this other stuff." And it's like, "Wait, that goes against some other things that I have or maybe not at the time, but it wasn't serving me." And it's like, "Okay." Okay. So, it's like I look at you and no joke, I can be like, "Wow, you're, you know, posted up in this apartment. You have, you know, a wife. You're doing this. You're, you know, your goals are in alignment with that for you guys. You have No, but seriously, like you have that stuff. I look at me and it's like that part is not uh thriving for me, right? Like I spend all this time working. It's where my passion is currently." But like I would look to or who do I look to for that? It's like I look at a Dan Martell and I only know him from the internet, but like I feel like he's somebody who maybe checks a couple boxes in terms of how like his personal is and his business. I look at like a hormone Z and it's like how his life and business he and he clear as day says say says this is not for everyone and it's like I'm kind of operating in that mode right now but like it only works in the relationship dynamic from an outside perspective because they both are like in it doing it. True. Right. So it's like I don't know we're kind of going on a tangent here but like the the personal side of I am it's I'm definitely struggling to find because that's how I learn everything. It's like I want to find somebody who has what I want, who was where I'm at, who works like I do, who is similar to how I am, but then thrives in their in like personal life and that's everything. That's like a partner, sure, but that's also like friends, that's family, that's like where you live, that's how you that how do you give back? How do you do all those things? And like I am on that level right now because I'm doing this over here in work. I I love that you bring this up because I think a lot of people need to hear it because I remember I would get scioped or romanticized certain gurus or experts coming into the game very young. You know, being a 14-year-old kid being raised by bizop gurus of all sorts. Like I followed a lot of interesting people that led paths I'd never wanted. And I think the biggest thing that helped me was yeah learning and hacking the people that I wanted to be like like Mark Lack. He is married young has a kid. Yeah. also has a Urus, has millions of dollars and his big vision, but he's not sacrificing his marriage or his kids. So, I'm like, okay, let me how do you do it, Mark? And let me build like you. But I used to study guys who Miami bros who are which is nothing wrong with it. It's just not exactly. And there's nothing wrong with but you're spoiled the wrong person. And so I think for what you want though because guess what? There's a 14-year-old kid who wants to live in the penthouse in Miami and do it and whether that's life. I had to learn a lesson. I had a kid. Shout out Logan. Um, I'm gonna Can I name drop him because I give him some hype? Last hand. Yeah. Or do we not dox Seful? I mean, I mean, it's up to you, but I want to hype him up because he's been working hard. All right. Logan Jerome. Shout out Logan Jerome. He's next up. He's up. Uh, this kid in Minnesota who's been just locked in. Oh, is that the kid I met? No, that was Isaac. He's also locked in. He's one of another locked in. We got some locked in kids in Minnesota. Um, he's so cool. Shout out Isaac, too. Um, Logan Jerome, he's a kid who goes to my church. He came up, he started loving the agency game. He saw I was on Iman Gazi's channel and he's like, "Yo, like let's talk." And he's the one who actually did what I suggested. But what I found, the lesson I had to learn is I started suggesting my beliefs into his lifestyle that didn't align with what he wanted. And so he was cha going a different path that I just didn't go. But I was hurting I like I realized I was hurting his growth because I didn't agree with that. So I'd knock it. I'd be like, "Oh, blah blah blah blah." And I had to learn to like know he that's what he's doing. Push him towards that. And so as I think for people on here, if you're mentoring, if you're coaching, you also need to learn what do your customers, your students, your clients want and make sure that you're not in like putting your propaganda into their lives because he didn't want to be married at 21. You know, it's like so easy for that to happen. I have I have two I have one friend that I'm pretty like that crushes it that's older that is like kind of like still in just exploration party crushes it does whatever and like nicest but like great all this thing and it's just like there's certain pieces of lifestyle or whatever that it's like okay like not you know my but like it's so like such a good person such a nice person but like just how they live life and like how they built their business model and stuff it's just not in alignment necessarily with like how I'm currently in and it's just like it's difficult sometimes to like peace and part what what piece or you know what what you want to model it off of. Um that's no that's a super I I still am struggling very hard with trying to find someone that I want to and they come like here's the thing you put out the intention and they come. I remember I used to tell my wife I was like I really want to focus on my health but here's what I need. I told her the exact person. I said I want somebody who is entrepreneurial. They're growing their personal training fitness business so we could talk business while we're working out. I want them have similar beliefs being a Christian because I'm I'm religious and so I I want that and I want them to work out with me like one day a week, but I don't really want anything more than that. So I said this for two years and then this last year some dude comes up to me at my Bible study and he's like, "Are you reading your Bible?" I'm like, "Yeah." He's like, "Oh, I'm not religious, but I want to be." Cool. So I meet with him. We read the Bible together for weeks and finally he's a personal trainer. uh he becomes a Christian and then I pay him to be my personal trainer and he works out with me once a week and he's growing his business and he's similar beliefs now. It's like what the freak you have but it's like you have to put out these intentions of that type of person and I believe God brings them into your life at the right time and for different seasons and there's like different mentors for different seasons. Like I had a certain mentor while I was completely just all his stuff that's all I live by and I realized it was time to move on and no I mean I've done it I've done it with all the I mean I say I bought all the Google courses we did all the oven stuff exactly to a te all the people that followed Becker and then we're like info and I'm going to go create a SAS like everyone's tried you know that's what ovens did too and like people try to model it and it's like you know execution is a different thing but a lot of people tried to like run that gambit because they wanted to run the whole playbook not just like a piece of it a piece yeah like And sometimes you just need a piece of it that's your that fits with you. And then you grab a piece from over here and a piece from over there and it's like you architect. It's like assembly kind of like offer publishing. Speaking of offering so what's your everything comes back to where you stuck at where you stuck at like so right now it's what May 2025. So like do you guys do or you know I don't know what your team stack's like but if you're like quarterly annual like what are you trying offer publisher? I don't know. No, that's what I'm saying. Like you like what is your Okay. Okay. Well, here's the thing. When you have multiple offers in a report, like there's different pro everyone's had a different problem, which is back to going, you know, these are the problems with it. Yeah. Um I'd say for one, what are you trying to hit? What are you trying to hit? You're trying to take that one that has four monetization methods and that's going to be your golden goose. You trying to like where are you? You need operators. You need like ask you need operators. You need what? Like dude, I don't I don't know who this reaches. You have no idea. I do want I want Okay, let's put out some intent for who I want. Seriously. And someone's definitely watching this. I want a combination of a Blake. Okay, people don't know who that is. Or like, so you want a marketer? Sorry. Yes. See, dude. Blake's so cool. You need to interview him. I need a Blake. Yo, Blake, you're watching this. I need a Blake. You need a marketer? He's No, no, no. Um, well, he's a marketer, but he can stay in the weeds. You know what I'm saying? Like Oh, no. For sure can stay in the weeds. I need a I think it's 15 things, but like if I you know cuz for us you that's why I'm saying that I need a I need you. I need half you and I need half Blake. All right. I need you before the company you're in right now got really big where you found your role in just like tech and stuff like that, but you still dabbled in the other things. You know what I'm saying? Like you play multiple hats. I need someone like that right now with our current level who can be more in the weeds of some of these offers until we can replace them one role. Um, I'm more of the creative financial model builder, products, angles, messaging. When it comes to living inside of an ad account, making optimization, split tests, and changes. Don't put me there. I'll give you the ideas. You want like an integrator. You want like a marketing test run system. I want someone who can make sure our pixel's not muddy. All that freaking crap. I want to make someone our Okay, you're split testing this crap. You're doing this. you're I will do like the creative all the vision planning the products the ascension by integrator test products you can run I mean test offers not products test like cuz I'm going to tell you right now I have people in my DMs that specifically asked this who are like trying to be because again that's like kind of growth operator E and a lot of them like don't have necessarily full-on chops or experience but like they have but I don't care you can work your way up like you grit that experience that's what I mean so do you have ones that you could like if you had three of them come to you right now could you like deploy them in offers that you own and like test them and like find your person. Not three, but yeah, you one. I got one offer I can put them in and they can come in and test run it up and get because nice our deals are percentage and so I can give people like these fulfillment partners upside as well deals. So that's what you call them fulfillment partners. What's up? That you're calling them like that person to you would be like a a fulfillment partner. Yeah, they like kind of like a because I like um Yeah, they'd be a fulfillment partner. They have I'm just asking. I'm not I'm not judging. I'm asking. Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm just I want to clarify like there's some people like Craig who's running a full service agency where he's got a lot of accounts. I don't need a like I have Craig where he can handle things like that. I need someone who can be an integrator and focus on like be like you where you're on one offer and you're committed to it like you've been in yours. uh so that you can focus on that one and I could run to the next one and you know what I'm saying like yeah you need and the true thing you need is you need like a in my opinion is having that one that can go with you because that's like it's your Charlie Mer it's your it's your you know Andrew Wilkinson and his but here's the thing I don't I'm not trying to go to too many more like I'm the ne the legacy off of the four monetization maps that's like the f like that one because our products will be done for that the do you have um I have 45 we did well we did a we had a 45 4510 okay and so is it 10 the expert no that's the one dude who's scaled the offer like in the similar niche got it got so he's already has an offer doing he is already your marketing arm of that you're saying but he's more of he's not going to be like in the account yeah but again he can oversight the integrator be like Hey, correct. Correct. Well, it's like how I've been, and this is newer to me, but like we're breaking it down. Like today, I spent two hours with our bookkeeper, whatever, and rechanging our chart of accounts to make it sales, marketing, and ops more focused, not like fully, but like making it so we can have P&Ls that are specific. But that is for us how we're going to run like at scale. And again, you don't necessarily need to do that early, but like what you're talking about is like an operator, a marketer, and this in like one, which d you could have a lean like a lean team of a couple of you. The kid that uh kid the the adult male uh that was across from you at at our round table thing, he has a holding co that has a handful of people that he deploys. He has a CFO, he has like HR style, he has like all these other things. He just doesn't have the marketing arm right now or he kind of does but not like super. He wants to have someone basically is like that who like oversees it and can have you know people in those companies and see it. But like if you're doing that I mean it's essentially what it is. You just don't have a team to deploy and it's just you which is me which is me too. I literally talked to that the business coach today and I was like I have opportunities flooding to me. I want something with them but I cannot be in them. I refuse to leave this like golden goose. That's the hardest thing I had to learn like was say no. We we had someone come to us who their off last offered at 100 million. Um and they last deal they did with somebody was like a third they got 30 and they publisher got 70%. They were still coming to us like yeah we want you me and Mark to come on the deal but I was like I said no cuz I'm like I'm focusing on these other offers and like I had to say no it's just so much power in that though. So, but I knew like and it that's something I used to not and so I think yeah so that's I would say that's one thing integrator. Um another thing that I'm maturing in is financial models and understanding the best payment like structures to either pay people or for me to take in deals for it to make sense. Yeah. Um long term because there's a lot of early deals I do like that first deal where I got 30%. And they got 70. It's like at scale I'm like wait the goals I want to hit and this TAM how much I want to pay take home profit I was like I don't think I could ever get here with just that offer and I was like I would have if I would have set up the deal better. every deal you learn. What do you target nowadays? What is your if you don't mind? No, what do you target like for you for you? Because I mean, if you really think it's scale, it's going to be you and it's going to be your lean team, right? So, it's like what is right now it's just you. So, what is the number that like Tam backed out plus this and your margin you want to make percentage? Yeah. Like you you're not going to take something. You can't make more than or less than 20 grand a month or what's like what's your Oh, like take home from it. Yeah. Like if you're doing this model, you're doing it back. You're you're doing it in reverse, right? You're like, I won't do it unless I can take home like what's your number right now? Me 30 if it's not like if I can't 30ish. Okay. It's like cuz in my mind I'm like I could do one funnel build for 30. So like Yeah. Yeah. But here's the thing. There's what's tricky is some of these offers like the legacy one I'm scaling we're take we're starting with cold. We have some organic we start with but I understand that there's going to be a ramp up to that 30 and I'm going to have to be okay like in the trenches till we get there. And so that's why what's nice having these other offers that fund it because it's not as much like oh we're losing it's like so that's why I have these other offers funding this legacy offer. Uh and what do you what do you need funding for? No it's just capital like cash flow for I understand but like what do you for what? So you can pay software and ad bills. Yeah. Just so we can dump in ads and not be like, "Oh, we're los like just put it in." Boom. Boom. And I'm b testing budgets and stuff of 10 or 20 G's that you just allocate to the front end of it so you can like test because of Yeah. Usually go in a month, I'm like, "Hey, we're testing like we're willing to lose this much gambling. Hey, this is our budget. We're spending all of it." Yeah. So, every day it's like we set up like what are we willing to I don't say what am I willing to like cuz some people get caught up in making it and then they have to lose and they get mad. So, I'm like I'm going to a casino. It's like going to a casino. I'm going to my ad account. Here's our budget. We have to This is P&L. It's like having an accountant on retainer. The the we have to spend this much. We're going to spend this much. Yeah. And spend as fast as possible. Like some people, do I spend how much do I start with a day, Josh? Should I do $50 a day? 100? I'm like, okay, here. Like, okay, lifetime lifetime budget, five grand. Go. Cuz think, okay, $100 a day, 30 days in a month, $3,000, right? Like, okay. instead be like, "I'm gonna spend $3,000 on ads this month and I'm gonna do as fast as possible to get data as fast as possible and I'm gonna be okay losing that." Because you already are okay with it. You're just trying to make yourself feel safer being like, "Yeah, this much a day and then you never get true data and then you're like it didn't work. You didn't have put it in week try to spend in a week." I mean, obviously turn the ads off of there's indicators and there's all that, but I that's one thing that helped my mind. There's is there ever any team that you guys have to fund up front? Because like No. What do you do for high ticket for sales team? Yeah. Like how do you do that? Well, they just they do their commission. What do you mean? I know. But you just So like you're going to build one of these out and you want to build a high ticket on the back end. Yeah. What's the timeline of this? And then you what? Bring in a sales agency or a sales rep? Yeah. Boy, my boy Zack Rosson. Little docs him. God, you're just doxing everybody. You got to give the flowers. You got to give flowers to people who are single person's name. I don't think so. I I I said Eddie, but Eddie was on here. Yeah, but you got to give flowers, you know. You got to give flowers. Sure. Sure. Like to people who are Yeah. Actually good people. Zack Rosson, he's got his sales teams on are off. So, you get to a point where you're like, "Oh, this offer either off the get or at some point is going to need high ticket." It depends on the financial model. So, the the one the legacy one does not have high ticket involved. We're not going to have high ticket in that for the foreseeable future. Um that's part what it's data you're monetizing through volume and through like yeah tam right so subscription recurring um so we don't need buzzard two buzzard four now if I if I was going to do high ticket then I would have not I wouldn't have just taken 45% because then I got to give 20% of the high ticket to the doesn't make sense give the numbers what do you pay sales out you 20% 20%. Yeah. See, they place, they place closers, they place I don't take I don't review a single sales call. I do nothing. I send them leads. Tell you this. This either did not exist or I don't know why someone they're really quiet. It It's all the freaking dudes who sold now it's everywhere. Now it is everybody and their or I guess maybe we're just more Yeah, cuz every closer saw the model and they're like, "Oh, wait. Yeah, like that works." And they like people. Do you hear their economics? Do you know theirs? Who's the guy who makes 20 and how they it breaks out for how they make money? No. Oh, that guy you talked to at the event. Well, yeah. No, he's he's a badass, but like he gave a rough model and like we kind of talked about it. Um, and but that's an interesting business model because they'll make 20 points and it's like I look at our P&L and it's like what or what is our percentage of net new revenue that gets paid to a sales team and then also to setters and then also to a setter manager and a closer manager or a CS like the entire sales department. what is the percentage and if you mismanage that thing or like have it in whatever which way and then you add W2 and which kind of doesn't count but like you know I count it because I'm talking like true cash out right which is like% on top it's like you can get there or above there like on accident if you start stacking comp models and stacking stuff and who gets percents of what financial models are it's crazy what I mean though is like if the these guys who do 20% like that's a good deal sometimes that's a good deal sometimes if you can If you don't want to focus on it and like you just want to worry about marketing and you want to worry about fulfillment for x amount of time, you likely cannot sell with that, but no one's going to sell their business. So, I mean, yeah, like this new offer, that domain I bought and that dude, we're going right to high ticket. And I it's so it's like dude, what's up? What's the funnel type? Direct application or VSSL like just let's talk DTA. Okay. I don't I'm not an expert. Like I just do basic like what like do you do you delay? Yeah. Yeah, you got to gate it. You have a timer. When you where do you gate it? Do you gate it on like Vidalytics through there or do you gate it in time? On page time on page. Time on page or does this, you know, like elements or reveals in this many seconds? How long? Um, three, four minutes. Three, four minutes. Yeah, we just tested ours. I launched eight's really good on upsell, too. But what is eight minutes? If it's an ups if I'm doing an upsell and a low ticket funnel, then it's uh anywhere from five to eight minutes. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, we're running one right now that is uh that same one, but it's a five five minute minute delay. Okay, we're running one that's direct and not and it has right now 40% higher with the delay. 40%. Yeah, dude. Oh, you have to delay. Which is interesting because like initially we're running it and it wasn't and then we just so 40% on on just like what you when you with your delay I'm curious you you use any language like can they see the timer? Do you say your next steps it's just they're on the page just literally like running a clickbank offer where it's just like headline VSSL and then they just sit there and then like eventually it pops with the like with the CTA of you know get your bundle. I've always wondered I haven't really tested always uses language. I've always used language and a timer. So I can't really speak the other way because it's always worked well. But it is depending on the specification of the market. You have to change the wording and the verbiage of it. So how would you do a So like right now we have headline, sub headline, VSSL. We have mobile and desktop VSSL and then we have a section under that I have the entire block hidden that is Yeah. Yeah. So the timer to apply a button and then the two testimonial images. Yeah. So it' go video element then there'd be words and then timer. So it' be like words like for example your account like if it's an upsell we do basic like your login details will reveal in and then timer or your this gift will appear in this this bonus whatever your next steps will appear and then timer. So it's like word like a little column and then the timer so they see the time like okay I'll wait. Um, and so that helped, but I've never tested without. I know a lot of ClickBank offers do without. So they obviously they test way bigger volume then. Yeah. Yeah. No, they do they do numbers. Um, what would you do on a cold? What would you do on a cold though? So like you know ours, so like if it's an application, would you be like your uh you can apply in and then just I thought if your VSSL they finish the VSSL or book call, don't they get something a bonus a gift? Mhm. I just lead with I'd say is like I'd test that. Like I don't know if it it depends if it makes sense. That's an interesting idea. You already get it. You're already lucky. You already have it. So it's like Oh my I didn't even think about that. It literally says it in the beginning of the VSSL. Your bonuses. It says at the start of the VSSL, too. Oh. Yeah. It's like if you stay to the end, you get your All right, Blake, if you're watching this as your head CMO, Blake, I'm going to tell you to split. Just kidding. Watch it. Well, no, cuz they were I mean, we're running it direct and honestly, we're focused on the other ones. We just said we had two brand faces, new brand faces fly out and could do a toz full VSSLs, multiple leads, multiple whatever for a VSSL optin funnel. So, we're going to have three core that we're going to test with different faces, different ads, different whatever. We're going full dude. We're going we're going full boore. And then idea is then low ticket around each one. So, you're going to have two to three funnels around each one. Each one going deep. He's going deep. Going wide and deep within the Why would you duplicate the whole thing though, Ryan? It's a lot of work. Yeah, because No, you want here. Actually, I want to talk about this because I had this conversation with uh with Luke and he was like and he still does at some level have this vision of like oh you know nine of these right and it's like all the whatever and my whole thing has always been nine inside one which is exactly what you were kind of saying earlier which is inside one inside of main co you have nine faces they can have different angles they can have different low ticket products they can have different like entry points but they all go into the same thing. the second that I have to dupe out a HubSpot instance and have two different branded domains, two different senders, two different ever like of everything versus why I mean why versus you can do it all within one. I mean think think you know Agora think all these big boys right it's like yes they use different brand name one so like that's the that's the nth degree version of that am I not allowed to say that no no no I had you're reminding me of something a little nugget talk about depth all right so you know why I have multiple offers too like our portfolio all our offers can JV each other and promote each other that's real that's real that was Mark acting he taught me he's like every offer we sign it has to be compatible to be an affiliate. So, we're running traffic. Then we cross all offers to each other. Do you do that? Yeah. Yeah. All our offers email list to send to the other one. Yeah. You say, "Hey, so and so is doing this." You promote I have an when we went to uh Copy Accelerator event with Stephan. You say it's Stephan where Allan spoke. No, I was at the one in Scottsdale. Okay. And that's where we actually met Eddie for the first time. Um we like kind of knew of him a little bit, but we met him in person and then he hosts the best dinners and we went to that stuff and he um there was a guy there that was talking. He was like, "Oh yeah, you guys could make an extra, you know, 200 a month or whatever the number was on our on our math of how big our list size was." He was like, "How many people buy your stuff?" And it's 1% of our leads for the high ticket. Let's say all those other people. And he was like, "What would you you know, and we still are like I'm I don't know. I'm like against it." It's it is here's the thing because you like get rid of you have the potential to get rid of potential buyers like you have but one if you don't have any other offers. It's like the Hormosi thing is like his uh if if you're doing a JV if you're doing a JV deal you're doing a partnership or whatever and they're making more money than you are like you're doing the like your model's wrong kind of thing which is real. It's like, you know, and that could be postpurchase, that can be a lead, that can be a buyer, that can be, you know, a client, that can be a lead. And I don't know, I just never and he and they were like, oh, the way you risk mitigation. And I think this is great, but they're like, oh, dupe the list. Like have it go into two and then have like, you know, your Aweber, your omnisend as a separate thing, sending from the same like Yep. niche, but like a different name and then like a whole different thing and it's just monetize it on affiliate. It's like, you know, there's people who do that and then they they charge, you know, 10 or 20% of it and it's your list. You're just feeding the list, but then it's like, are they link I've heard of people that link split then to their own stuff. I've heard that people, yeah, you get pretty what are they promoting? I'm like I just don't tr I I don't know. I just don't trust them, nor do I know anyone. I It usually happens in Bisop. Great. Like what's so funny is people will sell bisop and if they can't convert like in a webinar promo cycle if you click a link or like right after the webinar is done if you don't buy they immediately start promoting a new business opportunity because you might not have resonated with the other one and they keep every and if you keep saying no until finally you buy into a business opportunity it's a I mean the model works it's just not really my but I want to be able to be like oh hey this is building an exit and like you're building a brand like you're not building a gray hat like a and guess what even they can't exit and like again like which statistics would say we have like a 01% chance or whatever if you you know I name name four people that have sold their info coaching thing properly at like a re like at a real size right like you just said your guy did that one I know like I mean I know one who did it and actually turn but like when you sell it usually I mean most of the acquisitions the deals fail but okay yeah I mean I mean like did it and he even says in his like licensing it was all the back and money. It was the grouping thing I think with supplement like he talks about it. I haven't depth into it but like you know it's hard if it's a guru centric one. Yeah. It gets a little Yeah. Well, you Oh my god. The list of things you need to do if you're running a like a normal info coaching guru business is like founder risk is like team structure. It's like making it a machine. I was a part of one that tried to exit bad of what? I was I forgot. I was a part of a company that exited and it backfired really bad on him. I was like the CMO on Yeah. the buyer and then I mean the buy the guy who sold it eventually got something legal happened because it was like there's Yeah. It was bad and I was like don't sell I'm the CMO. I'm like like it was cooked like or it was just a bad deal. Like he sold the education company to somebody who had no experience in this space. Kind of sold him a dream. And I'm like no you can't just hand off the face. The face is going to leave. I was like, "Don't, no, don't do it." And he sold it. And then it backfired because we're Oh, this guy left and the customers got mad. They all started refunding, disputing, and then this Oh, it was so bad. So, yeah, I've seen it go really bad. Yeah. I mean, I It's seen it go good, too. Yeah. There's a lot of buy, sell, biz stuff around this. That's like what are the core pillars of what you need in order to actually be able to sell one of like something in general, let alone an info coaching. It just needs Yeah. It needs to get to the level of exactly consistent future. You know that what is theood? Yeah. Cash. It's like how much of a machine is it? What are the risk pieces of it? And how do you mitigate those? Like that's everything from a traffic source to a funnel type to a face to whatever. And then on the back it's the same thing. It's like what are they buying? Is the fulfillment you know commoditized? Is it recurring? andor what is the you know what is the recurring that you know is going to happen into the future every number to a t financials booked and then the whole company running without the people that are going to leave when they sell it right it's like that's the generic version and there's 19 other things I don't know or that you know aren't on that list and damn yeah and then to get to size too like that um there's a couple guys one guy just sold one for I think five or another guy for like two and like that's cool but like if you get this thing up to scale like you can do two to five Yeah, some people are okay with that's one year. Yeah, that's less than I mean like depending on your size that's some people just but if you're just pumping an offer like it is. So yeah, you pump it which I feel like that's where I fall into. Like if I think about my thing, dude, if you're playing a cash flow game, I mean that's what a lot of these guys do and why not. But like this next one I'm building I'm like nah like I feel like this has to be with where it's going. I mean, yeah. Like knowing the TAM and the problem it solves, it'll always be here. Like I'm like, you don't, it's not gonna be a, oh, exit at a, you know, you do a million profit for three years, you exit at 3x multiple only three million. It's like, no, it's got, I feel like it's got to be more. Like the one the one dude, uh, that I was telling you about who does only low ticket. Um, like he was talking about their valuation for their company and like what they're going to exit. It's crazy. Like he opened my eyes like what's possible and they're like looking for Yeah, I won't say numbers, but it's like multiple. It's not just a $3 million exit. you know, and so I was like, "Wait, really? You could do that?" Yeah. What do you think of uh uh info plus plus physical? I have a guy that I talked to that does I mean like what's an example which again you don't have to say like the name of the company or the whatever health offers. So like what like info coaching and then supplements. Yeah. Protocols, lifestyle stuff on the front end and then supplements. What's another one? Because that's like which is great because everyone's consuming it's recurring. It's whatever. But like what's something that's like cuz I feel like a lot of the stuff you do which I like you know give you credits for is you know you said piano thing you said like in this in you know whatever like you do it outside of like MMO but like where do let's be clear I have done but never zero to one. I've never done zero to one bisop but yeah a lot of it like my it's so funny because the biggest offers that I've done are not like they're because they have beer tam outside of bisop like the piano that was what that is what our tweet exchange our tweet exchange was about was all about the oh sorry go you were breaking up I didn't hear you what marriage no yeah I was just saying like marriage hu relationship bro like I would love to publish an offer again in the marriage industry one because I believe in it I believe in marriage I believe like the problem like pain point. I'm married. Um like there's someday I' like that's the next one I feel like I'd get into. Um homeschooling that market's big. Like I because I was a homeschool I taught a homeschool class like a co-op and so I have this domain for another legacy offer I'm going to launch when I'm like 30 maybe 40. Um yeah it's it's sick. I love the name. It's the domain carries everything, bro. But yeah, these other markets like you think make money online is I thought that's where all the money is made. It's like oh it's easy to sell money at a discount. But it's getting like I don't know the people that make big bucks. Yeah. They're not. Yeah. There. And then here's the thing. The people who are doing big bucks with make money, it's gray hat. There's gray hat. White hat. Okay. Well, there's one guy um one guy who I'd say is very white hat business opportunity, but it's not make money online. It's clean bisop, which is like traditional businesses like career. So tech is a big one. want to know I I helped offer on that. That's what I that's actually that's funny you say that that was what I was going to do for a second when I was kind of like navigating and we were having conversations around this about like next steps and like what the plan was for this company and like we were going to keep it as a cash flow business for like like a year ago we all sat down and we're like that's the goal is to get this to a margin where it is sit there like we all have other interests and stuff and it was like this can only get so big like that's where our frame was at which is so silly but yeah that dude I used to think that way and I'm like seriously and like again our TAM is obviously massive but we were just kind of like that's where this sits. and that's how this lives and like we just weren't educated or like what are your thoughts like and even sorry I'm cutting you off that mindset of this is how big it can really get like let's say you even have a small smaller TAM I'm realizing why even have that mindset why not be like I'm going to get everybody in this TAM then like or when we talked to I mean when I did that call with Adam Young he the Ringba guy he literally was like they own so much market share of their TAM that all he does now, not all, but that was an over over like easy, but all they do is create content and books and whatever to grow the TAM, not get more market share of the TAM. True. He's like, we already own whatever it is, 30%, 80%, whatever number of the TAM of paper call in both sides. And they're they're essentially a connector tool, right? They're software. They are like a marketplace. There's buyers and sellers. there's companies that need leads and then there's companies and people that provide leads simply put and through paper call right and he's like the industry is only this big and it's going to be this big and I'm going to continue my market share size if not grow it but I'm going to grow the whole TAM so that I could maintain like crazy I do 50 million a week instead and I was like what and he was like yeah how would you just get to 50 million a week and it's that idea of like huh you know you have a list of 10 things you're going to do if you want to double this year and it's like if you want to 50x this here you have like one thing you can do and it's that mentality. What are your thoughts on the mentality like the people are like I feel like it's pretty limiting or what made me have that was people being like oh it's okay to have a lifestyle business and they're like they kind of make me cop out like take the way out. Um it is okay to have a lifestyle business. You know how nice it is probably to make three to five million bucks and like actually want to have a life and like go do all that stuff. But you're saying lifestyle they would cast a vision way too low. Like I'm talking the people I've been around they're like if you have make like 10k a month like 20k like but I'm like but here's the thing I think about inflation how the dollar decreasing businesses it's lifestyle okay it's goal and lifestyle there I know I know people right now that if they were making 10 or 20 online would literally drop everything would be making three times what they make in their job and could like bounce around and do minimum travel thing like that's not my interest so I I agree with you but like there are people like I could call five people I know that would literally pick that up in an instant and that would be their dream life. Yeah. I feel like the issue is like for if people watching this or even um I don't think anyone's still watching this. We're an hour and 50. No, they definitely are, bro. The consumption on like it'll be crazy. They're should I do mid roll ads every every minute and a half? No, we're they're going to transcribe it then put it into chatbt and what are the takeaways? So, AI is the takeway. I'd say if you if someone's ever hit you with a lifestyle like you can have a smaller like I would say just challenge that thought for a second because you may be built for more and you maybe could do more maybe you want that and I realized for me I bought into idea of like oh lifestyle keep it small and then there was always something in me where it's like no more you could do more you can and then I was like I had to accept that new identity because I put this one on that just didn't fit. So all I'm saying is like I think you should challenge it just like challenging going deeper like how you challenge that thought in me and I'm like yeah 100%. like dang you can go deeper. Yeah, I think I do actually I still do want to go back to the depth thing and do like a thought exercise. But the uh the my my thought around that or like my how do I say this? The for me what I've currently identified as the goal is just progression is like the one word. It is progression. That is in personal, that is in business, that is in physical, that is I love that you're not putting a dollar on it then and then you there's no dollar. It's a scoreboard. Yeah. and it's like fun and like stack it and do this, but like my how I feel. So, which is also a progression, right? Is like my my level of peace or whatever. It's like if you put, you know, there's a game to be played where it's the next thing and the next thing and there's trophies and whatever. And like I love it. Like I I still do it at some level or like set them, but I set them for the thing. It's like I could have gotten this laptop as a simplest example, you know, a very long time ago and instead I literally set it at like 25 I set it at 2500 subscribers just as like my number and then so I could get it and I love this laptop and it's great and my videos don't do this now and I did it and I'm happy because I did videos for 40 days in a row or something to get it. And it's like that's kind of fun for me is like the progression, the growth and like seeing the channel and stuff is like cool. And it's like my goal of this was three to 5k on all platforms and then just like have a network and it's like I hit that and it's like I haven't redefined what the goal is but the progression of work in the business and like my skill set stacking and the leverage and the growth and like what I feel in that the gym what I like my goal you know there's as much around progression that that exists within maintenance and maintaining something any like I don't want to say anyone but like anyone can hit a goal you know how hard it is to like stay. It's like anyone can get ripped once, right? It's like stay there and exist ripped. And it's like there's these different examples of that that I've kind of is what I'm trying to define it as. And this is also me saying that I was the guy who like like I you know I don't have the personal thing at all figured out. I don't have so much figured out. And it's just like what I'm focused on right now is what I'm trying to easily say is just like just progress. Just get like better. Just the 1% that unlocks something for me. I that that that word I like that I know and it's just simple and it's just real because it's not uh the business a certain size it's not a certain fitness thing it's not a whatever it's like these grouping of goals that are simple that are one to three things a quarter in each domain like in you know in your personal in your business in your partner or like relationships friends family partner your whatever and just like kind of set some um and again I'll be the first to say like if I'm not good at this like there are times where I'm very bad at this and I can't do it or I or I fail at Not that I can't do it, but yeah. I don't know. Just stuff around that for me. But I will say the I don't even know how I got on this, but the other thing that I was talking about this morning with the or the biz coach brought up to me was like having the day of the week or the day of the month or something where you zoom out and like re like relook at your plan like pull out of it. Oh yeah. Be introspective. Yeah. zoom out and be like, "All right, so you're a machine 12 hours or 18 hours a day doing all these things that you set an intention of a month ago or a week ago or whatever and like do you still want to operate in this? Is this still serving those progression goals? Are you actually progressing or do you need to change the strategy?" And like I need to do that with this. I'm on day 67 or eight in a row of this and like I'm just living within I'm a cog within the machine that I created. And it's like do I want to zoom out and change my approach? And that's kind of what I'm doing with these videos, these like conversational ones instead of me just spewing like, you know, more or less updates. Like there's so much value in the beginning and there still is, but it's like a different type where I can only, you know, I can go deep dive in these buckets, but yeah. So blah blah blah. I like I think that's important. Progression. Progression. I like that. No, I'm holding on to that. That's good. Like if I get one thing from this like that I'm taking, that's my thing cuz I I need that one. Mine is your bonuses unlock in five minutes. Mine's very tactical. I hope it works. I was going to say you doing that we could crack like numbers. Am I doing that? I don't know. I said just that one thing. That's that's I try and say that all the time. I'm like for the six six figure a month the seven figure a month guys. There is literally one thing you pick up in something I said or I hear from somebody that is like oh and that adds one or three or five or 10% to one of your KPIs in the middle and that can be millions a month. True. Whereas like if you're just starting up it's like it doesn't matter. No, anything works. GHL works, Click Funnels works, this works, that works. A low ticket works. Like like everything works, dude. Let's talk W. Go ahead. I love W. Yeah, they're cool guys. Well, here's the thing. I just like being wind and dine. Let's be real. I like when the credit card companies wind me. Travel company. I told I told Hunter that today. I said he's like, "How are you liking the product?" I'm like, "Bro, this product could suck, but if you keep I don't give a crap. I'm going to run." They're good dudes. They're good dudes. We still haven't moved any of our stuff over. We're talking about using Split. We're talking about using split it, but the biggest thing is split it. Let's talk gamecher numbers for people. All right, let's talk six figure, seven figure people. You want to make some more money? I would do that. I would do that if I wasn't in our current setup. Split it and um the refund the customers are a lot better. I found actually because what happens you split it? Split it. Yeah. The people who use split it, you're saying the customers are better. Yeah. Here's why. Let's say you have a customer. Let's just do mid ticket. All right. So, mid ticket, $1,000 offer, $997, classic webinar offer. What back in the day, what we'd have to do is you would offer two time payments of 597 or like three time payments of 397 or four of whatever, right? Bro, if you look at who's refunding before the like in that 30-day window where you're offering it, who's cancelling? Bro, it's all those people because that if they didn't have $1,000, 200 is still pushing it for them. But now with a $1,000 offer, you they can pay $83 a month with no fees, interest on their end, and they will stay past that 30-day window more. They're not as like, I want out, and then they'll give it more time. So for you, your refunds will go down. The customers I found, they respect the product more. They're not this anxious person who is like, I have this much time to make this much money back or to get this result, lose this much weight, find my girlfriend. So um do you price in the fees? Um, obviously I I have other ways to get fees. Um, but I do know people that do price and fees. Um, I think that's gray area with financing. I know people who do both, but like I don't know if you're sometimes like, but you could justify. I mean, think about it. If you do a payment plan, normally they you'd say, "Hey, if you don't do painful, you're going to pay more of our time." So, I don't think it's that big of a problem. Yeah. Yeah. No, I It's I would do it. It's like for me right now how the the flow of our data, the flow of our pay size, we would have to like do so many different things, different order forms or we have to move everything. And if I moved everything, it's like now subscription management lives in there and like all this stuff and like I I love those guys. I love the product. I think it it's great. Like I would never have our customer base in the pro like actually in there like our we would never put our community or our products in there just because of how the vibe and the look and it's kind of more young money like onlineyum which is amazing. Again it's great. It's just like not really our demo style. But I love their options. I love what they're doing. I think it makes a ton of sense. And like if I was to offer something or like I would in two seconds sign up and use that. Yeah. Um I almost bought something the other day. I think we actually we're looking at something right now that's like, you know, 30 grand and I and they have a split option on there and I'm like, "Okay, cool." Like, "Why wouldn't we for agencies now?" I was telling my agency friends, it's only onetime pay, obviously, though. What do you mean? They're one-time payments that you can split it. They're not You can't rec Okay. Yeah. Where you going with this? Oh, no. I was just telling like my agency buddies, they like lose a lot of clients and their cash flow is a big issue because, you know, return and whatever. and signing a year contract. It's tricky because it might just cancel anyways. And so I was like, "Bro, why aren't you just using like split it and get them like a long How is this not going to backfire? It's going to Well, how is this not going to backfire? It's like you're like churn does not exist because of the payment method they use. Churn does not exist because of the payment meth. What do you mean? If those people were going to turn on you, they're gonna churn on like there is a still a percentage that is going to churn and there is going to be default risk on the other end of that that is like not your problem. I understand but like but it's somebody that's why I'm saying you that's where the offer owners people watching this you have to just like you use CLA like you have to be okay with offering someone Clar or Afterpay knowing that they're going to maybe miss their payment or credit card fees like what are you what's the responsibility you're willing to take and make one is if you're going to get kicked off platform because you have too high of one which is real and that's with you have a direct relationship with any of them and I don't know how the risk mitigation occurs across the entire you you know, it's going to get I mean, at some point I feel like it gets No, those guys crushed and like clearly they have done it and they've done it with high-risisk stuff across, you know, white label on multiple things and like they have done their job with it. So, I'm not saying I'm not saying them specifically, but you look at some of these other finance partners and like I had one that a lot of I a lot of coaching companies use and I have done many a demo and vendor research on this and had math models broken out and they will go, "Okay, cool. Your customer is going to pay, you know, 18% basically, but it's baked in. It's this flat number. Everyone gets it. you're going to pay X percent or what hits your bank account. And then we also have on the back end, you know, a 3% collection thing. If it gets over this threshold, we start to pull from the funds from future this or out of a bank. I'm like, I want to own your business. I'm like, you make money here, you make money here, and you never lose money. Take someone to collections, which is like that's when it happens is we have to like someone ramps an offer, sells $3 million worth of stuff, and then ghosts and like we have to collect. So like they have risk but like in their their actual model they're just churning. Yeah. Those guys take money too as like you know you because they need Is it kind of like credit card companies where they kind of want you to miss your payment? Well yeah because they want the Yeah. I mean they want the it's kind of like I could never you have to have the you have to have the bank for that. The literal bank for that in order to finance it because you you Okay. Have you heard of private credit? How big that is? Yes. Yeah. So it's like I do anything in that world at all and I think it's that you want to talk about someone with an LTV to CAC ratio is anything that have that on the back end anything that has money management anything that has like financial instruments in terms of insurance private lending uh um through some of the different financing partner like there are guys that have you know multiples of these because they did did it through financing. There was a guy at that dinner which I that was actually we talked after that dinner but there was a guy at the dinner that we were with that knew how much people get based on XYZ criteria. They run it through the application and they get like 90% of the people up to a 26 they they price their product based on how much the loan approvals are for that exact criteria with a with a partner they have. So they'll just rack 26 and then they know on the back cell they have somebody else that'll take the same loan and add 15 G's to it and like play this game. And like again, shout out to them and they have people who have great success and I'm sure they have a lot of people who don't, but like that's not my game. Yeah, that's how I mean that's how a lot of these guys do size. I mean it can justify especially if you have ROI justification if you're selling something that someone can make like an ROI but like ROI and like we don't we I mean I've I've never sold something that has ROI justification although like it's transformation it's it's you know it's you know without guarantees without anything guarantees bro. Okay. All right. All right. Want to share a little gray a little gray gray hat? Okay, this might be No, I was going to say I got I got nothing for you. So, go ahead. Shoot. All right, people. Actually, I don't know if this you got Okay, tell me if this is bad or not. People are watching this at 2 hours and 1 minute in. Yes, there's die hard. Hey, shout. If you're watching at two hours, comment below. And you can't do comment. Comment two. Two. Let's see how many real ones are. And yeah, maybe we'll give you something. We'll give I don't want this to become a podcast. Is this considered a podcast? No, podcasts. Podcasts are different top Well, shoot. We did hit a bunch of topics. There's not se interview and like whatever. And it's like I almost I posted that one of Eddie the other day and then I almost posted the meme right after and it's like guys just need therapy but instead they start a podcast or whatever and I was like damn like that hits like it just and I don't that's not the intent of this. The intent is to build a audience of six and seven people. It's I mean my whole why I interview people is like to find the operators behind the scenes. Like that's like why I started I was like who's behind the people and like I wanted to I'm not an operator so I need to hang out with people like you because then it so like yeah we like for me I'm like selfishly but I also want to highlight the people who don't get highlighted a lot anyways. Yeah, that's fair. But yeah, it's not a podcast. Not a podcast. No. Okay. Tell me if this is this is gray or not. I heard this from a lady. She's made a lot of money selling courses and her whole thing is creating courses that people consume and finish and get results from. So, I love that. Like she does it from a good heart, but what people say, this is like a non it's like a compliant way to talk about outcomes, but instead of saying guarantee, you say goals. So, you say the goal of this program is make $10,000 a month. Like the goal at the end of the program, the goal is you hit this. If now we're not promising you're going to hit this goal, but we've set up the product in a way so that we can get you to that goal as fast as possible. And like you So you're you because it's a goal. It's like oh you hit the goal. So yeah. Yeah. So you're asking if that's gray. Do you think that's gray? So there's white or black. That's white. And you can't guarantee that they're gonna hit the gold, but you say, "Hey, the go." So is Yeah. So it can tell you this. I know that people have had sales recordings uh looked at by, you know, government agencies that have looked at it. And if you use the sales classic style, the here's your current state here. What's your dream state? And bridge them to that because you're saying, "Okay, I make Yeah, I make zero." And they're like, "What's your goal?" And my goal is to make 25. And you're like, "I'm the one that gets you to the 25." and saying that you are gonna get them to that is like an implied a shoot. So, it's not compliant then. Yeah. Supposedly, and again, this is I don't I don't know. We've never had to deal with stuff like this. We don't use guarantees like that. We don't use anything that's like that. We don't use, you know, time frame like anything. So, um but I have definitely heard that that that if framed the wrong way can be used like that. That's what I feel like could be I don't know. I feel like that's not terrible. It's like what our target is and like this is not you know typical results which is Yeah, true. You probably have to have crazy decision. Very hard. How are you going to say that in the same sentence? You're like, "Oh, yeah. Our goal is, you know, we get everyone to 10K." And it's like, "But it's not typical." Like, how are you going to say that? Well, no, you don't say we the goal like I feel like the pitch would be like, so you'd reframe it. So people like, is there a guarantee? Like if you're in a webinar, for example, I'd be like, now I see a lot of questions people ask me, is there a guarantee? How much can I make from it? It's like, well, legally, I cannot or what you can say is this, like I have specific numbers in my head that I know are realistically possible for people to hit that I've seen people hit. I have in my head. can see those numbers, but legally I cannot say that because it'd be misleading. And you guys all know the people who are scammy who have told you stuff before. And so I'm not going to tell you that. But what I can say is we have a goal. We set goals just like how you know you're trying to lose weight. You set a goal for how much you're trying to lose blah blah blah blah. Like there's a goal to win the game. You know, you want to score a touchdown. Like these are the touchdowns in our program. Number one is to get you your first 1K a month. The second goal is D. And so you'd reframe it that way maybe. I don't know. And then you say now these results are not typical. I don't know enough about this because exactly because I know that when you do results a lot of times I'm just saying you personally your personal morals gray, white or black. That's pretty white. Okay. I don't think that's that bad. I mean depend again it really comes down to the language. So I don't know. I mean that's Yeah. Yeah. I mean and the lady made her justification. Go ahead. She said that her consumption went up so high in her courses because throughout the whole program it's like here's the goal like step hey guys it's like great. So I think it's good for the customer and then people actually got the goal because whereas most people now they don't actually engineer their courses to get results. So it's that's honestly more great. Exactly. And that's a huge thing you want to talk about we had a whole conversation about that today around how because we just launched our that retention program today that backend program you did it and yeah but then the idea being you know everything's a funnel. The framing of how they're getting on the call to renew is not ideal because of how the the fulfillment is of the initial year because we've basically been servicing a contract not framing it for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, continued access, all that stuff like that hasn't existed. So because of that, yes, we get the result, yes, we fill in the contract, yes, it's amazing and we have all that stuff happen, but they're not in an activation way built that year one is your this, year two is where you, you know, what's a good one? You know, year one is where you build, year two is when you multiply, year three is when you, you know, exponential like and but only talking about year one and servicing on year one makes it so your year two is like not good. like you don't like people don't know what's coming next. They don't have something out there. They don't have a road map. They don't complete the first year and get a medal shipped to them in the mail that's like you're you know you completed this and now you're in your multiply phase and like that stuff is real. Yeah. When it comes to LTV and it comes to that kind of stuff, right? True. So if you can do both, if you can make the model so that your backend has higher margin, which it already out of the gate will because you won't have acquisition and sales, you might have retention, but if you can make it so the fulfillment is also low because it's like a one to many, it's your software, it's your whatever and it is truly like sticky in like a in a good good way as in like people get pissed because their subscription cancels like you know their payment fails, they get pissed or because whatever like that is what I am starting to lean lean towards over the last 30 60 days of understanding that is something that we've never focused on. It's total leaky bucket, right? It's like we're making we're making money more or less on the front end, not as much on the back end like at all. And we flip that on and like your entire economics two, three, 10x. Yeah. Yeah. Like hard. And that's what's exitable, you know? It builds the enterprise like all all of that. Not just one part of it, but the whole whole machine. So that's fire. What else you got? Or should we wrap? I've always got stuff, bro. I'm sure you do. You always chilling. All I know is it's 9:22 p.m. here and I Are you Where do you live? Don't worry about it. What does your daily routine look like? Ryan Clark, day in the life. Ryan, would you ever do a vlog, dude? You got to do vlogs next. That would go viral, bro. Because you're so mystical. Like, I literally think like, what does he do during the day? Like, does he just take Zins and nicotine and work? like why is he so he's like I just had a cup of coffee. Um like what's your daily routine right now in this mode when I was cranking when I was doing these initially it was up at you know 5 and then if I wake up before that I have to stay up because if not I fall asleep and it's like 7 or 8 and then I hate my life for the entire day and I think I ruined it. So it's like just get up when you get up and stay up and then I just hit the desk and then in the morning it's like that's the only time that people aren't on Slack and like messaging. So it's like my deep work zone is then. So it's like deeper work early in the morning if I want to build something project tech like all that I do in the morning. I build management list ops stuff. I go through chat like all that stuff. Then I used to then also do my video right off the rip. That was the best because I could build the technical stuff and when I was doing all like the funnel maps and the percents and all that, I would do it then and then I would either film it then or then it runs into time when people start like waking up and being in communication channels. So then I talk on that and now it's like it's a mix. I do like stuff like this and then I also do stuff that's in the main co and do that. middle of the day, go to the gym, come back to this, do more of this, and then this is a lot of time when I have like meetings or conversations or stuff is after that. And then I eat somewhere in between there and then I'm done at 9 or 10 and then I do it again six, seven days a week. Crazy. Um, people have got some questions on Twitter. I got Let me pull them up here. What someone asked some questions under your post? um would love more specifics about one the exact tool stack behind using those live pre-recorded Zoom webinars. Um a event shoot I have a call with him tomorrow. Good dude. Last Thursday after you recommended him and he was Did you get a I need to tell him hey uh give me an affiliate uh number number two. How to specifically segment leads based on financial qualification to send them to different webinars. Hero pixel. Yeah, he uses the hero pixel. I don't actually use anything, but I know Douglas at LeadFi and it's pretty pretty good. I know a lot of guys who use it actually. Like the other guy that I know that does 30 something million uses them. One of the guys who does 2 million a month uses them. Dang. I know uh fan base uses Hero Pixel. Um yeah, good. They're all same data enrichment, but that's my home team. Uh I want to test one webinar for people who have spent less than $1,000. Okay, whatever. He that was not a question. There's your answer. a event lead fi hero pixel enrich those data um and that's all she wrote that's all she wrote all right how do you want to rap what's the next goal laptop you got the laptop what's the next goal for the social for me I don't know I wrote 10 I wrote 10 on this 10 something 10,000 subs easy let's get 10k 10k subs I'm just chilling so yeah I just want to have really cool people on here. I need to do a better job. I think I'm going to hire assistant. I've never had an assistant. I think I'm going to have one that's like a VA style, not like full-blown, but just that can help me like schedule these and structure this stuff out because I have a lot of really good people and I want to make sure that I have information prior to them just so I have like enough context because I kind of know who a lot of them are, but like I don't have enough. Like I obviously know you, I know Eddie, I know I kind I didn't really know Adam actually, but um I don't know. It's just like I want these to flow and be like fun and cool and not be like interviews or like the every other one. And I just want to like catch up with cool people. And then I want to get like, you know, more referrals, other cool people and just like catch a vibe. But I also at some level do want to like get Eman status where I just show up and I just do it and then it's I I'm done. Like right now it's like the before, it's the after, it's the schedule, it's the I have to export this, I have to do all that stuff and like Oh yeah, like you want to outsour but that's pretty easy. I just want to well kind of like all of that and I just haven't done that right now. I do everything. It's one zap, bro. Like one NAM. It's one zap, bro. It literally zooms on you puts your Google folder, your Google folder transcribes it or Phantom Chat transcribes it, crumbs up the thumb, the hook, you prompt the thumbnail, the title, then sends to theuler. Like it's pretty been around for a while. So one zap could do it. All right. Well, I don't even have that set up. So, if someone wants to set that up for me, I'm more than Damian. Hit Damian hit you up. You got all the plugs. You got all the plugs. All right. Well, people know where to find you. X is your main. Oh, dude. X hit 600 uh followers today. We out here. We out here. Feeling like Feeling like a young gun on this money Twitter. Money Twitter. I feel like an old soul with my wife and stuff. I'm like, "Hey, young souls trying to be cool on X. You're savage." All right. All right, brother. You're amazing. Two hours, 10 minutes. Longest one I've ever done. I think we covered a lot of goodies in there. I will drop this uh tonight because I have to get this out. So, people are ready. People are ready. People are ready. They're texting. Is it done yet? Appreciate you. Talk soon.

# made $683,382 this week... here’s EXACTLY how | EP67
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQQhB8jdeY

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing raw exact strategies on how we did $683,382 in the last 7 days. Comes out to around $97,000 a day on average. I'm going to walk through the marketing, sales, and fulfillment systems that we use right now to achieve this. And if you stick around to the end, I'm going to talk about how we are planning to 3.1x this to get to 10 million a month. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in this business. We've now done over 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No guru, no course, no mastermind, nothing. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing as you will see in this video. All with the goal of finding top talent to join the team opportunities and network with cool people building cool So, let's get into it. All right, so May 11 to today, I I took the screenshot right before this. It's 35 after right now. Let's get into the funnels. So, this is the web of all of the funnels. I'm going to go one by one first of what we're running in marketing and then we're going to talk about how they all connect. So, to start, we have a VSSL opt-in funnel. This is our core funnel. This is exactly what we used to do 70 million of that cash collected before we started to pivot and do more. I think we should have broke earlier, but we did not. So, if you've been on the channel before, today's day 70 or 66 of me doing this in a row. And you can see kind of more deep dive some of the past stuff and the evolution. But to start, we have an opt-in page. We're going to have name and email. We do not collect phone number because we do not use it well enough. Okay? So, we just have name and email on the ops. We are then going to go to a VSSL page that will have the VSSL, nothing else on the page. wait until the CTA in the video to do the popup for the apply button. They will go to a dedicated application page where they will apply. This same application page is the one that's going to be used across a lot of these and it what is the main CTA on any of the social assets on the site anywhere. They come direct through application. They will then land on a booking page where they can book. They will then go to a success page that is flooded with testimonials, pre-objection block, what you should know before your call. They get on the phone with the closer and then they join the uh program, become a client. Okay, so that's the VSSL opt-in funnel. Now, what we're doing here is we were testing multiple opt-in pages running through the same VSSL and then all around the same messaging and then we were also testing two different VSSLs that were on the same messaging. Ended up not flopping necessarily, but the control one. So, we had these running. Now, why I kept this here is because we're running two tests right now and seeing what happens. But essentially, the main VSSL funnel that's running has we're testing another messaging style of uh VSSL. So basically, you know, imagine you're talking about this messaging pocket, then this match messaging pocket. Two different ones. What we're starting to see is because the alignment's not there on the messaging that's on the opt-in page to the VSSL, it is not converting. So, we have that off. Now, what we or we don't have it off yet, but we're letting it run. The big one that we're doing is we're running a completely second standalone VSSL funnel. So, this is like one to one. So, paid to ad direct to a different opt-in page to a different VSSL through the same application. So, there's where they connect back. And this one is crushing for us. So, we ran this one on call it, you know, whatever. We're just going to call it pocket one of messaging and pocket two. Still selling the same program, but bring them in through something different. Think like thyroid versus general fat loss or think like, you know, I mean, stuff like that, like different messaging pocket is what I mean. This one is crushing for us. We have not scaled into it heavily and this one still tried and true works at, you know, call it five figures a day in ad budget. Okay, so this is funnel number one. This is a majorityish at this point of the heavy lifting. Now, funnel number two is a DTA, which is what we're calling it, which is a direct application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL. So, you can watch other videos where we tested this. We essentially had three of them going, same headline, different VSSL, same application, three running all through one link as a split. We use VWO for that. I have other videos where we talk about that on the tracking. They will then apply direct there. Okay, that goes the application comes up in a pop-up. Once they fill it out, they then go over to the booking page. And then from the booking page to success, same flow as this. Okay. Now, the big difference here, and I just did a video with Eddie Malof on this and talked about this, but for us, we were testing this with the button on the page immediately visible. So, someone did not have to consume anything. Now, this will have way lower consumption, right? Because it has less friction or guess the other way around. It has less consumption and less friction. Um, and because of that, this one is getting extremely cost effective apps and bookings. And even on like uh just data metric you just look quick on like or basically contextually or the content of the applications they are high quality but they are not showing as well and they're not closing as well because they don't have as much friction. Okay. So we're doing what we can to try and grow that but in current state that is not backing out amazing for us. It's doing okay and it's definitely profitable but it's not like as scalable into it. Now we optimize around purchase instead of around schedule. A lot of people optimize for schedule. We have not been able to do that because of just some of the different things we've broken on the pixel which we're working on right now. Okay. Now, the big test here that we are doing is we just launched this as a split. That's why I put it here. So, two-way split where this one is actually waiting to show the CTA page or the CTA button to apply until 5 minutes in. The actual VSSL CTA is the same one that's running up here. For example, this is a 25m minute VSSL and 20 minutes in or whatever it does the CTA. That's when this button pops. This one it's always on and this one we're only waiting five minutes based on the idea that if someone opts in you can email market to them back here. That's why we didn't do one. But we need a little bit more friction to try and see if we can basically just gently increase the consumption, gently increase the cost but vastly increase the backend return. Okay, so hopefully that makes sense. Now low ticket we are doing a low ticket ascension funnel not AOV or like front-end profitability focused. I mean that is the goal at some level is to you know get it either making money or as close to as possible. Our target is 50% SLO. Um so I think it's SLO SL selfquidating. Um so we are running three of these. Again one of the big things we found out about this so quick through the funnel. They land on a sales page that is long form. It'll have two it'll basically say start checkout. They'll start with their name and email and click like continue. It'll bring them to a two-step. So here so you capture that information. You have ops that then you can then re uh retarget to who don't complete checkout. Basically can abandon and cart. They'll come here on this checkout page. These technically we're running three different that are completely three different designs. So the checkout pages are in alignment with the design. They will then go to once they purchase they'll go to a booking page. When they book it is framed as a starter call uh you know quick start something like that. And is actually booked with a setter. Okay. So they'll book with a setter. Then they will go over here and book with a closer. the setter will push them to set with a closer or they will set it with the closer and then they will purchase. Okay, now backing up on this for us this being ascension focused it is built for the setter call and for the closer call to get them into the high ticket. It is not trying to liquidate them. It does not have upsell one two three trying to get an a higher AOV. The only leverage we have is within here to get order bumps on this. Now I'm going to talk through these all in one and we're going to talk about what we changed and what's working now for us to achieve this. So these funnels all three run independently with traffic but they over they they are in connection okay because someone will see this then they'll come over here then they'll buy low ticket they'll get set through here so technically they initialized here but then their last click was within this they'll end up talking to a setter closer okay in here they'll route through it like all of the things you can imagine. So the big things that we're changing for the VSSL side of things for this opt-in funnel is this secondary messaging is huge. So we're leaning into that. So we have three main core pockets around messaging. We're going to test three different ones and we are also testing three different brand faces which introduces another variable but we are confident in it because they are working on the ad side towards this one that is another brand face. So imagine you have a video of me in an ad. Then you land on there and some and you know some other guy is talking and is then doing the training. there's a bit of uh it doesn't pass the continuity test. Okay. So, we are in pretty we're pretty certain that it's going to work. So, we're going to test three different ones of those, but right now we're testing one that's just different messaging with the original brand face. Okay. So, that's through and through there and it's working. We are constantly doing different splits on the designs of these two pages. And just so I can go a little deeper, the these pages technically split out because there's a router inside the application for all three of these applications that um will send them based on the quality of their application responses and their financial qualifiers and stuff to a DQ version of this that either gets picked up by setters or the kind of like ramping lower reps. Okay, now that is the main core changes we're launching here. I think that it's going to work for us. I think that uh you know, we ran this initial VSSL funnel too hard. Um, so we're booking x amount per day. And the cost per call has come down pretty significantly since we got our CMO in. So the real answer to all this is like what's working now for marketing, sales, fulfillment, ops is people. That's like the the simple answer for this. But I'm trying to give you some t uh tactical stuff on what the people are implementing. And again, this is our team doing this and with us, not not me in there clicking the buttons or having the conversations. Okay, so that's what's running there. DTA, I just talked about what our plan is. So we are testing one right now that's a five minute. We may have to delay to three. We may have to put a timer on page that shows it's going to pop in three to five minutes. Something along those lines. Or we just need to be able to cook the pixel well enough that add enough friction inside the application that they have on page that it actually makes sense for them or that it actually uh qualifies them enough to make it through to the next page. Okay. So dancing around back and forth. The harder option is complete other VSSL. That's qualifies them more. But the issue is they may not ever actually completely watch the VSSL even if you don't have the delay. They can't necessarily you can't confirm that they're watching the VSSL. Okay, so that's the gist there. And then low ticket. This has been a very interesting journey for us. So for us, we because we have millions of contacts and millions of people in the system and have been running this for years. When we launched this, we already knew that some of the leads or some of the buyers more so were coming from existing people in the CRM, whether that's four years old or three days old. Um, but as we continued to lean into it, it looked as if more of like 70% of the traffic was coming through warm leads. So, or 70% of the purchasers were coming through warm leads, which makes it more of a retargeting asset than a cold scalable low ticket product. Okay. So, stats on this are phenomenal. Um, well, more so the stats on this on how they back out on the all that. Uh what we're struggling with is getting the net CPA and actually having it be new not as a retargeting only because to truly scale this to hundreds and thousands or whatever of units a day we need to make sure that it is cold friendly. Okay. So we basically built out two different variations that are same product just different framing that makes it a little bit more cold friendly and same with the page design and it is working well. So we're testing things on uh Facebook or on meta side of things to do that as well as there. Okay. Now, all of this is more so how did we get people to the system or into the system and how did we get people onto the calendars and the phones, but this is more so how did we actually like collect the cash, right? So, now we're going to get into sales and fulfillment. So, I said we brought on a new cso, same team, same everything. and he came in and layered in energy, structure, focus on numbers, new scripting, new standardization, all these things, and just brought life back into the existing team that's already there. And just like that, we had a pretty stark uptick. I can do an entire video on this, but just that alone, which is interesting because we had a few different sales managers that we were interviewing for for that role that all of them had said like, "Oh, these are the standard KPIs that we'll run by or like the bare minimum." And all of them were light years ahead of what ours were, which was very interesting. It wasn't just from one person. We did get the best of the best that we wanted and we're very happy about that. But it was very interesting that it came from across the board and from people I talked to in the industry that had that. So he raised the bar and the standard with the same team. So now begins training, development, structure, uh, standardization around our like all the things in that. And that is going to be an even bigger boost to this essentially is my plan or is what is what we're thinking. So sales is crushing it right now and they're only going to crush it more. This was only their first week in it which is great to see. So fulfillment side of things developing here is essentially different programs that we're rolling out of the back end. It technically has not been it's not reflective of this because this start this rolls out tomorrow what I'm about to talk about. Um but we are rolling out things like we're basically rolling out two different options for retention. We have never focused strong on LTV which would be included in this gross volume not the new volume. Um but a majority of this came from new. Okay. So, where fulfillment is crushing is we are getting plenty and plenty a day of client results, client wins that then feed back into the marketing and sales system that we can use to help uh leads become buyers because they are seeing that we get them results. Okay. But we are not doing an effective job of and what we need to change that I think will just explode this is the framing during year one to stay into year two. And we have never had conversations about that. We've never put it into the programming into the planning into how the product is structured. You all know the product that on month nine or 11 or whatever before your thing's up they start to frame you and talk about what's going to happen in the next year and how amazing it is. We do not do that because we have never really offered that in a clean way. So just changing that is what we're rolling out to start and changing that and also offerings of different things. So basically multiple more years on the back end that you can purchase up front. So think something that's higher ticket. Think something that is lower ticket that is continuity because that's going to be a majority of current state people who want to stick around paid their high ticket thing once but they want to stay for community access um all the things in that way just not the onetoone personalization as much but maybe like a group or a many to one uh version. So for that uh I think that's going to be a huge thing. It's also going to help the enterprise value when we can have a long-term recurring thing. uh if you follow me on X, I'm like I'm studying all these like customer uh retention and community management all these stuff books because I want to get ahead of it. So we're launching those on the tail and then operations we just have an amazing CMO, we have an amazing cso now. We have an amazing chief product and these divisions are like ready and powerhouses. So now they're all working together. Initially I always say like what's your bottleneck? We thought it was marketing because where the lead flow was uh was not ideal and also the cost like just kind of the whole situation and sales was not backing out the leads. So we're like this is a marketing issue and granted it was at some level and we brought in a CMO restructured everything built it for scale was amazed at how we were even doing it how we were. We were only running one funnel. We were set up very messy inside of our ad accounts and he completely restructured that setup and is now set up for scale sales. I'm sorry. Once we solve for that, it still weren't backing out into sales, and we're like, "Okay, wait a minute. This is a two-prong problem here, which then is going to solve for sales." We had a sales manager that got us from 1 million to 3 million, helped us like crush in that way, and then uh over the x amount of time has been interested in becoming an entrepreneur, and we helped him go and do that, and he phased out clean and we brought in the new one that I found through my network on YouTube and X, and uh brought him in, and he's just going to be a powerhouse. Like, he just he crushes. So after solving for that just that is what got this lift right here. So having all the marketing restructured so that we could consistently fill calendars with quality and then having sales layer in is there and then fulfillment is the next batch of what we're doing. They're already crushing it in terms of results but now we just need to do it in a way that boosts LTV more not just gets the one-time result. Okay. Operations like I said is all of them in one. Now what are we doing to get to 300K a day? So those back-end ones and just more volume very very simply put that's exactly the plan. So we in the marketing front let's go one by one. In the marketing front the goal would be to have essentially three of these maybe or three of these andor these and then three of these. Right? So you're going to have imagine person one that talks about messaging one and they're going to have three different styles of funnels or two two to three. You're gonna have one that's VSSL focused. You're going to have one that's low ticket that's actually a purchase that's uh based on ascension. You're then going to have uh another person with another messaging pocket here and here all under one brand name. You reduce founder risk, you reduce market saturation, like all these different things all under one brand name. So that is going to be a huge lift. And then we're going to go one by one so we don't overdo it. Uh one other thing I forgot to mention in this in sales is setters. We scaled to 24 setters. We had zero setters uh up to 71 million. We had never done setters ever. um not effectively. We kind of tried it once but not really. Um they are in every pocket of this. Someone who applies but doesn't book and falls off. Um somebody who books and doesn't show. Somebody who submits a form or custom time request because it doesn't the times on the calendar don't work for them. Um this one they are huge. They're major major leverage and they actually have the highest show rates and close rates through this system with low ticket ascension. They'll get auto booked in with for a 15-minute zoom. They will talk to the person, you know, make sure they have all their stuff and then frame them to why did you not, you know, try and book the or why did you not try and apply for our onetoone coaching? It has better results. It has all this kind of stuff. They do an amazing job framing here. So, there's going to be a huge evolution with that team because it's they're mainly doing inbound hot leads and we have, you know, a million and some change leads right now in the system. High hundreds of thousands uh in the system that have phone number and then the rest are email. So, they're going to be able to work the people in the pipeline. We have Facebook groups. We have inbound phone number stuff we can add. We have all the things. So that's just more like volume. Um but for us right now it's going to be for the marketing front. It's going to be pushing these further because they can go so much further and then also layering in the other ones at the same time. Marketing team is growing to have more structure in that way. Sales is going to grow is is going to kind of do two things. It's going to like tighten up. So the current team is going to get I'm sure a little bit tighter and they're going to have more expectations standards and more performance. We are then going to grow the team directly through external hires that we are then going to be able to scale into through that. There's going to be a lot of stuff that changes for them. Our expectations, things around that. Uh as well as close baseline percentages that did not exist prior. Uh in alignment with that, the comp will get better for that. Comp will get better for that and comp will get better for that. I'm setting that up right now so that margin stays locked as we scale in which was not what happened when we went from 12 to 30. Um and that's there. And then fulfillment is the behemoth. That's basically what we are going to be focusing on what my main focus is going to be on as we begin to lean into this because everyone every person that churns through here or is not fulfilled on in the way that frames them for the second year is just leaky bucket and lost LTV. So that's the next focus is what we can do with other offerings on the back. We are talking about offering something else on the front end that's a bit um higher ticket potentially. Um, we do have people who ask for it already, so it could fit, but again, that's just more of a fulfillment headache when we're rolling this out. So, right now, I just want to focus on the core offering, making sure it's dialed for that, and then making sure that the backend, too, are built out and structured in a good way with the right retention team, which is kind of a sales function. So, hope that makes sense. I think just pushing that'll get us to 10. And then I want to talk about some crazy  But until then, this is what we're going to do. This is where we're cranking at 19 minutes. What's working now for us? I hope that was indepth enough. Been talking a little headier stuff and yeah, find your bottleneck. So in here, if you go to rinccclugg.com, www.ryclog.com/docck, I have all the videos I've done. I'm on day 60, whatever, seven in a row of doing these. And you can sort them by here by tech, marketing, sales, ops, mindset, or just watch them in order. I mean, this is just me talking through random things, but they all do connect. And it's been a journey. I have days in here where we're losing 30 grand trying to figure out what's going wrong. And now we are doing, you know, 100ish a day, which is good, but not even close to where we're going. So, hopefully this was helpful. Appreciate you guys. Drop some comments. Let me know some feedback, what you'd like to see or see less of, more of. Uh, I appreciate it. So talk on X or IG and I'll see you

# sales, focus & systems... (40min Q&A) | EP66
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpjGXnwxK5E

In today's video, we're going to have some fun and go through our weekly weekend Q&A round four. All these questions were submitted over the last week to the request box and we're going to deep dive all of them. Now, warning, a lot of these generally are a little bit more beginner friendly versus the other videos on the channel that are more tactical and thinking based around when you're already at a couple hundred thousand to over seven figures a month. All right. So, we're going to go through things everything from standing out in saturated niches, structuring your HubSpot to get team data, sales structures, how you know if your team is doing a good job, mindset, identity, all the things. And we are going to wrap it up with advice I would give my 20-year-old self. Great. Can't wait. So, last year we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We have now done 73.5 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. No guru, no courses, no nothing. Everything on the channel is to share what did work for us, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to over 100 million a year. And the whole goal of this is so I can find talent for our companies, opportunities in the space, and network with cool people doing cool  All right, so let's get into it. First one, I'm an 18-year-old from UAE. Dope. Uh, looking for opportunities to work on. What would you suggest suggest for me to learn or woke upon? Learn. Okay. Uh, I've stumbled upon the ecom industry or service-based industry and I'm quite unclear on what I could achieve. So, I'd appreciate some suggestions. Um, all right. So, Iman talks about this. It's actually like one of the selling points when he used to do the service when he used to sell for agency stuff. Um, and starting something that is service- based is your time essentially is the cost to do it, right? Versus something like ecom, you are running ads generally speaking and you are also then paying for a physical product. There are return there are like refunds, there are returns, all the stuff. So, starting with something in service is generally speaking going to be the easiest thing to do. Um, it's like crypto trading, like all that kind of stuff. Also has a cost and you can lose a lot versus service. You are just spending your time. Okay. So, what I would do is pick something a resultbased thing for a specific niche. So, you're going to help plumbers get clients. You're going to help, you know, online brands do, you know, physical product store that sells XYZ thing. Do this. Uh, one thing that's big right now that I see is AI. AI is really the mechanism and what you're doing, not the result you're getting them. Um, so you can do that exact same thing. Pick a niche, call it. Again, I'm just saying using plumbers as an example, but you're going to help landscapers or plumbers get XYZ result by using AI. Uh you can use the AI buzzword. There are plenty of people who are doing like AI agency. Just make sure you filter out the because there is plenty of that of people who sell stuff. There are tons of guys though that I see on YouTube that you can go watch for free that do like full courses on how to do it. And then also some paid courses and communities that just make sure you join ones that have uh client success results and the person teaching it has done it and or runs an AI agency or has run one. Um so you know that you're learning from somebody who knows how to do it. Saw your pod with Eddie and talked about focus is our biggest uh episode and that was two ago which is great. Um I have some I have the same type of supercomputer running brain like you. I do not have a supercomputer running brain. Uh my question is what tricks or how do you focus on things for a long period of time? Um, I would actually say I don't do this very well. Like I'm extremely scattered right now uh with doing this on like personal side for YouTube. There's like personal business side at some level and then also running the company and operating within that and then trying to have like a personal actual life like it's not working. So I'm doing a very bad job of it. Uh but what I can answer is how looking at things over long periods of time, right? It's like discipline versus motivation. At some level I'm just like tying myself into this and just doing the discipline. And then I'm on day 60, whatever, five, six in a row of doing these videos. And the thing the the tactic that has helped me is time blocks. So when I've stuck to them, I like live by the calendar. So if it's on the calendar, I'm doing it. The biggest issue I've had is not putting things on the calendar. Like today, for example, I have like three things on the calendar, but I've still been at this desk for like eight hours already or more and, you know, gone to the gym and done this and that, but like those were the only things I went to because they were on my calendar at those times. So for me, it is blocking those out. And then the other I think what you're kind of talking about here is like the focus portion of it. I just don't take on other stuff or I allow myself to do it by saying I'm scratching the interest itch but knowing that it's not going to like become a whole thing on the side. Uh we talked about this a lot in the pod about how like he does a good job of having partners so he can do other industries or other pieces within the industry, multiple companies, multiple projects with partners. I have not gotten good at that. I've never done that. So, it's something I want to learn how to do because there are definitely things I want to do that I need help with where I just don't have the time of the day or I'm not good enough is probably a better way to say it at structuring my time to do so because you have people like, you know, Elon who's obviously a rare case, but who has multiple companies and he has huge teams and all that, but he does manage to split his focus across those and still achieve like insane results. So, it's possible. Um, I don't know that I'm the person to look to on how to do it though. So, how to stand out in saturated niches, weight loss as an example. Um, so how you're going to stand out in any niche is going to be results one is definitely a thing. Um, now results aren't going to necessarily market themselves though, but just having great result, you're going to get unlimited clients through referrals and whatever. I mean, think to the extreme of anything if you have like the magic pill style of anything. You are going to get endless amounts of customers because it the product is so good. So you know having your product as the marketing and then within marketing side of things if you are you know have a general product or a normal product which most of us have uh it is going to be standing out with something that's unique. That's why everyone does you know go to ClickBank and see they're selling the same things but they all have different like unique mechanisms and how they are marketing them. People use the same methods of acquisition. So you know VSSLs or opt-in funnels or um direct to application or low ticket like they all use a variance of them. webinars, for example, but they stand out by having unique messaging and unique mechanisms that they use. Um, you know, the 7-day fast this the uh, you know, what's one that's right now like PDF farming, like you know, this unique angle to sell digital products. All you're selling is, you know, PDFs, but it's done in this unique crazy way that does XYZ. Like that's how they stand out is they do it by creating a lure around what the actual like mechanism to get the result is. And they're all, you know, there's 10 different things that get you the same result. They all get you financial freedom or whatever. Uh or you know the body of your dreams, but they use different mechanisms that are like this little known secret that does this this unique way to get the result that you don't understand and that you have to buy or talk to someone on the phone or whatever to get. What is a fair percentage of revenue to take from a client take to earn from a client uh who you manage who you make landing pages, emails, and SMS for? That one's very difficult. Um there are that's very difficult to answer because it completely depends on how how deep you are ingrained in it, how much you are iterating on it, how much you are tied to a lot of things, which is actually kind of like what you're asking. But like I could pay someone $1,000 to do a landing page or a ton of emails and SMS for me. Like so there are people who already will do it. So it's a commoditized service. It is the result in which you get. So, when you're asking for a percent, you're already, in my opinion, like thinking the right way or you're asking, I just want what it generates. Like, there are sales reps and agents, whatever, that come in as full stack and like eat your CRM and go through it and they'll take a higher percentage because they're generating revenue from what they currently have. With this, they're generally, depending on the traffic source or whatever, they're generating clicks already on their own, uh, which is a big lever, right? Like traffic, and you are helping them convert them through landing pages, email, and SMS. So, I've seen people do rev share deals that are actually pretty large, like tens and 20 or whatever percent because it's rev. Like, there's costs against that a lot of the time. If they're doing paid, there's ad cost. If they they have a sales team, there's sales team cost. They're fulfilling on it instead of an info product, there's team cost. Then you have overhead and softwares and everything. So, like straight rip off the top of revenue is kind of crazy. Um, I know guys who do it in low ticket who will do like 20 G's up front and then who will build a whole low ticket thing and then it'll take whatever 4% or 7% of the low ticket revenue which again just eats into things because a lot of time they're doing paid. So I don't necessarily know that I have an exact answer for you other than you have to understand how much value you are generating for them and it the revenue is likely not the number of because that's not necessarily the value they're getting especially if they have other call structures which is like a little bit out of your control but to say take profit share is also likely not good because you can't control cost and that'll be a downside for you. So I mean honestly I would start as high as you can if you're this if you're this person. um landing pages, email and SMS can be extremely valuable. Uh you can get 10% of everything you generate from email. If they already have a ton of emails, you can get more than that even. So yeah, I would just make sure you understand how much value you're actually providing from them for them and then try and do the mental math of how much profit they're actually making from it, not just like how much rev because rev is just like a vanity metric. It's like when I say 70 million or 73 or whatever million, it's like vanity metric at some point. Like we use it, you know, I use it a little bit for like clicks, but it's like we didn't take home $73 million in cash. I can tell you that. So, you have to make sure like if we paid someone 10% of of rev, we would be railed right now because, you know, a lot of a lot of companies don't have great margins at scale. So, you just have to figure out what makes sense for that business, but you can definitely get a percentage. So, uh, would you do a free book opt-in or, uh, to a VSSL to book a call? A free book opt-in to a VSSL or would you do just an opt-in for a free training to a VSSL to book a call? The book is the book attracts my target customer and can get me cheap and somewhat qualified leads versus when I run ads to a free training opt. Um, okay. So, I understand what you're saying. So you're saying if you run you're trying to do both these and when you run the book one you get cheap leads but when you run the training you don't. Um so what that means is that people value this book more. They think they have a higher likelihood how it's framed. Uh they think they have a li higher likelihood of getting the result or whatever you are trying to teach them or help them achieve uh versus the training. So that just means that your training is not framed in the right way or they don't see it as valuable. Now, people do just inherently like there is a lot to say about a book funnel. Um, there are guys, Chris Benetti, I believe his name is, and someone else uh that specifically do this. They help you basically create books that are like massive lead magnets. Um, and usually you're going to do that when you have something high ticket because it is a like it's a consumption thing. It's you're sending someone a physical book. It sits on their physical shelf. They actually read it. they spend hours of time with you versus when you run a VSSL, you know, it's 22 minutes long or something and they maybe watch half of it or, you know, all of it and you only have them for 22 minutes and then you're trying to get them on a call. So, it it's all about consumption for the book uh there. And you're saying they're somewhat qualified. Yeah. I mean, that's a bit of a different problem. You need to make sure that they're qualified people are the ones that are getting the book because it doesn't matter if someone who's not qualified is unless they're somehow going to refer you someone who is qualified. Um, but yeah, that's what I would do there. So, book a and then here actually add this when you do a free book funnel to book a call. Uh Anek was talking about this at the event that we went to where when he will do a low ticket like this or a something like this, he will put the VSSL in there as like a bonus they get. They qualify for a free master class and bolt it on after. So, you can package this like if right now you're already getting them for this book. I I wonder if this is a physical book or just an ebook or whatever. Ebooks are a lot different than a physical. Um, but you can bolt it on as a master class that they get qualified for this training, but it sounds like a framing of your training or what you're talking about is not great. So, I would change the framing and just mess with it until you until it clicks. Hopefully that was helpful. Um, how do you structure your HubSpot and get the team to update updating things uh diligently? I can't speak. Um, so I assume you're talking s I'm going to actually answer both these because it's HubSpot sales structure and this. So, how do you structure HubSpot? So how we do that for the sales structure is essentially everything is going to come in at the contact level because we for us there's no like companies is not B2B. So you have like companies that exist. A company can have multiple contacts and then contacts can have deals and we're just going to talk about those three or we're really only going to talk about contacts and deals. A contact exists and will have all the marketing information that happens about them. All the communication that happens. So they have dates as fields of when they opted in if they you know reopted in. We have like different stages of where they're at in the funnel and then all the dates of when they did the different things. So using a VSSL optin funnel, you have the opt-in date, you have the application date, you have the booked date, the day they booked on, the day they booked for, you have the close date, and every other thing in between. So like all their application information, all their booking information, we collect the phone multiple times just in case they give you different ones, all the tracking information, all of that is at the contact level. And then that's all automated. And then when somebody books a call, it generates a deal. So it auto creates a deal or autopop populates a deal that will be set for the close date of the day of the call and will also carry over all their application information so the sales rep can see all the communication all their application information um time of call everything and we'll auto assign to the person who it uh who they booked with through the round robin it'll auto assign them through HubSpot and then the second part of your question getting the team to update things diligently uh there's you're always going to have slippage on this the real way to do it is to make it So it is tied to comp. So no one's going to it up if it's how they get paid. So you need to have like approvals in place like for us once someone lands in the deal is created and the deal stage inside the pipeline is assigned to call scheduled and then you know eight different things can happen. They can no-show they can cancel. They could be completely disqualified. They can be uh pending short-term pending you know long-term nurture closed or lost as in like I could have won it but I lost it. Um I think those are all of them. And uh you will you basically need to keep that pipeline up to date. And then we actually have an approval one. So someone will submit it to approval instead of just marking it as one. And then the sales admin team will confirm that the dollar value is actually what was cash collected from the billing uh team and they will confirm that that's there. They'll confirm the SDRs on there. They'll confirm all that kind of stuff because at the deal level will also track SDRs in there because that's the two-way comp. So those will never get messed up if you tie it to comp. the stuff in between on like did they show, did they not, whatever. You need to put in some sort of like penalizing thing. You need to some have someone who audits it, who knows, you know, if there actually was a call, if there wasn't, especially if you're doing KPIs around things like close rate and stuff like that. Um, but yeah, so I'd focus on that to start. I think that'll get you plenty of the way of kind of like what you're asking me here. Um, but yeah, so that's the core. Feel free to ask like much deeper questions in these than I can answer. Um, but that's kind of vague. Uh, not trying to be sus, but can we get a side shot of the hair? a looks good but can't tell it's a little longer. I just got my haircut today. It's short as on the side and this usually stands out but I have a hat on. That's I don't know how to answer that. Uh how do you know or how do you manage people? How do you manage people and or learn how to manage people? What systems do you use? 3690 scorecards KPIs one ones. Um I am not the best at this and I haven't managed a ton of people directly in current state. I don't even know that you call it managing. I basically like operate and like gather like we have some strong leaders in place and those leaders have team. Um but we do yes we have target goals but we have them as a company combined or department combined. We have scorecards same thing that are department combined. There are people that are uniquely uh dedicated and are in charge of a specific number. So yes, they come here and fill out the ski a scorecard for a department and you know a media buyer is specific for these. The creative is for these the uh sales team is or the sales manager is responsible for these like all those different ones and they have KPIs that they are targeting and need to hit. So yes on that same with sales a lot of them are automated. We do also make people do manual ones for meetings even if they're pulling it from an automated one because we need them to be tied to the numbers. We literally just today were like everyone needs to like emoji respond to the dashboard that fires into the channel every day to understand that you guys are like privy to the numbers because all the data in the world is at our fingertips and if you guys don't know what they are and are not changing behaviors based on them to impact them. Um that's huge. So I think that answers that. And then KPIs we have like floor and base ones that are for actual just roles and then also targets. So goal KPIs as well as like minimum KPIs and then one to ones. So yes, the team has one to ones. We're really heavy in the sales and setting world. They'll do those like weekly basically. Um and then the CPO will do she's done it a couple times where she does oneto ones with everyone in the company just as like a pulse check and that's happened multiple times and they have it in the entire coaching department. They do it monthly as well. Um and then for a long time with ops we did it onetoone uh I'm sorry uh weekly one to ones and now we just changed those over. We don't do like the crazy in-depth like and what's going on in your personal life and what's this and that like we already touch base on a lot of that stuff and like we will have moments where you have like depth around that but a lot of it is workrelated now and we changed them to for this like third layer I made a video about this but we have like our main ops meeting that's like all the sea level basically and then we have department specific syncs that are with just like sales management and us as ops uh and like owners and then they have their meeting department where they do weeklys with their entire department which are like the actual sales team and they go across there. So these ones the one to one at this level is happening like in a department sync that's 30 minutes a week. Um and we're try we're trying that right now. So how you actually learn how to do it there are a million books or way smarter people than me that do this for their entire careers and for 50 years have managed people and scaled teams and done all that. So I would not ask me because I don't have enough experience. But hopefully that helped the systems part. How do you know if your head of people is doing a good job? Um so for us our head of people is also head of product. So we know it is doing good job when product has good there and when people are happy. We like to track the uh you know people track like churn of team metric. We track if somebody we wanted to stay leaves um as like the main metric which I think is fair because it's like you know you're not doing a good job if people you want to stay on the team are leaving uh versus if people are just churning like sometimes you just you know hire fast fire fast style um or even hire fast fire slow on accident sometimes or someone just you know changes up in life and it's time to make a change or they have other goals and stuff like that's perfectly fine. So uh you know they're doing a good job if they are depends on what you're using them for like if it's for recruiting and hiring like are they hitting KPIs on that uh in terms of running the team uh and doing oneto ones are they get gathering feedback that's actually valuable that when implemented has positive effect on these KPIs and growth of the company are they holding culture like ours is a really really good um baseline for our culture like lives true and true our core values and towards our mission and um you can just see that in how she operates how she is in channels when you watch back recordings of things she has in one onetoone or group settings. You can just tell um in that. So, I don't know that that's a great answer in terms of like KPIs and hard measurables, but it depends what you have them doing in terms of hard measurables. So, hope that helps. How did you get to your current position without ever going heavy on personal branding? I fell in trap where everyone used to be posting on social media and building their personal brand and now I just feel burnt out constantly posting about my boring life and feel that. And I understand a bunch of social tactic tactics like hooks, thumbnails, etc. of being the face of brand just isn't me. I'm an introverted tech geek. Feel that. And I know I don't have the face or personality for social media and I wish I could just go into cave mode like you did. But then I hear all these voices from Brussell Brunson and Gary Vee saying I need to be posting content. I'd love to just do as you do, lock in building systems and start because I don't have friends in the space. Also feel that and I don't have a bunch of case studies under my belt to show employers or partners. Um all right. So the I feel a lot on a lot of the levels. So this is a good one. How did I think about what the question of this all though now that I have some context is how did you get into your current position without going heavy. So I got into the current position by eating and like building sales pages and just doing random stuff as service work. So I was trying a bunch of different online random stuff. I never stuck to anything. That was on me. I was in all the right courses. People were getting success around me and I didn't and that is on me, right? The courses work. The programs worked. You can buy any course. You can buy that thing I was talking about earlier, the AI agency course and make it work as this person and never need to be forward facing ever. Like you do not need the personal brand at all. Um Russell Brunson, you know, these guys have crushed this. Hormosi crushes this on how they do personal brand. Um like but you don't need to do it in order to be successful because what you're trying to do is just get the result. The what the personal branding is is connection. It is it's like inbound. Think of everything like a funnel, right? It's like it's traffic to you. So, what I said up there about like what I do this for is I do it for talent, opportunities, and network. I sat in a cave for seven years and built  or longer. And if I wanted to get talent and post somewhere, I had like, you know, 500 people from my hometown or like my family and friends or whatever that would like they're not going to be able to help me get talent for our company, find new opportunities in the space or network and have conversations and talk about work or like new things or what's working now or anything. So that's why I started doing this. And as soon as I started doing this, I got all of that within, you know, x amount of time. And yes, I assume at some level it's because I can talk about stuff that I learned while building in the cave. Like I I learned everything doing it. So how I got into the position was just building and just doing real time and buying courses and learning things and implementing and going as we went through. And you can do that anywhere. So whether you start as a you know just cuz it's only the space I know but if you start inside like an info business people are always hiring for systems tech like we're hiring for that right like I'm about to rebuild out that department and that division and like it's there it just depends on what level or size of company you can enter if you don't have a lot of experience directly like you know you don't necessarily need case studies to get a job but you need like experience which is kind of the same thing um but in smaller companies like I didn't have case studies user experience and I was like, you know, number four or five on the team and it was just cuz I vibed with the co-founder and it was just like, you know, we were both just building and trying stuff online and I had x amount of experience but not really. I was not making much of any money, you know, five grand here, 10 grand here on random stuff, but it's about it. So, I would do I mean, yeah, you posting content I think is cool. I wish I kind of would have done it seven years ago and had like the the true buildout and I have like a random Instagram stories or snap memories of me doing stuff but like I wish I would have done more because it's cool to look back on and you know as long as you just keep going like you're going to hit it. It's not if it's you know when. So I would do that. I would go try and find a gig somewhere. Try and do something that's like growth operating growth operator e um or where you can have like more leverage to have the potential for higher income other than making you know five grand a month working somewhere. But you can also get paid to learn stuff. You can get paid to be a media buyer and you know spend someone else's money. You can get paid to build pages and figure out what works and then you know without testing any of your own money. You're literally getting paid to like learn. So I would just focus on that especially if you're here and then you can post content about what you're learning. I think the biggest thing and like what I'm trying to do here too is similar is like I'm trying as best I can to like have this come off how it feels which is like no ego. Like this is what we are literally doing right now. This is, you know, what everything I talk on is just stuff that we have learned from doing and that has failed and some stuff that has worked. And I think the value in being able to post like that is like, you know, you you become a funnel builder inside one of these companies that launches, you know, a new challenge funnel every month. And it's like now we're building this and you have and like, you know, be careful what you're sharing if they haven't launched anything, but or if you're allowed to, but sharing about how you're building it, sharing it with like other there's other people just like you, whether it's 10 or 10,000 that are doing the same thing and think it's cool. Whatever you're doing, anything you're doing, if you're weaving baskets, there's people who do that. So like just finding your pocket of people on the internet and then as you begin to scale up it's like you know maybe it's just page builders for info then it's page builders for ecom and then it's uh it's like media buying for ecom and like the funnel gets bigger as you scale up and it's like uh you know if I talk about this all of a sudden next thing you know it's like personal it's online business generic then it's like you know uh personal development then it's like these different things are different sizes but you don't have to start huge nor should you. So hopefully that helps. I don't know. I don't really know if I answered that. Mindset and identity. I don't know what that means. What was the question? Provide a topic request. Mindset and identity. Oh boy. I don't know if I have any. Uh I mean I randomly post them on here. Yesterday I posted about the bottleneck theory, you know, as my coin joke thing, but like it basically just is like it's the big it's the big thing, the one thing. There's books on this that there's one thing in your business or your personal life that is holding you back right now. And whether that is your opt-in rate on your uh opt-in page, whether it's your close rate of your sales team, whether it is you sitting in front of your computer for four hours a day and actually just doing it or 14 hours a day and just doing it. Um, mindset and identity. I don't know. That one's tough. I I don't really know what you mean on it specific, but yeah, my identity has shifted a ton. And I think I'll answer a little bit actually more of that when I get to this one. So, 21, been in sales and marketing for the past four years. Nice. took over 4,000 sales calls or discos. Working with multiple seven and eight figure agencies, okay, agencies, consulting, SAS, lead genen for realators, scaling online pts, which I assume is personal trainers, even helping the creator economy monetize their brands with digital products, challenges, communities. Okay, so you have some chops looking to launch my own offer and I'm at a crossroad. 50 to 100K months with the target. Cash flow is a priority so I can play the equity game. I don't know what that means. Uh 50 to 100K, so that's just arbitrary months with the target. So, just to like live your life, I assume is the cash flow is why you want that. And then, oh, so then you can build something that you're not making cash flow on and then potentially sell later. Got it. Don't want to be a part of the coaching coaches to go to coach coaches industry. I'd like to stay away from sales calls. Okay. Only on page or DM closes. Okay. Might have to eat some  for a minute. Sorry. Uh, what offer niche positioning comes to mind of what you're doing here? Uh so this whole I don't want to coach coaches how to coach coaches thing that can be solved very easily by if you're going B2B in this style and like when I say B2B it's like selling to people who are coaches consultants whatever it is selling a unique mechanism or process. So if you're coaching coaches on how to coach like whatever like I get that but if you're teaching them if you're teaching coaches and consultants how to do a specific thing in a specific unique way or framed as a unique way and you have good results doing it that's very easy to sell. So, you know, all these info coaching, you know, consulting people buy from each other because they have different things. One person knows how to crush it with webinars. One person is like the VSSL god. One person is like crushing it with organic or like Tik Tok traffic. One person is like that's why they all buy from each other is because they have unique mechanisms even though they all have the same business model but generally for other niches. So, if you can teach them a unique mechanism for their business of their niche, you can crush it. I don't really know what that is specific to what I see in your experience. Um, broadly, I'd like to do it in I' I'd like to be in the healthier business, richer demographics and something. Yeah, I mean, go richer no matter what. Go for someone who's doing 100k plus a month minimum, you know, I mean, stuff like that. Don't sell to 0 to 10k people unless you have something dialed and you're trying to do volume. Would you suggest scaling coaches growth operator model? Launch a bio longevity offer big into hybrid training soccer. Okay, so sport thing. Sorry, I should have read this. Um yeah, I mean you can growth operate things. Uh Josh Gavin has a course or something or coaching that's um called uh like offer publisher and it's basically around like finding somebody that would be like a soccer MMA run somebody who's like the expert and then you build a business around them. You understand the sales, the marketing, that piece of it. So you would build a business around them as the growth operator. And generally speaking, you can take majority of the company when doing it. Depending on how you can structure it and depending on how you can sell it in the beginning, you might have to have less if it's your first go at it. But if you have experience, you can you can definitely get majority. Um but yeah, or you just build it yourself as the expert. But yeah, do this for sure because if you use the sales and marketing thing and don't sell it to sales and marketing and info online people, uh it crushes, right? Right. So it's like if you were to you know you see people on X or on YouTube all the time talking about applying these principles of online marketing and using them for local business or you know untapped like industries in that way. You just crush it. So a lot of them have been hit at this point. So there's a model to I wouldn't look at that as competition or like saturation. I would look at that as like someone else has already done it. Um so I think that's helpful. Would you suggest I only focus on one domain through YouTube and ads? Um, if you're talking about teaching them, yes, teach them through one dis like teach them only YouTube ads or only Facebook ads or only Tik Tok or only organic or whatever. And like there can be stuff into the future that helps them, but like most people, especially if they're beginners, you know, you only need to master one traffic source for, you know, a million a month depending. Um, there's a Yeah. So, and then for you, same thing. It's like you only need to do that for a million a month. So, curious where you see opportunity and if there's anything that excites you in the market right now. Um, I set it up here. I like that AI stuff. I think that it's pretty when people are like because it's all about getting the person the result. Again, I've said this like four times, but it's like if you're trying to help somebody get clients, it's like what is the mechanism in doing so? You're going to help them run ads, you're going to do whatever. I mean, they don't really, most of them, depending on the niche you're in, like don't care how you're doing it. All they want is the result. So, the difference with the AI thing is like it kind of has that little sparkle in it, which I guess paid ads did at one point, but it has that sparkle of like, oh, I'm using AI to do it. And you can get a little bit of like leverage in doing that in the sales process, but you have to make sure that it actually works and you're actually using, you know, AI. And where I see AI, I mean, it's everywhere, but like a lot of the time it is savings, it's efficiencies, it is uh distribution and like output increases. It's like doing things more or better. Um, a lot of the time. And I'm completely, you know, there's a million other things I don't even know about, but I like that one, I think. And then I really do like this whole build it around an expert. That's what we did or that's what the co-founder did with the other co-founder before I even came on. I didn't have the wherewithal to understand that was a business model when it happened. So hopefully that's helpful. What would you give your 20year-old self? Advice. What advice would you give your 20year-old self? Sit the down. Humble yourself. Keep working. Have more fun. Don't party. Uh those come to mind at 20. I was a show. Um, at 20, I don't even know. I was coming back here. I had failed business online. I was trying to learn the online thing. Uh, I hadn't yet gotten to this yet. So, I was just doing random online stuff and like back near my hometown after failing, you know, going west and doing that and failing and was there for a couple years. I'm trying to think where I was at that point. And then at that point I went out and you know moved over towards like a kind of bigger city vibe and was trying to do agency service work. So like trying to build websites and do paid advertising for people. And I had a couple people I did that and I was building like physical stuff like physical dashboarding units and like behind like uh TV screens for physical businesses to like have dashboards and all that. Um what advice would I I mean honestly it would be that it would be like it I would be understand what your goal is. know that if you just keep working, you're going to hit it at some point. So, like, have fun now because there are things you can do at 20 and 21 and 24 or whatever that you can't do the same when you're 30 or 40 or 60. And like I try to remind myself that all the time. There are things that you have access and opportunity to do depending on what's important to you that you can only do at that age. And you have like the young opportunity to do whatever. So, like swing big and try to get into higher leverage things. Also, like if I was talking to my 20-year-old self, it doesn't have this. If I was talking to a 20-year-old right now, there's so much opportunity on in the online stuff, like just hang out on X in Telegram, on YouTube, like these guy or Tik Tok, whatever. Like these guys crush it. And just making sure that you're like morally aligned because this stuff follows you and reputation and all that. And I feel like I almost like learned that the hard way. Like I'm sure there's people that don't like me and don't, you know, an ego and stuff because I was not the best person. Like I was just, you know, I didn't really care. I didn't really have a lot of skills. I started making a bunch of money and it was just like not the best. And you know, I regret that side of it. So, I would just try and really stay humble and just like lean into things when there's momentum. I didn't do that. You know, I caught momentum, made a bunch of money or did whatever and then like kind of like took a foot off the gas and then the rebuild process to catch the momentum from falling is harder. And then to re get into momentum is even harder. Uh, and I think I would have reminded myself of that. And then yeah, just like everything's fun, you know, you just have fun and everything. work with cool people, do good things, do goodbye people. Um, just kind of the core stuff you'd hear. Um, but yeah, for my specific 20-year-old self would definitely be that. Um, and yeah, take big risks. Take big risks because you can do it there and the worst case is you get a job somewhere for 55k until you try the next big thing. It's like you can work anywhere and yeah. So, hey man, this is JP. I'd like to understand what your primary KPIs that you guys track and are super important to track in order to figure out where your company is at. Okay. Are there any specific KPIs you automatically calculate through Google shoots or whatever CRM? Any specific KPI that you think everyone should track based on what sector in the company? Like if you have sales team, marketing team? Um, yeah. So, okay. So, I guess what you're you're asking is like overall like let me think about this. Overall, like company healthwise is going to be like cash metrics. So, but then they also touch like everything. So, if I was to look at marketing, it's like rorowaz, it's cost per throughout the entire funnel. I do I did a video on this like talking the marketing numbers but like say your target is 4x new rorowaz like tracking that religiously and that's new cash rorowaz um tracking like total revenue and like future talking tracking cash collection on that and then for the big overall company it's just like what's your what's your like cash flow of it and understanding that and then understanding all your costs really well and like how much as a percent they are of your total cash as well as like just the new cash and like unit. So knowing those and you can automate those pretty easily once you bucket them. So you just basically have to bucket them. Um but a lot of the stuff is going to come from marketing if you're doing paid. So you can do a lot of math after that. The next is going to be sales team. That's going to be like activity and result metrics. So things like count of calls, things like cost per call that it comes from marketing. So you know the cost of it. I did a video on return on rep. So you can know you know what it truly costs you to have a rep both in basically like what is their acquisition cost portion as well as their commission portion. So someone who takes 150 calls versus someone who takes 90 calls, but they sell the same amount and get paid the same amount of commission. The one that took more calls is burning you more cash because they're burning, you know, the cost per booking for every single one because they close at a lower rate. So making sure you understand their close rates, the return on rep that you have, and then you're trying to basically figure out like a return on team metric across everyone. And I would hire into kind of offshoot, but I would hire into where it hurts and not try and overstaff early and like project where you're going to need to be. I don't think it's as important as maintaining the cash flow and you know keeping the profit higher. Um so yeah I mean we do a majority of ours where where you said like between the CRM and sheets or whatever. Uh CRM for us is sales almost exclusively for any of the metrics and tracking. But we even then offshoot it all into like databases that are like live two-way syncs. So we can look at all the data outside there because I hate HubSpot reporting or because I'm I'm just bad at it. I don't understand how to do it. I don't know how to do calculations in it like as easily as I can do in a sheets or like spreadsheet style math. Um, but again, that's just like a limiting understanding I have. And I'm sure I could hire someone and figure that out or learn it myself. But yeah, I mean, I would do that. And then you can also run it's so easy to be like oh I want this number like figure out a formula for yesterday for example that's like what was my yesterday's cost per lead total or total ad cost total uh cash collected total revenue generated total new re uh new cash and new revenue um total expenses and what was my you know booking count lead count app count and whatever like get all of those in one thing pretty simply in like one line through uh for yesterday and then take that formula, drop it in chat GBT and be like, "Okay, now give me this uh for last month and then give me this for last quarter and last whatever. Now give me that for where I'm uh what that is." And then you can divide it across the month or the quarter amount of days and then get your daily average, which will then give you your trending number because then you just multiply it out, right? It's like where you're trending at um based on where you're at actually for the month broken down to the day and then how many days are remaining which is you know the plus. So you can just feed these into GPT once you get the base formula. You can even probably get the base formula done for you in GPT and then you just build them into a sheet and that makes it dynamic. You can also hire someone to do it in Looker Studio. They'll do a ton of them. It's just like what you're asking to find the KPIs which is just go mark or go department specific and then for the overall you just need to know the core numbers. So it's like cash movements is the biggest thing. So there's like leading indicators and then you know cash movements is kind of like the output but knowing what connects to cash and like what your costs are like what's your cost per booking right now like if you don't know it like bad what is your average cash collected per call right it's like what like is there a 4x spread between that there's your new rorowaz roughly depending right so like you need to know these numbers pretty quick and with it and the second you don't know it and your cost per call is $400 and your average revenue collected or whatever is 500 on those calls is like you're in a world of hurt into the future and you I don't know it yet. So, just make sure you know those core numbers from marketing and sales for the acquisition side. And then for costs, just do your averages. So, if you have a coach, it's going to cost what per year versus what you got for per term. So, if you're selling a six-month program, a year program, one-time access, whatever, understanding what your costs are per unit, and then knowing if those change with volume. So, if you have a thousand clients, is it the same? So, if you're doing like onetoone coaching, it stays the same because you're paying them a hundred bucks to service something that's a thousand or whatever. and it stays the same. Or if you have something that's like group coaching or like group calls or whatever, the more volume you do, the coach generally speaking may may go up in tiers, but it's pretty consistent, so the percentage goes down. So just make sure you can keep the alignment. Um hopefully that made sense. But all right, what are we at? 38 minutes in. Hope this was helpful for you guys. Um if you go to www.ryclog.comdoc, ranclog.comdoc. I do all these videos every day and I document them in here with what the main idea is, the YouTube link and the category. So, marketing, tech, ops, sales, mindset, all the things. And yeah, the daily update is we're crushing uh in the right direction. So, I don't want to give too much because I want to give a good end of month for May, but over six figures a day uh for the last few and doing the right things. So, just need to stay consistent and we have a bunch of stuff changing. Saturday right now. We're launching some new stuff on Monday. So, feeling good about that. And then the X growth and the YouTube growth is great. So, appreciate all the support on that. Share this where you see them. Comment on this one. I'm trying to get a gauge on what you guys enjoy and don't. And I just made a post. I think I'm going to do more onetoone videos of just what is working now. What like just with absolute sickos in online space and in the world, just what's working now for them. Not really any story of like background story in the classic like podcast style stuff. It's just like what's working now? What is um yeah, I don't know what's working now. I feel like that's a good enough question right now. So yeah, start there and I appreciate you guys and talk soon.

# ONE thing is holding you back from your biggest month... | EP65
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAKAGAvyxs

In today's video, we're going to be talking about how you are one bottleneck away from your next record month, goal, or complete breakthrough in your business or life. We're going to go through the bottleneck theory and how to change your lens to view the one constraint that is in your business right now that is limiting your growth and then how to solve for it. All right, so we're going to go through real examples of how we are how we identify them and how we solve them and then go through the big shift here at the end which is going to be fixing versus replacing yourself, which is massive when solving for these on how you can grow into the future. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done 73.5 in total cash collected in this business. Took the screenshot right before this. And I am not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to over 100 million a year. And my entire goal here is to find top talent opportunities and build a cool network of people doing cool All right, so let's get into it. Uh before we start this, it's late. It's like 9:00 p.m. If you watch these, this is day 65 in a row of making these videos. And I just want to say all of this is my opinion. This is not there's no ego, no whatever. Like this is just us building in the trenches. We have done everything wrong you can imagine. Um and I want to make sure it stays that way. So no ego, no fluff. I know this much about our industry that's this big, then online business is this big, then overall business, and then life is this big. Like I know this much about a couple things, and this is my opinion on them. So let's get into it. Bottleneck theory and your lens. So this is how we view everything. I always say on here like everything uh everything's a funnel and you can look at that very easily with a bottleneck. So Russell says you're only one funnel away from a breakthrough. I'm saying you're only one bottleneck away. Same thing, right? So one constraint is limiting your growth. That can be in your sales process. That can be in your marketing process. That can be in your fulfillment. That can be in your thinking. Okay? So more volume does nothing in that case. An example of this, if you have a 5% opt-in rate on the beginning of your funnel on a VSSL opt-in funnel and your cost per call is $500 and you're trying to increase your VSSL and you're trying to make it or you're trying to increase the rate of your VSSL and get more engagement on it and get it to get a better rate, you are doing the wrong thing. You're solving for the wrong thing. More volume through that, no one even makes it to the VSSL. Okay? So, you need to understand that because your optin rate is so bad and this can be applied in anything, but more volume does not do anything and more throughput at other layers. Yes, it partially helps, but you're solving for the wrong thing and not finding the thing with the biggest lever. Okay? So, it'll be the same dollars, the same percents that will occur past that on the funnel, but you need to optimize for the right things. Okay? And then all about solving them. So, we're going to go through some real examples of how we're doing this. And I'm going to try and do these broken down like this. So, for marketing funnels, for example, we run three funnels. You can go uh in current state and you can go onto the channel and see I do like a full breakdown that's long and shows the full funnel break but VSSL opt-in funnel a DTA which is a direct application funnel. So headline VSSL and then apply button and then a low ticket. And for us low ticket is focused on ascension not on AOV and like front-end profitability. We're just trying to liquidate 50% of it. So with a VSSL funnel for us right now how we are testing and what we're trying to solve for in these funnels really in the end is the cost per acquisition. Okay. So, yes, you can have some one funnel that runs that has a $500 cost per call and you have one that runs a $50 cost per call. That does not mean that that does not necessarily mean because you have a $50 one that's going to pass through at the same conversion rates after the fact. Okay? So, for a VSSL, you're optimizing around the opt-in rate. You're optimizing around the application, the booking, the clo the show, and then the close. Okay? DTA, you're optimizing around the application, the booking, the show, the close. So, you don't have the opt-in in that one. And for low ticket, you're optimizing for uh the front-end conversion percentage. You are then optimizing for the AOVish and the and the checkout conversion. You are then optimizing for us. We're going through a setter and then a book and then a closer. So, you have show rates on both those and conversions on both those to a client. Okay. To a close. So, for us right now, the big thing is our VSSL is working and it has worked, but it has died out and it was because we were not solving for the right bottleneck. And the right bottleneck was more so around the entire messaging and how much it's been used in the marketplace versus testing a different funnel and it not actually being the funnel which is like the funny part what I'm trying to get into here is like the bottleneck itself was not the metrics on the funnel. It was not it was but it was overall across the funnel and it was because of the messaging because there was no nothing new there. DTA the issue here is we were solving for a constraint of trying initially because I'm I'm telling you what we did wrong because we've done everything wrong. we were solving for the booking cost and for what we were trying to optimize for when what really now the bottleneck is and what we're looking at is the throughput is there right the costs are there but it's not backing out because they don't have the consumption because they don't have those layers low ticket for us right now initially we're like oh we just need to get the CPA down the net CPA we just need to get the the net CPA all the way down and what really we needed to be focusing on this entire time was actually how the messaging of the whole thing and the messaging of the entire funnel was built for a warmer audience ience. So it cannot be scaled to the same layer. Now there's different theories around this and beliefs like you can use it as retargeting or not but solving for that. Okay. Now in the business actually before we do this as a whole marketing was the issue. We were not fully booking calendars. So we were like oh marketing is the issue marketing is the issue. We're hiring for CMO. We're trying we're building out an entire division over there. We get calendars fully fully booked and we're like okay we solved this bottleneck right the macro of the department. Now we're booking fully. And then it was going to the sales team. they weren't closing and we're like, "Oh my gosh, it's still marketing. It's marketing. It's marketing. We're solving for this. Like, we're not getting them quality. We need more uh consumption. We need more this." Like, the creatives are wrong. Everything. In the end, it ends up being the sales team. So, for a sales team, the different layers of the bottleneck that we are solving for right now is like, "Okay, cool. Now, we have new cso in absolutely crushing it for us. He's one week in. So, but like he's he's setting the tone, like absolutely setting the tone. um and is solving for this close portion. But now what is higher leverage in there beyond the close, right? So the close very very impactful. Now before that, how many people do they get to talk to? Because you could close 80% of the people you talk to, but if you only get to talk to a 20% show. So how we're then optimizing shows and then the biggest one that we are identifying as a bottleneck is how many hours are they actually working for the team size? Okay, so we do salary, we do W2. Um and the expectations around hours has then opened our eyes to the call length being an issue. So, like you're just going down this rabbit hole because the second you crack one of these, you crack something on a marketing funnel and your cost per call goes from 100 to 50 with the exact same quality, it's like night and day. Like all of a sudden, either you're doing more throughput or your costs are way down. So, either your profit is way up or you're scaling into it because you now have the bandwidth on the back end because you're filling calendars, right? So, on a VSSL funnel, on a DTA, and kind of on a low ticket for us, the the literal bottleneck if you look at the funnel flow is calendar availability. So you can fill calendars, but now you have to make sure there's quality on them. Okay? So it's kind of constantly this dance. But we solve we solved marketing. Then we moved into solving sales and now we're here solving this. And just this like within a week, we are now same funnel, same flow, same lead quality, same volume, and we're closing like double the amount of units because of the frame shift of how we're doing things with the close and how we're doing things with scripting and everything there. Now the next layer of this is making sure that we're dominating shows and making sure that they have the most at bats to close at the new high percentage and then hours opening up the bandwidth for how much team is there so that the volume per rep is actually higher and then all of this downstream effect right? So now it's like you have 10-hour block instead of a six-hour block. So there's bandwidth you have higher shows. So instead of only these ones showing you have this much showing and instead of this close rate you have this. So the entire thing throughput just went up like two and a half 3x depending could be like 1.5 to two but still so that is how the next piece of what we're solving for and then again we're going to go into this big the shift here because this is huge because huge so the renewal engine is the the next piece on top of that. So today's Friday we're solving for this on Monday. Honestly all these videos are me just talking on a daily basis of like what we're doing now and whether it works or not. I tell you if it works or not but this is our current plan um renewal engine. So for this it was how many are they connecting with? So somebody goes for a year and then has the opportunity to basically renew and buy again. But like what is the touch point? So first we optimized around connects. We solve for that. We're like okay cool before 60 days before that they renew. We're going to focus on setting an automation that gets them uh that pushes them to get on the calendar. So now you're going to have a drop off rate. You're going to have 100 people that are coming in that or I'm sorry that are basically at the point of almost the end of their contract and 100 of them are going to get this notification and 60 of them are going to book. So we're optimizing for that. So, we optimized for this piece, got as many as we could connected and on the phone with a like retention manager. Okay, they got on there. Now, what we realized was a big bottleneck here was the actual offer stack of what we were offering them because right now we were just saying, "Hey, here's a discounted another year of the same thing." Now, not to say that's an issue, but one that it increases LTO LTV overall, but it's a smaller cart and it also has the same fulfillment cost, right? Because it's still the same service delivery. It's still the same thing. So, what we're now doing is we're doing two different ones. So we're having the exact same offering but volume. So okay cool you could you did a year now let's do two or three. So we're going we're casting out the exact same one to one model at a discount. Okay. So that increases LTV like large because let's say someone's paying four grand and now you're going to do 10 grand or whatever for three years call it and it's like a crazy steal. And your fulfillment math is technically like it eats into margin more but you're getting more cash up front. And then as long as you just, you know, we there are tons of videos on this, but like if you're keeping that cash stocked away for future coach pay, you're solid and it's really just moving cash forward for you. And so you have to understand that you are eating into margin when you do that. The other model is actually one that has like way higher gross margin because it's a group setting. So the fulfillment portion of it. So we're going to have basically more of the same the same and then a a continuity downell version and having those different offers is going to get a higher take rate. That is my assumption. Okay. So having those and then it's also more gross margin for the company because the off the different offers have better margins the lower ones. Okay. And which is I assume is going to be a lot of people. All right. And then the next piece of that is the actual closes. So we're doing new scripting. We're doing a focus on that. All that launches on Monday. But that's how we're looking at it and solving for it. Again, I need to get to the shift part because you're going to you're going to like that part. So renewal retention is then the next portion and that's where I'm like forecasting out and trying to get ahead of and trying to solve for. So it's not actually a bottleneck. So like right now if I solved renewal retention, it's not even something that needs to be solved. So the biggest thing coming back to here is like finding the thing that right now is limiting the constraint because if you are not getting enough applications and then you're trying to optimize your sales process, it's like solve for the applications. Solve for the thing that is limiting the throughput of the overall org. Okay? So like if you're not getting enough bookings and filling calendars, it's like get more bookings. If you're not closing enough of them and you have full calendars, fix that. If you are churning customers left and right, fix the leaky bucket. And like you need to shift your focus to these different things. And it's hard when there's multiple, but I'm telling you right now, there is one core one at the at any given time that is the biggest needle mover in the entire company. And depending on where you sit in the org, that is generally speaking as an owner, a CEO, an operator, whatever, like a C level, that is your main focus, right? It's to keep it going everywhere else, but then to focus on that and solve for it. It's like I don't want to say all hands on deck because you don't want to distract, but yeah. So solving for renewal retention ahead of time just I'm just trying to like educate on it but that's activation making sure that those first x amount of days I'm trying to read the books that are talking about that keeping it sticky and keeping it like a really engaging community and then building it out as their lifer I just threw these ones on here but like just to talk about the idea of trying to get ahead of it and be proactive on like what the next bottleneck could be because the second now that marketing is filling calendars sales is like cranking it pours into fulfillment. So what is most likely to break next? If this was the bottleneck and solved, this is the bottleneck now solved. This is now the next one. It is, you know, you're onboarding 50 people a day, you are, you know, you have refund requests, you have CS, you have all this stuff, and trying to get ahead of that next bottleneck after you solve the first one. So solving the first one is going to get you your breakthrough in terms of dollars or like results. And then the next one being ready for it is huge, huge, huge, huge. Because if you can forecast it, you don't get caught like holding your hand, which we have so many times. And just I don't I don't even know how, but like we're here now. So the big shift fixing versus replacing yourself. So this can become a fix it hamster wheel where like I said there's always a fire to be put out and that is just life. Like that's just that's business. That's life. That's you're always going to have something that's the bottleneck or the constraint or the thing that's on fire but doing it. So right like it's an inevit it's inevitable. Now you can replace yourself in doing this and this is like the big idea here. So in the example of us doing it in marketing, we could have gone in and built out marketing and fixed it ourselves. And that's not like egoy or whatever like the team that we have in place can and did at some level do it. But instead what we did is we put a strong leader in place that really was the one who like led it and operated it through fixing it. Okay? So like replacing yourself in that so that now when you go and shift to the next one, you move to sales or fulfillment or whatever piece or your personal life explodes and you need to go focus on that. You know that where you're leaving it is not oh I fixed it one time and it's going to break again or you have a higher certainty that it will not happen because you don't just like keep your eyes off it and instead somebody else is responsible for that and driven through that with KPIs and and their focus as their main focus. So in that example CMO now we're doing it with sales, right? So like the CSO for actually came in and fixed it has experience way beyond what we have had with our you know personal best came in and is fixing it real time and that is a good example of like we replaced ourselves before even so like our job was really identifying the constraint solving for it by doing a hire. Okay, so that's like the higher leverage thing here. And then you know you have new you have new bottlenecks which is you know communication and structure and like making sure everyone needs their thing. But like the big bottleneck was that now next one is being able to replace yourself better. And what I mean by that is being able to replace yourself and not just know that it's going to maintain but that you have set the tone and or the person is the type of person who sets the tone on their own which is amazing and like dream state that is going to continue to grow this thing without you. Okay. So like truly turning it into a machine where if you guys are doing a million a month and you come back, you ideally want the team to at least keep the million a month, right? Across whatever division, whatever bottleneck that you solved and then you went on to the next thing. You come back and put your focus on, you check in and you're like, "Oh, cool. We're still at a million a month, right?" The dream dream state is that instead somebody has a built-in either themselves or is, you know, KPI or whatever to where they are growing it. So marketing is actually instead of just maintaining the calendars and just you know running the ads and it's built they are coming up with completely new offers they are coming up with new things they're constantly trying to drive the call the cost pers across everything down while also like maintaining the quality or increasing the quality at the same cost right same idea same thing with sales it's like if you move your eyes to this other department which is at some level where we up is we were like not looking at certain departments and being like oh they're good they're just you know they're just waiting or they're okay, we need to solve this bottleneck and then it'll be okay. And it is not the case all the time. And we have clear as day seen that is we have departments that were um not optimized and not growing in themselves and finding ways to continue to grow and hit new numbers even when there's bottlenecks. And that's the culture that we are trying to foster now is one of where you are continuously solving the bottleneck and they are continuously bettering themselves even when the focus of you know the entire sea level basically is on marketing to be like how can we fix this what assets can we do where can we fix you know whole new website whatever we're like all hands on deck but at the same time they are growing within their department fulfillment is continuing to grow so like this entire time for us fulfillment has been just like you know making sure they have the best people on team they have been you know people have churned on team and we have replaced with like killers and like they are ready and ready and ready. So you want to talk about a department that for us an example that is like proactive and ahead of it on trying to do that is them right now. This retention thing kind of been like wishy-washy over here like it hasn't been led in a way that where it has had the results or the data or the things around it. So it's like now we shift our focus over here and hope that marketing and sales is that. So hopefully that makes sense. Kind of a bit of a yap but yeah things are this is like where we're at. This is how I think about things. Think about everything as a funnel. um you're only one bottleneck away. And I mean that. I mean that in the truest sense. So if you've seen the other videos, you know, we were losing 20 grand a day. We were breaking even on the month. Um last month I showed, you know, we did 1.6, I think, in last month. And uh it's basically that's basically break even cash for us, which is like not cool um for where we're at with overhead and where we need to spend into to fill W2, all the stuff. Um and then we replace we, you know, crushed it with marketing, got it to that place. We now have the new CSO in and you know we're at 10und and something today and we're at 10 and something the day before and like we're right there now with the consistency on that side and it's only going to get better here. So now I am personally I mean I'm shifting my focus to making sure that these people have their stuff but really is where I'm focused is on the back end. That's why right now I'm posting on X and I'm talking about like you know community books and retention systems and uh you know mitigating churn and making products so valuable that you know they get pissed if their subscription fails like stuff like that. So that's what I'm solving for. So I look at everything like this. Um that's a bit of the daily update. So ww.ryclog.comdoc has all the videos I've made. I've done 65 I think is today in a row of this. I sort them by tech, marketing, sales, ops. I only know what I know. I don't know a lot. So this is our experience of things and literally just sharing what we did that worked. What we did a lot of things that did not work and what we're actively doing which is thinking this theory and solving in this way and we are getting results right now um you know in a short-term basis of we're increasing. So I'm excited to do the month in review at the end of this month of May uh because I think we're going to have some a decent growth from month prior and then into the next just like hammer it. So projection for this was, you know, a 90-day roll out of this and a week in we're seeing good results. So I'm interested to see kind of how fast this can take. Uh because we haven't changed anything other than, you know, basically vibe, numbers, structure, um vibe, numbers, structure, cadence, standards, like same things on there and just like in leadership and we've kept the same team. So yeah, uh I'm excited. So, I think yeah, we're right there. And then hopefully some of these videos soon will be three and five and six a month. And then we're going to do some other crazy stuff that's kind of like outside of the scope. I know I've been talking about these for a lot of it. And it's really what the business is, just more of the same. And then talking about additional things that are non-distracting that are just like supplemental uh increases in terms of how we run things on the back end, other ways to monetize, partnerships, stuff like that. But we are not there yet and we do not want to distract until we are. So hopefully this was helpful. Uh hopefully you guys understand what I'm saying when I'm like this is no ego. this is no anything and like I'm starting to get that weird feeling again of like people are taking it out of context and oh look at us and what we've done and that's not what this is. This is a way for me to network with cool people who are building There's a way for me to find talent. That's how I found the cso. This is a way for me to share and find opportunities and just network and talk to people because I don't talk to anyone in my like personal about this until I started making these videos and now I talk to people every day all day about this and I love it. So hopefully that was helpful. Um, let me know X Instagram. Happy to chat about whatever. I just answer anyone's questions. I'm happy to.

# the man doing over $10M/week (Eddie Maalouf) | EP64
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk7rLM-XOYQ

I can't I can't do a countdown. All right, guys. We're doing something different today. We got Eddie Malof here. Bad marketing. He was with us in Dallas, but he had left, so he was unable to be on our funny round table talk. So, I figured we'd get him on here and I'm going to try and do these like every week where we just have someone killer that you probably haven't heard of. Eddie, you probably have heard of, but what up Eddie? What up, dude? I'm excited, man. I can't believe I missed the round table, too. I'm the one who invited you to that event. You are. In fact, you're the one who invited and did every dinner and every everything and uh yeah, we just got to benefit from you. So, I appreciate that. Uh, all right. I fed your name into Chat GBT in deep research and I said, "Find every podcast, find every video, find every everything, and give me all the stuff that I would talk about with him based on what we talked about." So, we're going to start it off fresh. Did it do a good job? It did a fantastic job. Really? Wow. I I actually learned things cuz I know you like, you know, pretty well, but not super. And like I I've consumed a lot of your short form, but I haven't consumed some of the long form, but not like your story and your journey stuff, but I know some of that from us talking. Yeah. But literally kick it off direct entire video and everyone who watches this or who the target is of these is low seven to eight figure people. So I get comments not DMs non-stop that are people that are sending these to their team or they are doing like I have three or four pe three three that I talk to that do over 30 million a year in info that I didn't even know existed. I didn't know they're companies that do over 30 million in info. Those are the best though. Lot right. I mean, that's kind of what we were and then I doxed ourselves. But, uh, so yeah, a lot of no fluff, not a lot of beginners. There are some, but I try and like tailor those differently. So, all I want to do is real stories, wild scale, deep strategy, and then we're not going to dox anyone. We already do that at dinners and stuff where we talk and we're like, hey, we're not going to say names, but like no client names, none of that [ __ ] Just cuz neither of us want to do that and be those guys. So, insane stories, wild winds, brutal L's, all the scale. So, to start it, give me your give me your twominuter for people. So, I got things right here from basement to 300 staff, doing college dorm sales, betting on yourself. What's your What's your elevator? A little longer than elevator. Um, a little longer than elevator. I um started doing sales, which is why I think I'm good at marketing. I started doing sales. Um, got to a point where I was just closing everyone and I needed more leads. I got into marketing to get more leads. Then I realized I need to sell to more than one person um at a time, which was my biggest bottleneck. you can only close one to one. Um, and so I basically quit my sales job, went full-time into marketing, did it for my parents' businesses, and then, um, basically found out, you know, logically like I can't work with massive corporations here. I'm just a solo dude in the basement. Uh, but in the Middle East, I could go and get a massive client like, you know, uh, Burger King, Intex, which is like one of the biggest plastic manufacturers in the world. Um, VTEC, which is like the biggest toy manufacturer in the world. Like I got all these brands. I helped them build their ecom systems. Um, I worked with them in the Middle East, crushed it, got into the supplement space, crushed it. Um, and then started kind of just doing it in America, too. And even though I had all these results in the Middle East, it was pretty crazy. I was like a peasant here. Like, so all of those were that. So like parent stuff and all those and the supplement, those were all non US. You start Yeah, that's uh uh everything except the supplement was non US. Yeah. Uh, but I mean I'm talking insane scale like you know spending I mean at the time it was insane scale to me but I would spend like six figures a month and make a 40x ROI on it because no one else was doing it, right? So there wasn't even ecom in the Middle East. Um, so that was really cool. Then I came here did a bunch of supplement stuff. Um, also crushed it. Did some black hat stuff. I was selling Forex courses, dude. Back in 201 18 I was spending like a 100red to 300 grand a day on meta ads. uh honestly way easier than it was now. But we were running I mean dude we were running every single country in the world. We had our you know 73 country list that was banned like it was just so deep into the data and breakdown. I I don't do it that deeply myself anymore. I got a team obviously. Um but that's been that you know fast forward now we basically 2020 decided let's just start hiring people and actually building a company instead of Eddie doing all this. Yeah. Um and then now we don't have 300 employees. We have 192 as of today. Um, I think with AI it'll probably be less moving forward or the company Dallas. Yeah. Yeah. The company will either grow and we'll stay the same size. Um, or we'll maintain the same revenue and increase profit by decreasing staff. Yeah. Um, so we'll see where that goes. But yeah, now I'm um now I'm more of a CEO than I am a marketer to be honest. I'm in all of our accounts on the info side for sure. I'm in all our biggest accounts on the ecom side. Uh, but am I running ads myself? Am I clicking in GHL and Clickfunnels myself? No. But, you know, I can Yeah. I mean, like yesterday, for example, I looked at an account. I said, "Change this headline to this and do this on the opt-in page." And our opt-in went from 18% to 38% overnight. So, like that's that's my doesn't suck, right? But like I miss running ads. Like I run ads for my other companies like my chicken restaurants. I was going to say that's that was what I was going to ask is what how many do you publicly say that you are owner or partner in how many companies? I mean publicly I don't really talk about too many of them. I just talk about the ones that are like tangible but talking about chicken. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but but like I'm a partner in probably 12 businesses and you know, if I was to calculate the equity value of those, you know, the equity that I own in those businesses, it's probably not including bad, it's probably like $30 million of equity that I own. Yeah. Like investments I made like a million dollars that's now worth five and this one's 100 worth two. You know what I mean? Stuff like that. Yeah. That's one of the more interesting thing like I don't I mean, you're public as bad and obviously you're now doing more short form and stuff talking about that and like just how you think is there. But then when we'll talk at these dinners or something, you'll say something to me and I'm like, wait, part of what software or part of what like franchise or like, you know, digital asset, you know, as you know what I'm talking about. But like digital assets that are what, eight figures? Like crazy stuff that's that I just Yeah. I mean, I'm not privy to that, nor do I do that. I have like that limiting belief that's like the focus. And actually, it's not limiting because it's real because I have I have had an issue, but like I don't know. You've done a good job. Like I have opportunities flooding to me since I started doing this that I'm like, "Oh, I could like own 10% of that or 20 of this and like just do coaching or if I had a lean team of like the simple marketing structure style lean team or I could own a portion and like deploy and like there's layers there." But you've done clearly a good job of like doing that and actually executing on that which I think Yeah, it could be a lot better for sure. But like I I ideally invest in companies that um don't require me to do the job. They have a team internally that can do the job and then I'm basically coaching on the changes that need to be made. And that's I talked to uh so I think it was I'm trying to think of it how this played out. So I followed like Eman stuff for a really like really long time. Like I I've talked about it on here and I don't know how small he was but like OG agency days and never bought any of his stuff. Just stayed privy like the lifestyle and the growth and like he crushes it. And I ended up buying his AFL offer when it came out because I buy everyone's everything. I buy everyone's [ __ ] I'm the guru. I buy all the guru's [ __ ] I learned from and I don't guru. I don't this I mean I guess this is guruing but a different way. And uh he had talked about I had seen you going to his like educate whatever event one of those that he had out there. Yeah. That you guys went to. And it's just like when I started getting talking to him and the structure and how he does things, he I I don't we're not doxing. Email doesn't count as a dox. Uh but he was talking about somebody who does like a group coaching model with equity that makes over eight figures a year eight figures uh just doing group coaching with equity ownership. So instead of someone paying 10K or 50K for some mastermind or whatever to get coaching it the offer structure the monetization model is they get a percentage of the equities. Think like how horosing it but like just group coaching model and I'm sure there's some deploying whatever and I get the details but like crazy. So like you can do it. There is a model to do it where instead of having 40 companies and 40 onetoone calls, it's like you have four calls a month, you have 40 different founders that pop on. It's like, dude, the scale you can do it at like and we kind of talked about that in Dallas is like what could we do where we could get some cool people in the room and not even for monetization, but just to like get the right people. But yeah, it's uh there's a lot of options. There's a lot of options. So, all right, jumping. There always is. But stay focused, bro. Don't get distracted. We're we're going to be at a hundred soon. And then even what we talked about there, but I have some fun updates that I don't really talk about super public, but I think we're going to be able to take this to tens a month just with the current model on the current ham and not the back end. The back end stuff that we're talking about there is pretty big deal, too. Yeah. Yeah. So, all right. Wild stories, fails, flexes. These are always fun. I pulled this on GPT. You showed up in a tank. What does that mean? You showed up in a tank. No, it wasn't a tank. It was a sh They're called Sherpas. So they're like amphibious vehicles. They're actually used in like Ukraine a lot. It's like a really slow low gear vehicle that basically can like swim in water uh and also like climb on land and drive on a road. Uh pretty cool. How do you get your hands on one of those? What What's the uh Bro, you know Steve Harward, right? Yeah. Yeah. I can use his name. It's not a dock. Steve I mean it's Steve it's Steve's car. It's [ __ ] sick. So I went to Yeah. He I mean it's not his main car, but like he has it parked in his backyard and he just runs it every time he wants. So I I basically stayed with Steve for a few days in Utah. We did some business together and um he he he just is full of surprises, bro. This guy's the king of experiences. He took us out on it and I was like I was like, "Fuck it." And then I went to a podcast. I came out and he had like bad marketing stickered all over it and he's like, "Figured you want to shoot some ads in this thing." So Oh, that's [ __ ] dope. Yeah. He pretty much gave me the opportunity to do it and I was like, "Screw it. I'm just going to shoot some ads." Obviously came out. That is like the thing about you that is uncontested and I put this in that expose but like the connector you know everybody whether you're doing but like we've never done work together you and I have never. Yeah. And like the connections and then but like who has connected with who? Are you connecting with someone? We're talking like financing payment plans. I'm connecting with this person over here. I'm like oh who needs the agency? Like you know everybody every conference we go to every dinner every after party your own parties. Like how is that is that I mean that's just you as a person. That's not even like the business side. No, it's definitely me as a person. It's not bad. It's It's more Eddie on that side. Um, dude, I just um I always give without anything in return, which is I think a big key. And when you do that for 5 years, bro, it adds up. You know what I mean? Um, like in the agency world, at the end of the day is a service that I'm providing for people. There's so many variables. There's my team, there's their team, there's their offer, there's like a million things. Like things are going to go wrong and not everyone's going to work with us forever. And even this month, bro, I had three people leave us because they're exiting and the company's buying them for 50 million plus each of them are forcing them to have a team in house. You know what I mean? Like it's like I can't do anything about that. I'm like, dude, we did such a good job that they're now selling their you know what I mean? Phone closing or No, this was an ecom. All all these exits are in ecom. I I don't see a lot of massive I I don't see a lot of exits in the info space to be honest. Um but but yeah, point is like you know the agency side like there's going to be people that work with us that it doesn't work out for whatever reason, but I've always done good business. I've always refunded when asked to. I've like as long as it makes sense obviously. Um I've always done good business and kept good relationships and even people that don't work with us anymore still refer people to us. And so um I think just doing good in the world and you know when people need advice I give them advice all the time and help them and over time that adds to creating those connections, right? And it's reciprocated value, right? Like I've done a lot with you. I've never worked specifically together, but I'm sure if I went and asked you for a favor at this point, you'd be like, "Yeah, bro. I'm down." Like we 100%. And that's Yeah. I think what it's just I don't even know how you get the bandwidth of it. Like I'm so intro that like I love being on the invite list and I would never want to be the one who's like, you know, fully sourcing like cuz I'm like, "Oh, cool." Like I want to go to the dinners and you put the right people in the right room and do the right things in that way. And like almost those are some heavy-hitting rooms. Those are some heavy hitting rooms. Exactly. And it's like to like maintain and like foster the relationships to so like the in you know look at it I say on the channel all the time I'm like everything's a funnel but it's like the inflow of like meeting all the people the nurturing of keeping all the people the you know potential either connects or work with you or work with anyone like that takes a lot like a lot that I just am not good at. Excuse the dog over here yawning. Um but yeah that's that's that's crazy. So um all right I'm gonna jump. We're gonna go boldest and then we're gonna go dumbest thing that you've done within agency. What is the craziest [ __ ] you've ever done? I mean, boldest was naming my [ __ ] company Bad Marketing. That's got to be, you know what I mean? That's got to [ __ ] be up there, bro. Yeah. No, it's a it's a frame shift. There's no doubt. Look, I I really believe in brand. And so here here's here's kind of the logic behind it. Dude, I was getting so many referrals to our business from other clients and other people who worked with us in the past or just people that I'm connected to, let's say like you for example. And um bro, our our company name was Four Media and [ __ ] no one like the number four number four media. So the logic when I first started this company in 2017 as an LLC was like, "Oh, I'm going to have these three people be my business partners. We all have the last name M. How can I use 4M into something for media? [ __ ] it." And whatever. It's a zero revenue company, so who [ __ ] cares, right? Exactly. Um, so anyways, we split up four media and then um basically we um every time someone [ __ ] refers people to us, like we just like they'd be like, "Oh, beat Eddie from M4 4M Media 4." Like no one actually said it correctly. I'm like, "It's so [ __ ] I need something so dumb and simple that no one can ever forget the name of the company because I'm getting all these referrals and my own referrals aren't even writing the name correctly, right?" So, it was kind of like a frustrating situation. And then what happened was basically a company named for media group sent us a lawsuit because they had the rights to the name because they used it one month before us in 2017 because people were applying to their website to work for them and to work with them and they meant to apply on ours. And so I'm like if I was you guys I would have just been quiet and taken as much business and talent as possible. Exactly. It's like flipped. But yeah, they didn't think that way. They don't even exist online. Like all their stuff online is coming from us. And so I was like [ __ ] it. Let's take an opportunity. Bro, we thought of like 10,000 names. And then sarcastically my CFO was like, "Um, yeah, bro. Why don't we just name it bad marketing?" Haha. And everyone's like, "Oh, that would be so dumb and stupid." And I was like, "Nah, we're going to do that." And, um, I saw a guy that had like bad dot marketing. I'm like, "We're going to get in a lawsuit with this guy, but this name is worth a lawsuit." Um, so we basically we basically spun it up. We ran it. It was massive. Everyone knows the name now. It's way easier to remember. Like no one people used to know like Eddie Maloof. Yeah. Now they know like bad marketing. It's agreed. You know what I mean? It's Yeah. Very bold move. Could have been the worst move. This could be in the other category. I saw when you guys did the dude I have a funny story about April Fools. But when you guys did the April Fools like we're changing to good marketing or like better whatever. And that was so funny. And I honestly I was like really like that's an interesting until it took me a while. I have a funny story about that. April Fools our copywriter has been with us from like OG days. Like he writes we joke that he's like the brand face 2.0. know like he can write he like he's her he writes two emails a day every day to the main list he does all the automations he does all the scripting everything and on April Fools two years ago three years ago so we were probably doing 10ish million but we were selling info products so we had more volume of customers active customers and lead flow he sent an email out April fools that was like hey from the brand face that was like hey like this has been like so amazing to build with you all but like I'm just getting burnt out like and we're like hard energy strong like never stop whatever it I'm getting burnt out. Like I'm kind of like over this. Like we'll keep everyone in who's in and like we'll service out your contracts basically, but then we're like done. I'm going to close up shop and just like retire. Sends us out in an email and then does like line break, line break, line break, line break, line break. And then like April fools, like we're back. We're better than ever. Like we're leaning in. We're doing all this stuff. Nobody broke got past the line break. Nobody read that. Nobody scrolled. Dude, we had like it was like 1,200 customer support tickets. We have like Oh my god. We had hundreds in our Facebook community. We had like 12 actual refunds. Like we lost like tens of thousands of dollars like because they were like 12 refunds isn't bad. I thought comparison. Yeah. But like we had to have we had to go live in the community and be like can you all take a joke and like make this big joke about it about like but yeah. No, April Fools. That's that's a good one. But what is the biggest L? And then I want to go into and I feel like I maybe should have done this earlier, but we don't do podcasts around here. We're just having fun. Um but then we'll talk like literally what's working now. We'll talk just straight jam, crazy launches, who's doing not who, but like some crazy numbers you're seeing. But what's the biggest L? Um, I'd say biggest L. I mean, dude, I've had a lot of L's, but I'd say one of my biggest L's was, um, it it was like one of my biggest W's and L's back toback. So, uh, in 2020, um, here's the thing, bro. It's so funny. I I invest in like stock plays, and I hit so big on so many of them, and everyone's always like, "Oh, you should post like why your logic is behind this." So my logic is literally like my intuition of like where the industry is going. Like that's the I see post about meme coins here and there. I'm in the meme I'm in the trenches. I get it, bro. Like I see B like I don't know why everyone's in this meeting right now. I'm just you're sitting there just it's it's not even meme coins. I'm talking actual stock. You know, companies worth a lot of money and I hit big like four or five times a year I'll hit really big on on some stocks. And so in 2020, um, obviously everything crashed, COVID, whatever. And I was like, bro, there's going to be such an overupp of oil right now because no one's driving, like machines aren't working like they normally are, blah blah blah blah blah. So I basically took like 150k, took like 500 grand of margin, 400 grand of marginish, um, from Robin Hood and invested at the literally floor of oil stocks and turned my 150k cash into like 2.4 million in a year. Um, that was probably like my biggest one of my biggest dubs. And then I was like, you know what? I was gonna say, where does where's the bike? Here's the loss. Here's the loss. I was like, you know what? You're becoming too distracted, Eddie, with stocks. So, delete the app from your phone. Don't look at it and just focus on business and getting the company up. And that's where you need to be. And this should be passive. I'm like, got it. So, I did it. A stock that I invested in at like, I don't know, 20 bucks went up to 65 bucks. And then in the time that I had deleted my app went all the way down to $3 and I lost $1.7 million without having I'm like because I'm not going to check the app and get distracted. And so that was pretty brutal cuz like here's what happens. You open you open the app and you're down what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The emotional waves of seeing it. Yeah. It's not even that. You open I open the app and I was like down 500k. I'm like [ __ ] I should have been checking the app. What an idiot. Whatever. I was like whatever. I'm down. I'm not going to sell now. And then like I'm like delete the app. rechecking in two months. I'm down another 500. It just kept going and going. I was like, [ __ ] hell. So, I took an L, but then eventually I was like, I gotta make this back. So, the stock hit like $3 and I just sunk a [ __ ] ton of money into it and then it hit six and I sold it all and I was like, I recovered some of my losses, bro. Dude, take it. But not that's not Yeah, that's a big mistake. I've like played I've never played anything in in stocks really. Like kind of, but nothing of size. Memes, dude. I got we were in a lull period. We were waiting on some stuff. Honestly, like I don't know. I don't really talk about it too much, but like when we were in this like down period. Uh we were just it was kind of like a we were waiting for it to come back mode and like oh they're going to handle it versus like how we then got starting closer to January where we're like we're in we're in. I was on my way out of PR. I was like I got 0% cap gains baby. Like let's lock this thing in like day trade season. And it said it was you know 0% on cap losses. But uh I literally I started just I was serious. It was no joke probably 20 hours a day. 20 hours a day I was just in Photon and Telegram and doing all this stuff. I got I literally closed out I like basically moved around a couple hundred grand just back and forth like total it's like millions of dollars if you look at all transactions but like the total pie was whatever. I get back here I'm in normal US land normal taxes four. It was like a 40hour window. I'm like, bump 200 bucks into like 60k, bump 300 and something into like 40k. Like I clear over 100 G's in like straight profit, buy a car, like cool, all good. Move the cash out of there and then proceed to This lovely domination. That's annoying. And uh then proceed to sit and churn cash in a bucket for like 30 days and then lose it all like two soul at a time. Two soul at a time. And I'm like literally it's just like I'm sitting there when Trump drops and it's at 900 million and I'm like, "Oh, I'm not touching that [ __ ] It looks fake as I watch it go just keeps ripping 10 billion 20 billion or whatever like whatever the [ __ ] number was. It was so big. The problem is there were so many Trump coins in that second that it was kind of but like we knew the legit one. All the chats are talking about it. I got guys I know that are like oh moving money out of business accounts to get into there so they can buy it. Swapping ETH to do it and it's just like yeah it was crazy but guys made like hundreds and millions that I'm literally sitting in chats with and I'm like no I'm not going to buy it. I had like probably 200 grand sitting on the sideline that I could with two clicks I bought at subs. Stuff like that just reminds me how poor I am, bro. When these people are just flipping 30, 40 mil in like a week. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. So, all right, let's get into what's working now. Biggest stuff for us and for everyone here. And just we talked about this a little bit, but right now on the marketing front, we're running three core funnel styles. So, we're doing the main VSSL. That's how we did 70 million straight was literally one funnel, which is like dumb and funny, but very little splits. But your VSSL is interesting because you are actually the first people who um you you're actually the first people who showed me a vertical VSSL. I remember Luke showed me that two years ago and then I converted some of our funnels to a a vertical VSSL to split test and I actually increased conversion on mobile. Yeah. No, we uh we Yeah, we have 90 That's a funny thing. We have like 95 low or low 90s to 95% mobile. And the funny thing for us is we actually have a higher than normal tablet because our demo. So a lot of them will watch on tablet. So we have to like optimize for both because like generally it's desktop but like not because like our demo is the older lady who's sitting there scrolling on her iPad or whatever on the couch and then clicks through an ops. So yeah, the mobile one is crushed for us though. And we actually stole that from somebody that we saw. We had some janky software we had to use and then now we just do Vidalytics and it's like the cleanest. But yeah, so that's the VSSL opt for that which has the mobile. Now we're testing DTA thing with DT which is like for us we just call it it's direct to app direct to VSSL headline DSL and then button is right there. Interesting to hear because you guys run I mean that's what most info guys run. Headline DSL but no apps. We here here's the thing. I know now we're in the low ticket world which is something I'm trying to get really good at to be honest. Uh even for bad and that's our third funnel type that we're running right now is low ticket. Yeah. Which is the one I'm most intrigued about. Right. We were talking a lot about that at the event. It's the one that we're the least expert in, let's call it, as a whole, right? Like I don't have insane amounts of low ticket funnels that are doing seven figures a month to be honest. You know what I mean? Um that's not but you don't have an insane amount that are doing low ticket as themselves as seven figure or just not at all in like ascension because it's really I mean like we we we base it like two. It's like one you have like direct direct to cart baso which is like optimizing for AOV and breaking out and like the six upsells and all that and then you have ascension base which is like what we're running which is like you're just trying to liquidate 50 to 100 I mean ideally as much as possible but at least 50% on low ticket forcing into the high ticket and it's all about high ticket. Yeah, exactly. So that's kind of my point is everything we do is all about high ticket for the most part. I'm just trying to get the most high ticket closes possible and are we all? Are we all? Yeah, I mean not really. Some people their entire [ __ ] business I have people I talk to regularly who are doing six figures a day pure low ticket making money no high ticket back end. I'm like sounds like a dream sometimes. I'm like you're hammered. Like how are you even doing this? Like it's crazy. But um so basically yeah we don't really have too much low ticket. I've hired people recently as strategists in my team that have like come from low ticket backgrounds to help develop that side of the business and start creating more low ticket funnels as a whole. But pretty much mostly everything that we do is either lead magnet or low ticket into VSSL into high ticket sales call or webinar or challenges. Those are probably like the three highest frameworks that we use and we just gotten really good at them. Challenges are pretty damn close to a low ticket funnel in a way, right? Like I'm running ads right now, for example, for a challenge. Our challenge is $49. Our upsell is a $97 VIP and then we have another upsell for like uh basically a program of some sort. Um we're spending a decent amount a day, like five figures a day. Um and we're losing and those are live challenges, right? So that's I mean yeah, but now I'm moving to pre-recorded. So I'm like, dude, if I can just if I can I can hear you. I'm letting this dog out. I can hear you. Yeah. Cool. Cool. If I if if basically the logic is like if I can take this this technically low ticket funnel on the challenge with the upsells and turn it into a pre-recorded challenge where the dude doesn't have to show up and just evergreen it then I can be printing money every single day at a lower return. Sure. But I can be printing money and having daily sales as opposed to just like bulking them into like where we'll do like a million dollars in a day and then like everything built up to that is depending on that one day or that one person going live. And so now we're taking those winning challenges that we have. We're running the same funnels with a little bit more on the upsell side to liquidate more and then basically pushing them through to the challenge. We know our conversion rates. We know our our revenue per uh lead, let's call it on the front end, right? So I know every lead, for example, is going to make me 250 bucks. I'm willing to spend up to whatever 180 bucks to get that lead technically in the door. Um and that's minus the liquidation part, right? So, I might spend $200 to get a lead. $70 goes to liquidation. I'm actually only spending 130. I know that lead's going to make me 250 on average. And that's the game I'm trying to play right now. And so, with a lot of these offers that are pretty secure and have good challenges that we've ran, I'm just automating those into essentially a low ticket funnel that leads directly into a challenge that then sells them a mid ticket or directly to a sales call, a high ticket. I prefer mid ticket. So, they'll buy something for like two grand to five grand on the challenge and then that goes into a sales call ascension. They ascend them and we're ascending depending on the offer. The lowest one is 40%, the highest one 78%. Really? Yeah. People buying 2K upgrading to like a 10K. Interesting. Pretty good spread. Yeah, I know. Very good. I mean, ours is sub 100 for low ticket and then straight to, you know, 7 8 whatever K and that's it. There's no middle ground. There's no direct cart. There's no Yeah, but you don't need one. You're running low ticket to sales call. Yeah, correct. We're running low ticket to a setter setter call to a closer call. too close. Exactly. That's why it's not worth selling it. So, you're not going to do that with a closer. I'm trying to automate all the way to the purchase of the two to 5K and then let them take the the sales call that is someone that's already paid 2 to 5K. Yeah. The I got on with a event. I don't know if you have used them yet. Uh yeah, I hadn't heard of them and because we don't do anything like that. We don't we do no webinars at what's we've never done one. We don't do any direct to cart through that and we don't do anything even internal around that. So I went with them and that's badass. Like a lot of people are like Yeah. They're deeply integrated into a ton of different softwares. Yeah. And I think that that could be a play or the CMO uh which you met, he is big on challenges. He comes from an environment that they do a lot of challenges. But like he even says he's like, you know, it's six team members that are going 24 hours a day during like for the live version to get it live, make sure everything's there, all the like every cadence of that. And like I am not that person who wants that. I have no interest in having like these because you almost have to build a machine as you know like a machine around doing the launches for the different like challenges and events and everything could break every time and everything can break at any time. It's like we got on here. I don't have a mic right now cuz I didn't get the mic. Like that's one simple example of this little like shoot. Oh, that goes in a live challenge. You you're freaking out. The whole thing goes sideways. Exactly. Like I just don't need that. Like again we we lean too far into one funnel with the 70 mil like we are and we say we did. But like the beauty of that is we didn't have to touch a lot of things. We'd have to think like we could think about other parts of the business and we didn't and that's our fault slash my fault. But now that we learned from it, we can. But yeah, for us and I don't do you run any DTA. Yeah. So just like headline VSSL application right there. They apply through book a call. Okay. So like is that is that what DTA is? Direct. Yeah. That's what we call it. So like I've never heard someone call it DTA to be honest. Yeah. Perfect. I branded it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean most our most our stuff is DTA. Yeah. We cannot we have not gotten ours work. I mean the last six months it's been [ __ ] hard as [ __ ] for VSSLs. DTA started like a month ago. Oh yeah. Well, you're in like the worst time ever to try that because like DCA VSSLs are struggling on a CPA and ROAZ basis compared to what they were a year ago. Even two years. Yeah. We're getting like so just we optimize on purchase instead of schedule because we have never been able to get our p or our schedule cooked clean enough that it can predictably get people who show and close. So like the rorowaz on them like it can fill calendars obviously and like at a great cost but we can't get them to back out as well. Then we optimize for purchase. You need to just use that software. I'm not going to give the name here. The software that I connected you with that reads their credit and everything like you can I talk with him. You need you need to use that, bro, because then you can optimize for that because think about like think about how many leads lead to a we just we four months ago I completely agree with you. We just four months ago added uh three months ago now added a financial qualifier but it's in health and ours is like the retroactive one. So we saw that people do this and it does work for us. So we ask in there how much have you invested in your health and fitness like ever basically not what's your income, what's your future, what's your this. It's like how much have you invested and it's less than 1K 1 to5 5 to 10 10 to 20 and 20 plus the less than 1K close at blended like sub 5% sales per booking those that go to book the other one the next is 10% the next is 11 12 and like 11% on those other buckets so like we no longer pixel any of these people so it's training only on these but okay what you're saying yeah we had those guys run it through their software and they or their like their API back and forth and and lined them. And it's like this many of the less than 1K had access to 50K on their current credit cards. This bucket of these people didn't have any like it's it's very different data. Yeah. Which is what I was going to say like actually I I as an opportunist would look at it and be like, "Oh, they haven't spent any money on their health. That means the problem's actually bigger." Right. And no, I'm serious. And so there's got to be a way to convert actually a much higher percentage of these people. And that actually does make sense. And don't get me wrong, the ones who spent money on their health, duh, they're going to be an easier transaction because they've already transacted before on their health. But how I look at it is like that's a bigger problem for these other guys because they've never done it. They must be fatter. They must be more out of shape. They they must have more problems health-wise and this has to be a bigger pain point and I just have to like be able to like squeeze that painoint hard enough for it to come out. And that's why they just haven't spent money because I mean they're they're probably not in shape. No, I I mean I agree. And like I said, when I passed it through the tool, like it clear as day showed that like there are people in that bucket that have the funds and like and are exactly what you said. There are people who got to the point of wanting to book a call. They like, you know, went through the whole mental. So back to your pixel, imagine instead of like limiting the pixel to only measure purchases on a high ticket product, which are definitely like a smaller quantity, then imagine it just filtering for people that came in as a lead that have at least $50,000 as an example. And that's what I'm optimizing as an event. Now I get more than 50 of those events a week every single week on the pixel. And then that's what it's optimizing for. And the biggest issue with purchase is the time because we can do the volume. So like when we're cooking we I mean and you though it's 50 per adset. No, we can't do that. That's what I'm saying. That's the actual volume. The actual volume is 50 per week per adset. Not per account, per adset. You know what I mean? So like you might have 10 here, six here. You might have 200 across the account, but per adset. Well, that's why, and again, we talked to these guys who like somebody popped on with their thing and was like, "Oh my god, your cost per call is whatever. Let's let I'm going to say I'm going to say 400 bucks. Maybe it's half. Maybe it's three times. You guys will never know." Um, but it is it is what it is. And then it better not be three times, bro. And then you have GTA You have GTA ones that, you know, 40 bucks, 90 bucks, 180 bucks, like in that range of like way lower. Way lower. But yeah, I get I have some that are 60 70 bucks. Yeah. And like at relative scale like for Yeah. So, but but why are they so cheap? But why are they so cheap? Exactly. Is because But we now we are starting to get there where they are backing out better than way better than they were. Like literally they wouldn't even show a lot of them. We more or less fix that by doing this new qualifier thing and like seasoning it better. But I like your idea around it. The other side of it which is just like non-technical, non-data, non-marketing is like it's a colder lead. It is somebody who has had less friction, has had less consumption than somebody who opted in, had all the micro across, forced to watch a VSSL before they could apply like all like got all the emails to book, consumed free products you give them if you say the end of the bon like all these things. You don't make them watch a VSSL. The DGA right now is not right now it has the button right readily available. So the next split test I don't run any of those funnels if that's what you're asking me. I misled you. I don't run anything like that. You always do a sticky timer. I have to. I don't even I don't even show them the timer. I just don't show them the button for x amount of time. Yeah. So you just wait until the CTA in the video. Not even Yeah. Not even the CTA. At least like for example, if it's a 12minute VSSL and the CTA is at 8, I still show them the button at 56. But it's like whatever. Okay. So that's that was the split test that I wanted to launch last week was we had three of them. There were three different entire VSSLs. So, same headline, three different VSSL because we have 90 VSSLs we could test right now that we haven't run direct like this. And then the apply under it, but one of them is a clear winner. That is like, let's just say a different messaging niche pocket for us. That one won like by far. Then the next split is I want to dupe that and I want to just make the button come up in 5 minutes. And then I was talking to Kish and he's like, oh no, like let's make it when the CTA is. But that VSSL is like 31 minutes or 26 minutes. Yeah. If you do that, you'll have a massive cost per book call. Massive cost per booking. Yeah. Yeah. And because they bounce and you can't come back, which is like If anything, I would split that 30-minute VSSL, cut it down to a 12 to 15 minute VSSL and split those against each other and you'll see the actual VSSLs. Yeah. Yeah. Like you don't, bro, what do you need 30 minutes for? Dude, we're just we're just amping up the consumption. Just I don't disagree. If they want to consume educational, but you're using Yeah, you're using Vidalytics, though. So, like you can probably see the I can see I can see exactly where they dropped. I'm sure more than half the people don't make it past like 6 minutes. Not even close. That's what I'm saying. On GTA. On the GTA. Not even close. On the Oh, on a DTA. No, of course on a DTA. No chance. Yeah. But no, on the main one, it's it's pretty solid. The main one's good. Yeah. I mean, I if I was you, um I would figure out where the biggest drop off is on the main one time wise and try to make the VSSL similar to that time. Yeah. You know what I mean? Cuz now if if by if if by 7 minutes 50% is dropped off, then I can make a VSSL that's 7 minutes long, as an example, then I might be able to save 25. Yeah. What do you see as the sweet spot? You said up to 15. Like you said 10 to 12 or Yeah. Like I I I try to make my VSSLs around like 12 to 15 minutes. Yeah. Like a really short one direct will be like six to eight. Yeah. I'm a little cracked down. I'm over here and over here, but I didn't finish my thought of the other big piece of this is because that person has less consumption because of that. It requires a kind of more aggressive or just better overall sales rep. Oh, for sure. Which is something that we also have massively struggled with in the past. And now we just brought in that new CSO. He started last Thursday and since then it's like units are like our units were like this and now our units are like this. Same lead flow, same team, same like whatever. And it's just like you know it was time. Um it was time. So I mean I need someone to manage that. Yeah. I'm gonna ask offline. I'm gonna ask you offline what the final deal was. Oh yeah, deal. We can do that. We can do that. We Yeah, it's good. We're good. Uh but we did land that and we landed the one we wanted which is good. So um there'll definitely be some churn. There'll be some new reps. They're bringing in some like sickos. But that was the other big conversation point was like okay and then here's one for you around low ticket and I I was going to make a video about this and I haven't yet. So the low ticket after analyzing it with all the data and thousands of customers now we've gotten in like a testing period more or less. We're selling 30, 50, 75ish a day, right? And it scales based on spend, but then the CPA is rising. We have not rolled out the AOV boosters and the order bump or anything yet because we had to get the products created. We're all about brand quality and it being good. So, we haven't had those completed, so we can't roll them out. So, AOV is literally just conversion rate basically, right? There's like or in relation, I'm sorry, net CPA is just conversion rate. There's nothing adjusting it other than how well the media buying works and the CRO of the pages. That's it. So, it creeps up. We started doing all this analyzing. 75% of the purchasers were people who were non-new leads. No way. It was acting as like a retargeting, bro. But that's that's the that's like but that also explains why the ascension was so high. That also So like it works. It worked for a war. Not but it's not going to 300 units a day. It's not going to 500 a day. It's not going to maintain 5% ascension. Did you end up excluding them from the ads after that? Yeah. So we Well, that was the other thing is the design of the page. One was built more almost as like we were confused why it's working so well and the other one was built more for cold. This one was built more for like oh they've already heard about it. They've already heard about us. It's more on brand color. It's not their first touch. So this one converts better here. So now we have a cold focus page and one and then now we're doing an excl we're doing like the exclusion version that's going there. And in the last two days we the CPA dropped like in half last half on the cold version. So like and then now we have it going on uh Google in a good way. That's that's set up. So yesterday was 67 low ticket units. So like we're trying to press this one now and then we're doing complete ideation from the ground up and we're that'll change our whole business. It'll change our entire business. That plus this closer. I mean like it sounds obvious but you know sometimes it's not. Just the close rate going to from right now 15 to 20 to 30 plus which is like the baseline that every single sales manager we talk to is like they need to be. They're doing a 16 question application. They're watching a 25minute DSL. They're doing like all this stuff. like your close rates need to be in this range. That alone sounds obvious, but like is crazy. Cuts your CAC in half. It's the same cost to get the bookings. It's the same cost to get everything and it cuts your CAC in half. Then you change things like these unit economics and like stuff right here and you get someone on the phone for under 100 bucks that's qualified and like has the consumption. Game changer. That changes our entire business. Yeah. Like I always tell people when you're optimizing your funnel um it's someone asked me this in uh Cole Gordon's mastermind. Actually someone asked Cole and then Cole was like Eddie what do you think? I'm like [ __ ] way to put me under on the spot. Um but basically how I optimize is on the outside in. So I go okay what's the last touch point? What's the first touch point? And I'm optimizing those first. Like example if I could drop my if I can increase my conversion rate on the page by 10% on the front end how much does that affect the funnel? on the other side. If I can increase my close rate by 25%, how much does that affect the funnel? And I'm basically working in to get to the middle essentially is probably the easiest way to do it. I talk about I go through like all the funnels and how they connect and stuff on this on YouTube like all the time. And I have everything in this master one that's like optin rate to app to uh to app rate to app to booking rate to show rate is a big one that was a big issue for us for a long time. Oh, show a big dude for 12 months straight. rate was a massive issue across the Yeah, I mean it's and that's same thing. It's around the optimizing, but then all the pre-urture stuff we've rolled out. Like we rolled out a couple new things and we were talking about at that round table, but we rolled out uh Jeremy Haynes talks about a lot and I talked about him because I think his videos are great and people can go to him, but uh he has the hammer them strat, which is the basically you have a a dynamic list of people that are booked but not had their call and just sync that into Facebook and then you have all these throughplay focused videos that have no direct CTA that's like authoritative, that's pre-objection block, that's long form testimonial, it's all these things. when they watch one, it excludes them from it and shows them the other ones. And frequency is like 15 20 and you just hammer them with like you're everywhere on their feeds until they get on the phone call. And then somebody uh talked about doing that for your leads as another one that's like authoritative one to get them to book the call but not like actually directly. And that is we just rolled that a week ago and that's like going really well. Show rates are six. How big is that list though? Tiny list. I mean, the lead one's probably bigger, but the the booked but not had the call yet has to be a pretty small list. Well, we technically do booked within 48 hours, so it's uh 500, let's call it. Let's call it. Um but yeah, it could be it could be more. Yeah. So, yes, but you and then you can expand it out because you can also just go who is booked in general out and then as long as you just exclude I mean whoever you want. But people have actually been on the call. Yeah, exactly. Why am I not pulling this up? But yeah, we have show rate has been steady like this. And then now we have setters doing confirmations instead. And I think we actually might move it back to closers now that we have this new manager in who's like you need to control it. But yeah, 50 58 61 52 show rate. Uhhuh. Isn't that still kind of low? Yeah. The these last ones and then prior to that, but that's all all if you look at the setter specific one for example, they're averaging 60 I'm sorry, 74. All right, that makes more sense. Yeah, I like that ones that are claimed, but the to the total blended. So, the issue is the ones that still don't get claimed. So, that's every single booking ever. Yeah. So, like that includes cancels, no shows, resched, everything versus like true live call. So, like it's kind of buffed, but yeah, you talk about the dedicated one and it's whatever 70 mid70s still, which has been a big win. So, yeah. But all to say low ticket with Ascension, that one's basically been working for warm. Now we're going to do one for cold that's full ideation completely different offer that actually would work on cold at scale which we've never done the DTA stuff that's very interesting around the pixel. Maybe I'll just set it up with them and just rip and just try and do that. My only thing is like we've been What are you doing with the disqualified people though? What are we doing with them? Yeah, letting them book on another widget that doesn't fire the pixel. Understood. But like what are you selling them? Same thing. You don't have like a 2K 3K for the people that have never spent a dollar on fitness like why not though at your volume bro you'd be doing an extra few hundred grand a month in net profit um cuz we don't have the offer. So right now we're talking about so that's all the front end. So those three are coming in those people that get DQed if the calendars are full go to low ticket. If the calendars are not full go to the group of goes to a roundroin group of either new or like not as performing reps. top reps get top leads and all the sets also go to the top reps and then these sit here and these kind of like churn them out work their way out of the you know the trenches the once they're in then we only sell one offering then now what we're rolling out is so far talk about leaky bucket issue uh we have had no other thing to sell them other than stay at the same basically the same rate we dropped it like whatever 10% 20% uh for them to stay which also the same cost for So this is where you and I start talking about like actual like return and gross margin on these things and like yes on year two there's no more ad there's no more sales rep but there's still the fulfillment and it stays the same but you're collecting less cash so it goes up as a percentage because we haven't had any other offers. Yeah. So tomorrow is the final meeting. I've said this like three times and but it has needed to be pushed back. But Monday, we're launching a we're Monday we're launching a backend program that's only for year two people, which is closer to what you're talking about, which is like a downell. We're going to do 4K a year or 360 a month to start. Is it is it supplementation involved? No, it's group. It's the same style thing, but group coaching instead of onetoone coaching. So you still have your community, you still have your access, you still have all these other things, but you have already you're required to go through the first year in onetoone personalization because you need that to like set the baseline, get your whatever, but you need the continued access for the continued access. And instead of needing the handholding that you needed on year one, you don't need that. And then the other thing is we're going to offer batched programs or like uh longer term stuff at the coaching for discounted but more in cash collected like I mean multi-year contracts. Yeah, makes So that will that will get there. But for front end, we don't have anything different other than these same things. I have an idea on your on your back end for your DQs, but I'll tell you it offline. I don't want to say it on here. Perfect. Yeah. And then the sub stuff. Yeah. I mean, that's that's in the cards, but we're not going to do that until we're at We said five or six million a month. We're going to I'm not kidding. Same flow, same everything. We're going to double just with better set. Especially Especially with what you figured out on the cold low ticket stuff. Like that's cold low ticket stuff. And I think we'll get that DTA actually working. But that's a better closer thing. This just turned into the Ryan show and that's not the point. But yeah, so there's a lot to go there. But go back. Let's Let's pop back. Let's pop back. What is the most you've ever spent on a party or event? That's such a funny question, bro. Um, probably like half million. This is Chad GBT pulled this from from I mean that's probably half a million dollars. That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, but you know, it's it builds brand, you know. I cover a lot I cover a lot of it with sponsors sometimes. Um I uh who's like I mean I guess you don't have to name exact company names but like what type of company would sponsor other people who want because you have your client base is what it's info coaching it's ecom it's some software it's local it's no not many software it's I mean only softwares that are like really high strong lead genen right um those are those are the main points of the business we have a local and lead genen yeah yeah I mean we have a local division um that that has you know 100 plus clients let's call it, but it's not like a primary focus for me as a founder at this point just cuz they're smaller. My my time is pretty much spent on info products and big ecom brands. So, ones that are doing at least like 30, let's say 20 million a year to $100 million a year. Those are kind of the accounts that I'm focused on, they have the highest leverage and upside for us as well. Um, but for the parties where everyone wants to sponsor them, honestly, like if you if you think about the one we just had in Vegas, there was 1,200 people there and the average person in that room was doing a few million dollars a year. the average like there's people that were doing 30 40 50 I mean Tai Lopez was there Brad Lee was there Ryan Penedo was there like uh massive companies that you don't even know who they are we're doing you're doing 50 $60 million a year we're in that room and so everyone wants that list everyone wants to put their name on a party like that so um once you do it once here that's mostly an info and coaching room right like the FA that one was yeah I'll do rooms that are just ecom rooms etc right so it's kind of based on who is where um but at the end of the day dude like the first one's the hardest Um because like no one knows what it looks like. It's a prototype. You're basically asking people for favors. Hey, trust me. I'm going to throw this awesome party, whatever. Uh and then once you do the first one, everyone's like, "Oh, I've seen these or heard about them or been to them. I want to I want a piece of the action." Yeah. And then I'm able to cover it. But when I spend 400, 500K, it's usually on my own event that doesn't really have sponsors. Maybe I have like 60 80k of sponsors, but I don't sell sponsorships intentionally um just cuz I don't want them to crowd the room. Um, and then I just do it by selling ticket sales. So, we'll sell 5 10k a ticket. We'll cover our cost and I won't take a loss on it. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. We've never done We've talked about doing them for customers and I'm sure some of your clients do event I mean I know some of your clients do like events and stuff for customers whether they're included in their high ticket stuff or it's like a separate thing. Uh, we've never done it and just like again logistic stuff. It's like same thing around events. It's like do we want to add the headache and burden for what return? And when it's more brand and stuff, we have cleaned out. I would I would and I would just hire someone and pay them like I mean I got some great people. All my parties are thrown by other people and a mix of them and my team. Um but yeah, I mean I got people I can connect with, but they I got to get better at that cuz same thing with like supplements. It's like, "Oh, we don't want to do this because it needs to be really high quality and we don't want to like waste the time and focus." And it's like that is same thing I said in the beginning like limiting belief around like having partners in things or like you're breaking them off a portion or something. It's like we just did that basically with sales at like they're in house but like we broke it off at a bigger rate than we maybe would have in order to just be like handle it, right? And like being able to do that with that with events, with subs, with other stuff could be a very interesting play that dude and that's that's my business philosophy as a whole to be honest. It's like, look, I'm I'm going to have partners and I'm going to get [ __ ] by people at the end of the day. There's Yeah, that's me. Maybe that's where I'm jaded. There's a percent that I'm just going to get [ __ ] on, and that's it is what it is. But I can't do all the things I actually want to do without burning myself out or overspending too much of my cash on employees that end up screwing me over anyways at the end of the day, unless I'm able to have partners. And so, if you already have the machine, you can go to a partner who can create those supplements for you and be a partner in that. That's a way better deal for you than sitting here having to manage it all because then you have to run every initiative down the field versus like, hey, here's what I want it to look like. And then they go, they do their thing, they come back. Is this what you want, Ryan? No, I don't want that. I want this is this. Cool. Go back. Give it to you. Yes. Yes. Yes. You're just approving and giving your direction, right? And they're like, that's the key. Yeah. Because I'm finally stepping more into like my whole thing's always been like tech systems and like some opsish, but like we've tried either project managers or whatever. And like now it's finally full-fledged. like I'm running the full ops there and like at the we have we have high level leaders to where I actually it's just running them right. It's like it's orchestrating that team. It's not actually like the teams below and we're getting to the point where the band was there and that's what like my last few videos have been about is like our new ops system, our new cadence and like we've got some killers that are like fully running their own stuff but internal and like it would not be much bandwidth shift to like also we have a external or internal events, we have an external or internal subs. It's like how they have cross division that I have to figure out. But do you have to pop in one minute or you got a couple more? I got a couple more. I can go I can go like five time over. All right. Crazy story time. We talked at dinner. No doxing. No names. Biggest launch ever. What's the bit in cash? Launch. I mean, not that crazy. I've done like I mean I've been a part of launches that are way bigger, but I can't take credit for my for myself cuz I just a part. But launches myself that we've ran. I mean, four or five million in like a couple days as part of Yeah. Still, yeah, we do those internal only, but we've never had anything like new customer that we've done. Like we'll do that renewal thing that we talked about where it's discounted heavily for like the second year, which again just eats into my margin straight up. But like but it's cash flow, but like it's cash flow. Um so, but yeah, we'll do two and a half million bucks in a couple days or whatever. Yeah, that's solid. I mean, um mine mine are all new customers. Um, yeah, I'd say like 5 millionish give or take a little bit is the biggest. We've done a bunch of those. Uh, have I done like 10, 20, 30, $40 million launches? Not personally. I've been a part of launches that were like 50 million plus. Um, but I was just a part, you know what I mean? So, I can't really take credit and be like, "Oh, we did that." Um, what are the what are the biggest what are the bigger I mean I know some of the clients but like what's the biggest company that you've ran their stuff or not their name or their person but like how what kind of volume like how big is the their annual numbers in info or in ecom? I guess both. Info or ecom? Uh I mean I guess both is around 100 million. Both have been doing around close to eight figures a month. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I like not 200 million but like 100 like between 70 80 to like 120. Yeah. What does Cardone say his numbers are? Uh whatever he says they are info coaching. Oh, as far as info coaching like his sales thing like I want to I feel like it was I mean it was definitely nine figures for for the Yeah. Yeah. There's no way it's less than nine figures, bro. I have people way more than Cardone doing over $100 million a year. Um so no way it's less. And uh this was public information so I can say it. But like that's what I'm trying that's what I'm trying to navigate right now too. I'm like where Yeah. Yeah. What I what I can also say public information is like you just for context Cardone even owned like 10X Health. 10X Health. Um Gary was talking about on one of his podcasts, but he went on the Joe Rogan show and they did I forgot the exact number he publicized, but uh you know, multiple eight figures worth of sales of just front-end lab tests in a matter of like a couple weeks, right? Um that's just front end lab test, not even the back end. And that's just I was one of them. I was one of them. So was Luke, you know? So that that's and that's like a fragment of the pie, you know what I mean? So, like I don't know. That stuff's crazy because you hear I would doubt that Cardone's doing between those kind of services and stuff like that. I would not doubt if he's doing like half a billion dollars a year. Yeah, I feel like his number was close to that. He cuz he talks about it sometimes and again, I don't know what he shares or doesn't, but there's other guys that are huge in the space that I know you have run for or currently run for that I'm like so curious. Like I know guys that are direct in our like our specific bucket of TAM you could call it that do hundreds and a major like and it's the full-fledged machine is what we're talking about that do hundreds of millions in our world. That's why I can think of one. I know people who do the exact like model of low ticket or like direct to cart that it's that's in info coaching. I know two off the top that are like 10 to 15 a month. Like that's just who I know. And then you we were talking to dinner, you're like, "Oh yeah, I know four more that you didn't even say." And it's like there are people cooking and there's people in my DMs. That guy, I mean, there's one that crushed he was the one he was the one who connected me with the two of the four people I did sales interviews for just because he watched the videos. He said, "Hey, everyone on my team is watching your videos and whatever." And they did 31 last year in info and I've never even heard of them. Yeah. You don't even know who they are. Yeah. There's so many people like that, bro. So many people. And the other thing, oh my god, actually I have to share this. There's a guy that does almost no paid whatsoever, almost all organic and they are so their margin because a lot of the time someone let's just like easy math someone's operating at like a three, right? So like 30% of it. So for us if our numbers are 30% margin on like a healthy whatever because so much paid the organic guys get like into the 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And like Ian publicly said his in a video. He's like, "Oh, I did 70% on 70 million." And it's like, you know, we did 70 million and we did not do 70%. Let me be very clear. And that 10 to 30 was a massive decrease. Dollars went up, but percentage went down. Yeah, percentage definitely goes down. Even us like and that was and I even take blame for that. Like we got fat and happy everywhere in acquisition, whatever. But so these guys are talking about it and they have this niche business that is in like uh in training like a sports niche and it's a little bit in person if you want as like this higher thing because they have an office and people come out but almost all of it's remote and they are doing size. They're doing seven figures a month right now. They have zero paid. Zero. Like you you should do their comp structures for their sales reps. They're such layups that they're like not even percents. You just get like a little chunk. They sell everyone on like monthly instead of piffs. There's no there's no incentivizing pips or whatever. The PIFF is the same price as the monthly as the monthly in-house payland. And I I get on a call with these guys and they're just badasses. Like they just have a good product. And like that was on your thing that this pulled for me. It is best marketing strategy is a great product. And this is something that you're quoted saying and it's like these guys crush and I actually want to talk to you about this offline because I you I might need to get you connected with them because they have zero paid and no setup and their backend monetization model is like entering stratosphere like similar to how uh I've run it for like life insurance guys that was info. They sell a 10K thing teaching all this stuff about like taxation and and and retirement and whatever and then inside it you use this asset and it's uh whole life insurance and then they make money as an insurance rep. Like think like that type of backend [ __ ] but bigger. Like there are some plays in this market that you can make. So yeah, I don't know. I mean do you see yourself where do you see what is it May? Now you're trying to decrease team count. Decrease your team count. Yes. Uh through what I'm actually doing, what I'm actually doing is decreasing the percentage of clients that I do business for for them and increasing the percentages that I do business for us, if that makes sense. Interesting. So like I'm launching our own offers and have already launched their own offers that no one knows I'm behind and no one will ever know I'm behind. Some of them they will, but most of them they won't know I'm behind. And I'm like, "Dude, why don't I just take like my talents and be able to do that for myself as well, bro?" Because here's a here's a sad part in the agency space is I was telling this to my partners like a month ago. I was like, "Dude, like we got into business to not get fired by a boss yet [ __ ] at the scale that we're at, we get fired every week." Yeah. You have hundreds of bosses. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, so I'm like, "What the [ __ ] are we doing?" Instead, you want thousands of bosses through customers instead. I mean, bro, I'd rather I'd rather take those customers who are like four degrees of separation away from me than the people who I actually talk to and care about and have direct relationships with. And don't no one that I actually talk to directly I have a bad relationship with. Even if we don't work out as a business because of the character that I have and the team and everything like we people who know us know what we do, right? We're not going to work for everyone. At the end of the day, it happens. 200 humans working for me, they're going to make [ __ ] mistakes. It's going to happen, right? But like if I could just control it and rip 10 million on an offer myself on, you know, 5 million net and keep that for myself instead of, you know, taking a small piece and a retainer from a client. I can do that way easier and I don't have to sit here bottleneck by the client now giving me content and all this other stuff. You know what I mean? So, I'm always going to take on clients because it's a great way to also diversify skill set. Like, I'm touching so many different funnels. I'm building so many different businesses. like it's very hard to replicate that even if I run my own offers. Um, and we do a good job and I have a great team and I don't want to let my team go, right? But over time, I'm going to transition, you know, instead of uh 2% being our stuff, it'll maybe end up being 30% our stuff, 70% client. So, we're just like a lot pickier with who we work with as a whole. Yeah. Cash flowing from there and then build. Yeah. I mean, that's that's the Craig Clemens, I think his name is model, right? With the uh what's that called? Golden Hippo. Golden. Yeah. Cuz he does that for ecom. So he I think the public one he says he's behind is Gundry but a bunch of others and it's just like you go to their website it's just all about hiring and people and whatever and they run whale ecom businesses and they just run the whole thing a toz and the whole thing just direct response like he has a video talking about how he created uh uh prebiotics like he created the word prebiotic like probiotic was a thing I think it was and he created it through VSSL that was so info and so well done that it was just like on YouTube normal and like Rogan put it on his podcast like oh you guys got to watch this and it was a VSSL. That's crazy. Goes hard. So, if you have that skill set and it's what we talked about at dinner and what we continue to talk about is like at a certain point, how fun would it be to do that? And you have the opportunity to because you're in there. But like for us right now, it's like we could incubate and try and do this, but it's like our TAM is so big. We are so small. Like just lean into what we have here. Distract your own offers. It would distract our own offers to do it. And that was the thing Luke talked about. I was like, "Oh, and like we almost did it, we're doing it almost now internal through other faces that'll have different like front-end offers and messaging that then can all funnel to the same back end." Yeah. So, it's just like a a zoomed in version of that. So, um, all right, that's basically all I had on here, but last one, advice to guys, internal versus agency, and pros and cons. and you can be quick with it because I'm sure you got a pop. Um, I mean, think about someone who's like smaller than maybe us. So, think of somebody who because a lot of people are and they get stuck. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. I mean, the pros are pretty obvious. Pros are the agency works with a ton of different accounts. They are they have the answers faster than someone you're going to hire internal. Um, let's just be real. Like, what media buyer are how much do you have to pay a media buyer that's actually spending $5 million, $10 million a month to come work for you full-time? It's [ __ ] impossible. You're going to pay them more than you're going to pay an agency. And quite frankly, that person doesn't need to be media buying for 40 hours a week. You know what I mean? It's just not a realistic scenario. So, uh I at certain levels, I would rather it take skill and the ability to have an entire team working for me for the price of like one person over having one person. Now, you get to a certain point where you have to start layering over the agency. So you need to get a marketing director internally probably at like 2 to 3 million a month where the internal marketing director oversees all the agency relationships and then slowly you can start bringing more people in house to do those roles. But like quite frankly, bro, like I mean like for example me, like I'm unhirable, right? Most people that are of this caliber of of talent and skill are also unhirable, right? They run their own agencies, they work for other agencies cuz the upside is bigger. And if someone works for me in an agency, I can give him five, six accounts and he can take home some significant money. If he works for one company, they're never going to be able to pay him what I'm going to be able to pay him because I'm working with six, right? Um so the advantages are there early on. I think um roles that are um more volatile, let's call it like ads and stuff like that at scale, you start bringing people inhouse because the agency guy is not going to spend 40 hours a week on your account, but you'll start needing someone to do so. But if you're doing um you know 5 million a year, 10 million a year, 20 million a year even um I I don't think it's really necessary to build that stuff in house. It's way easier um to do it externally. That being said, you obviously carry risk. you hire the wrong agency or you get the wrong media buyer. Um, you know, there is a risk to that. The upside on that same risk though is if it's an agency, let's say mine, you get a media buyer. Oh, this guy's not a good fit for the account. I got six more that are savages that are also spending money. Maybe I put two more on the account, see which one comes out on top. How much time internally if your media buyer [ __ ] you would it take to get unwind that. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? So, whereas like in an agency, I could be like, take them off, put these two people on, see which one runs it better, and let's take it from there. So there's pros and cons to each. I'm obviously biased. I run an agency. All my businesses pay my agency to run their marketing. So like I believe in it, you know what I mean? I believe in that concept. If I had to build an internal marketing team for every business, they would get cooked financially, you know what I mean? Yeah. No, no. Real. Yeah. I mean, and I've shared on here our journey of that, but what we I mean, Luke's spent up to 20 a day or whatever for a while for us and like up until that scale. Then we tried to do the in-house guys. We had like lead genen style people that were contractors. just they only had like one or two other clients, not agencies, but like whatever they were buying for us. Then we tried full agency. We had some that were like infospecific that we were paying based on net of like new cash minus ad expense basically like a spread and doing a percentage of that for a minute and then those guys got us up to big numbers but then CPA was slipping. They weren't as focused. There was no detail. It was like kind of just a relationship. And now now I think you work with one of my uh ex team members, right? Who does buying? Yeah. So now well then we moved to another agency because we're like oh it's creative. We need more output. We were paying I want to say 13% of ad spend. Yeah. And the CPA was increasing the entire time. So we were getting railed. I mean we were spending a million bucks a month. We were paying them 130 grand a month for ours with no contingency, no CPA, no targets, no KPIs, like just percent. Got railed and then we went back in house. Now we have CMO. We have Yes. Our our media buyers are contractors that have multiple clients. So like you kind of call it agency. Um but yeah. So cool. All right. Always good. offline about some of the backend stuff. I think it's uh I think you should consider I'll text you offline this weekend about some backend stuff. Okay. Where's our next event? Where are we going? You pick. I'll be there. Dubai with all only 18. It's your turn to pick. Not me. That's what we're doing. We're I'll create something where we can just have a group chat a bunch of info and we can take them all to Dubai. Bro, I'm down. As long as I don't have to go to Philadelphia, please. Yeah, we're not going to Philly. No. Luke makes us go to Philly, but that's just for just executive retreats. Never, bro. Please. Cool, bro. All right. Everyone knows where to find you. Everyone already knows who you are. But this was good. I appreciate you and we will talk soon. Peace.

# ClickUp + Slack = Our $100M Stack... (Breakdown) | EP63
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcnD53DOiMg

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how to build your execution engine, which in short term just means how to build your lean project management system that does not get in the way and focuses on execution. We're going to go through the big idea and what most people get wrong on this, the core tools that most people use and what we are actually using, the cadence that how to roll this out and then go into the deep dive of the detailed structure we're using on how to manage projects across many divisions all very simply that does not get in the way and things to avoid. All right, this is going to be a good one. Last year, we did 30.5 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 30 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you everything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a cool network of people building cool So, let's get into it. Switched up the color on you guys today after 63 days. It's feeling crazy. So, big idea here. Most of these systems, project management systems, how you manage your projects, how you manage your tasks across divisions and across people in your company, have too many layers. They often have multiple owners. They have no consistent rhythm. They definitely do not get held to a standardized deadlines. And a lot of the time, it ends up being busy work. So, you all know what I'm talking about when we start to talk about you want to launch a new initiative, whether it's a small project or a massive project. Too many chefs in the kitchen, no one clear owner, and it is hard to manage. You try to hire a project manager, you try to hire a COO, someone, they implement all these systems that slow you down. And that is not the goal here. So, we built a lean one. This is real-time building. I will be able to actively update you on how this goes for us and how it evolves. This is V1, which is actually like V6 of us doing this. But I'm in control of it now. And this is how I just built it. So, core tools a lot of people use, ClickUp, Asana, Notion, Air Table, Slack, etc. The ones we have chosen to use is the companies on ClickUp. I'm actually a really big fan of Air Table, but that's just kind of how I think. It's like a spreadsheet more or less. Uh and then Slack for dedicated projects uh or for dedicated channels around projects that are large that need communication around them uh as well as meetings around those. So the cadence for us, I went over this in another uh meet another video one or two ago that talks about how we're going to focus on cross functional and department focused. This is the actual meeting cadence. So the board uh the lists and all that actually operate in this and so do the meetings. So for us, we're going to have a meeting early in the week that is our operations meeting that we've always had and is now going to be focused only on cross functional. So it is going to be higher leverage things. It is going to be projects and initiatives that are companywide that are higher leverage as you have your entire seuite, your highest operating level people. Now this is the scale we are at. Uh at another level I would almost say that cross functional is kind of all of them and you can determine when you need this but we are to a phase and stage where we do need this multiple layers. So cross functional you're going to talk about projects that are all-encompassing. Think about an entire project launch or I'm sorry another a new offering launch. It needs marketing. It needs tech. It needs fulfillment. It needs sale. Like it needs everything. So those will be decided here. They will be talked about, decided and the owners will be assigned out and the sub projects will be department focus. This is going to be something that is like tech for tech, marketing for marketing. Things that do not need to be talked about and wasted of time across all divisions in a cross functional meeting. You do not need to talk deep in depth about low ticket for 30 minutes of an hourong meeting when you have four other people in the room that yes it affects on a company level but not in terms of what they need to do in the project in the decision-m process any of that. So here's how we are rocking. We're going to have one master list and don't think about this like one to-do list but actually one like fullyfledged relational list. Okay? So you're going to have one source of truth and think in like terms of a waterfall and then having subcategories. So there Sharin was a really good one. So look up his stuff. He's had a bunch of good stuff. I don't know if he still sells his but his was essentially going from annual goal to quarterly goal. And these are waterfall is what I mean by this. From quarterly goal then to the monthlies and weekly breakdowns of how they get there. And all it's basically your KPIs as well as the projects are flowing through. So think let's say you want to launch low ticket uh or you want to sell 4,000 low tickets in Q1. Okay. So what needs to happen now in Q1 broken across the months. You need to launch low ticket. You need to uh uh do ideation around the low ticket. You need to do all these different things. You need to go live with it. You need to have setters on the back end. You need sales. You need to have fulfillment on there and CS and supporting. You need the community manager. Like you have the all these pieces and those all get fledged out across those departments. Now how we're doing it in even more in a leaner way. This is our t our task setup. So, one master board and then think left to right. Okay, almost like a spreadsheet but more advanced. You're going to have your project name. It's going to then have a status. It's going to be either open, meaning it's like in the parking lot, an idea, something that we are going to handle but aren't handling yet. And this is the portion that we are going to like talk about during the meetings in cross and in department. Once it is assigned out and it is set to a to-do, it gets a due date and it gets an owner. Okay. Once it's then in progress, this is kind of like multi-week projects. Um, so if you're going to have it, for example, if you're going to have something that's going to last two or three weeks, on that meeting, you need to have it that it's in progress, that it is being done and being worked on, but only moved into there when it is. Um, and then things like, you know, it needs to be done by next day. Those are to-do all the way to completed. Blocked that is occasionally going to happen, and that is when something is stuck uh due to some dependency or some macro change that happens. An example of this is we were going to order merchandise and swag for something. We got it all signed up all basically over the finish line. We're right there. We're about to order and we're like, we just don't need this right now. This is not something that's needle moving. It is a distraction. It is not going to help us right now. So, we just put it in blocked and it'll sit there until every meeting will will quickly cover. Are we ready for this? No, not yet. Okay. Throw a future due date on this and let it sit. Completed is when it is done. Now, again, these will all then have a due date, a submitter, so who submitted it. So, a lot of the time I will submit ideas that I either hear other places or someone says. If I hear someone specifically say it, I will put them as the submitter. And then the champion is who is going to own it. It then falls into a department bucket for us. I have it pulled up over here. The core ones for us right now are marketing, sales, tech, product, and CS. Those are in one because it's kind of for us they're batched together. Finance, and then personnel. Okay. Now, I combine some of these because of how our hierarchy is and who we have as leaders. But you could break these out further or you could also make them a little bit simpler and and batch together. Like I know people who do acquisition for example and that's sales and marketing. Um I know people who include tech and and uh personnel they'll put inside like CS like there there's a lot of different ways you can do this but make it unique to you. And then type for type all you're going to do is for us we're going to do either cross sync or department sync. And what that does is allows you to then create all your filtered customized views using one master list that is applicable just for those departments. So, an example of this, and here's an actual visual of what this will look like on here, right? So, you're going to have your project name. So, in this, you're going to have a renewal offer design. Let's say you're going to have that marked as open because it hasn't been assigned yet. Once it gets assigned to to-do, it'll then get a due date. I was the one who submitted it because I wanted to bring it to the table and have everyone talk about it. The CPO is assigned it because that they are in charge of this renewal offer basically, but it is then and it's a product in CS, but it's a cross sync because it's a renewal offer. It's a complete offer. It's going to need sales scripts. It's going to need tech built around it if it's, you know, for this it's renewal. It's on a back end. So, you need entire tech systems and tracking. It's going to need marketing on how we going to actually create the language around it, the copy, the um any of the assets you need. It's going to include CS. How is the entire fulfillment or I'm sorry, fulfillment and CS, how is it going to have that entire department actually fulfilled on and the group and what what different things they give and like levels of service. So all that all of that would sit in cross sync and then from there it would have projects that break down under it. Now you can choose to either do this as subtasks or tasks under it directly uh or additional tasks I'm sorry and then you would assign those out as department level ones. Okay. So an example I'm looking over here because where I have ours I can't share ours just because I have like I already have 300 and something across every department or across the all and then each department is broken down. So for us I have the all table so I can see everything in one place. I then have a cross table that is only going it's going to have everything that only has cross sync. So these are the things in to-do open I'm sorry to-do in progress open that we will cover on our Tuesday cross sync with all the important leaders all in one place. things like doing a giveaway promo, things like building an entire platform, things like LTV brainstorm sessions, things like companywide chat GPT training, things like qualifying tools, we're talking about using things like changes to sales calls. We're talking like those are bigger things that affect multiple divisions and we need to decide those as a company in one place and those will be cross sync. Okay. Now, the next tab you're going to have on top of there, these are all views of the same data set. Okay. All views the same data set just filtered in different ways. The next one is going to be department specific and that is going to be for for us sales I'm sorry in order tech fulfillment sales marketing. Okay, in that order and that's how we're going to run our meetings. So that's how these are uh filtered across here. And each one of those will have its own to-do in progress I'm sorry in progress to-do open lists and those will be handled in those meetings specific. Now, who avoid who is on these meetings? Right now, it's going to be me and CEO and then is going to be the department lead. It may branch down into having other people in it. But the big benefits of doing this is you will have public visibility. Anyone can click on these different boards and see there's nothing sensitive across here. Nor is there anything sensitive across this level of leadership that we would not share. You're going to have one dedicated owner. There's one person that's responsible for it with a direct deadline and a due date. We have a culture and we have had one that got a little slippery on terms of like oh yeah and then it next this Friday, next Friday and I already said that in a prior video like my big concern on this is our meetings are Tuesday and Thursday. So easily for someone Thursday to be like oh have it be done by next meeting which is the following Tuesday and I'm going to like nip that nip that immediately in the front because that is not cool. We need to have a standardized culture of the champion knows that the due date is when the due date is and we get things done within those or before them. Okay, so that is like a big thing. We're going to have public visibility around that. We're going to have dashboards around that on who the owners are and what their completion rates are. And we're going to focus on outcome over effort. I have a I guess is part of the avoid thing, but I have we have hired two project managers now in the past, both great people. First time we hired a project manager, well, if I go back even further, when we initially hired uh or bought a course that was around this, we were doing like 150 grand a month and we just felt scattered, maybe less, 100 grand a month. We felt so scattered and we're like, "Oh, we need to buy this thing. We need like ops. we need like structure and project management and like I wasn't in a position where I was had skill level or understanding or whatever to do it necessarily and I also was kind of in this mind of like oh we just hire and fix it unless it was years ago and that was wrong. Um I've now come to a realization that I like to get into things and then hire for them kind of after the fact a little bit uh or hire someone who's extremely experienced and again we did not have the skill level to hire them. We did not have the brand authority to hire someone. We did not have the money to hire somebody at that time. So we paid for a course or like a training thing and it was just too early. We did not need systems and structure. It added too much layer and complexity and actually made it harder to get things done and mark them off and like run the system. It was harder to run the system than it was to just get  done, right? So that is like what still what we're avoiding. And then the next time we did it, sameish thing like just coming in and trying to like think of it in this tech mind and do they call it like scrum lists for tech side of things and they're like trying to build out this and this and once it gets into here it goes into review stage and once it's in a review stage it's live and then it's monitoring and whatever and like that has its place for things like tech that has its place for things like marketing does not necessarily have its place for these cross department ones and even then it doesn't right because you have one time you have recurrent projects kind of going on a tangent but like they have different cadences and they do not need to be like beat to death in a project management tool always at scale yes like you need a system you need a structure you need it operating in that way but for these kind of leaner team decisions and I think I'm sure over time I'll change this and this is to get us you know to 50 or 100 a year and then from there I'm sure I will hire in somebody to kind of like fill in behind this I'll have the conversations and stuff and they will actually operate the boards and I'm sure they'll clean this up they'll make dependencies they'll do all these things but for us right now and probably for a lot of people who would be listening to This this is clean and simple enough to get you great profit and great scale and get projects done because the projects getting done are what get you the profit and the scale. Okay, so public visibility one owner and outcomes over effort, not just making this busy. So this helps you avoid the no deadline BS which we already are having in the system that was prior to this where it's like oh just bump it to the next week, bump it to the next week, no conflict, no priority, that's another one on here. So we are going to use for priorities we're going to do it by due date. So you there are priority fields you can rank them this is the highest is the lowest is whatever for us we're going to do it by due date and then there's calendar views there gant views where things are in order in that way things will get bumped something that'll be due what's today Wednesday things will be due tomorrow we'll go to do them and we'll have something that's like an absolute fire that needs to be done immediately I already have one example and it's not even like a fire but it needs to be done sooner than the other projects so the other ones will get moved to Friday and that one will get moved to there to to tomorrow so it's like we're going to use this in order of doing that and you'll always know. And then there's a date created field actually over here. So you can see when these were created and when they were completed so you have a time from creation to completion. Um but the prioritization has been a huge issue and it no longer will be ideally too many tools. People string together all these tools. They use a spreadsheet for this. They use notion for this. They use ClickUp for this. They use their own datab whatever for this. We're simplifying. Okay. Okay, so the main two tools we are using, like I said here, we're going to have ClickUp and then when we have larger things, we create a dedicated Slack channel that is project based until completion and then we close it. Okay, and that is a big one. We've tried to do just like drop it in a thread and just get it done. That's okay for like mini projects, but when it's fully fledged project, it's not okay. Does not work. It you'll have 150 messages in a thread. Someone will send outside of there, then you'll be in two channel. It just gets soing messy. It's like stupid. So we are going to do a dedicated slack channel. An example of this is like comp overhaul. It's like we want to do a comp overhaul for whatever CS call it. Let's just say an example. We are going to put a dedicated channel around that. We need all the data sent into there. We're going back and forth. It's a bigger project because it affects this and this. While we're talking about that or that's a bad example. It's an entire comp overhaul, not just one department. So it's like I want all the data. I want all the numbers. I want where everyone sits. I want the feedback request forms. I want all that data inside of there. And we're communicating back and forth, back and forth. We're hopping on a meeting that we're setting to go over the data and make decisions. We're going a roll out. We're having the rollout conversation in there. Like it's a fullyfledged thing that needs communication as well as the project and it'll have the subtasks within it to complete them. Overanalyzing happens way too much. That was just what I was talking about here where it's like it's kind of the same as project bloat. You get to a point where you just have so many things that are like dependent on this and this and it's like once you do this then you can do this and then you can do this and then it's like it just it breaks and then you set up automations that create things that are recurring because they're oneoff here but then they're recurring here and it's like it's just too much. So we are going in this method and model. I hope this is helpful to you. You can do this in a sheet if you're super lean and mean but like ClickUp is easy. Asana I've heard actually great great things about but we're here now. I love Dair Table. All of them do the same thing. Doesn't matter what tool you use. all of them do the same thing. I can't show you ours just I mean I basically just did I just created test items to show you ours. Um but yeah, so I hope this was helpful and I hope this is this is just again all these videos I'm this is what I did today. This is a large portion of what I did this entire morning was building this out and then actually migrating everything over from like one-off lists and all this because it was everywhere and now it's all in one place. So I figured again as usual I will talk about what we're doing now to scale. Okay. And this is going to be a very key point because marketing is having things, fulfillment is having things with multiple offers. Sales has new complete leadership and they have like, oh, I want to change this and these slide decks and these scripts and these whatever. It's like we need a list. We need to prioritize. We need to work through them and we need a cadence of meeting and going through these. So, that's where we're at. We're doing okay in terms of cash. Uh, we did what 80 something. We're we're in the right direction. Let's just say that. So, I'll do another monthly update. We'll say the 14th. I'll do another monthly update, but we're going to beat last month for sure. Um, but there's going to be a growth curve. I think I said that in yesterday's video, but there's going to be a growth curve to get this back on to where it needs to be. Um, we came up with some stuff around marketing and we're doing like a complete groundup launch on some cool new things. I can do a dedicated video around that and our theory behind it. Uh, we found some new stuff in VSSLs. We found we shot some new brand face stuff. So, we have like complete diversification there with multiple there. Uh, brand face, multiple page dog is yawning. Um, but yeah, so all the videos will be here. www.ryanclog.comdoc. On the top of this, there's also a request form. Once a week, I go through and answer all your guys' questions live on here. I think I've done two or three of those so far. Um, so feel free to ask questions inside the request form, which is just this, I believe. Just request and you guys can ask questions there. And yeah, that's what I got. All these sorted by tech, marketing, sales, ops, all the things. Follow me on IG and talk there is probably the best one. and then X2. It's just a little harder to keep up on communication in there, I found. Uh, I appreciate you guys. I think today's 63 in a row. So, cooking along and I'm excited to have these videos. I don't know when I'm going to stop, but uh I'm excited to have these videos where this is over 100 on total and then where my trailing is 100 as well. So, we're going to get there and we're going to do live. So talk soon you guys.

# how to SCALE your team w/o killing PROFIT... (real math) | EP62
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6Q11qYppUE

In today's video, we're going to get tactical and talk about calculating ROI of your team. The best teams feel aligned, paid, and clear on how their role moves the business. So, we're going to break down how to do that. Today, we're going to go through sales, do a model on how to calculate return on rep multiples, and how you can automate this in your business. Go through marketing, fulfillment, and everything we did wrong. We have overpaid, we have misaligned KPIs. We have done everything you can do wrong. Uh, and I'm going to share it all with you today. So, if your team wins but your margin dies, you don't you didn't build comp, you built a chaos machine. And we're going to get into that. So, last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We just crossed over 73 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is share what did work, didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people building cool All right, so let's get into it. Now, aligned, paid, and clear on how their role moves the business. This does not necessarily just mean monetary. I am numbers. I like numbers. But it would be foolish to say that it is just how much they get paid or how they are paid that is why someone works in a business. Why someone is a part of a team. Okay. So clear preface there. Core idea. You need to look at this as an investment not an expense. When you do ROI, you're doing return on investment. When you are doing rorowaz, you're doing return on ad spend. When you are doing team, you are doing return on team. Okay? There are some positions and parts of your team that are easier to quantify this as and saying uh a sales rep, you know, calls 20 G's and makes you a hundred commissionbased specific. There are harder ones to do like a CS rep or someone that sits in like an operational role, but it you can still do that. And the biggest thing is you can tie them to KPIs that drive the right behaviors that do drive the margin and control that. Okay, so almost everyone is going to be paid on base plus performance. And there is a difference between being aligned and being paid. Okay, there's a big difference right here. Aligned, paid, big difference. So sales, we are actually changing this up relatively soon. We just brought in a whole new system uh manager into here. So tier base as of now. A lot of the time this is how they run. So they're going to be based on sales per booking as like a blended metric. They're going to be based on close rate. They're going to be based on cash collected. And an example of this and how it would look in tiers is let's say it's 100k, 200k and 300k in cash collected. Someone will collect uh if they are under the 100k they'll get 7%. If someone is between 100 and 200 they will get 9% and if they are over 200k to 300k or whatever the math I just said they will get a higher percent. So what that is incentivizing is it it is it is incentivizing them to push more volume and do more cash collected in that given range. generally a pay period. So either two weeks or four weeks. Now the other thing you always want to protect yourself with is clawbacks. And then let's get into some return on rep because I think this is fun. So let's say you have a rep that is doing 150,000 in new cash collected. Okay. Now refunds on that are going to be call it 10 grand. All right. So they have 150k that they collected. 10k they just pushed them over the line. the person refunded within the first day, two days, whatever. And so your net new cash collect is 140 gs. We're going to assume we're going to pay them a 10% commission because they hit whatever threshold. We're going to say they have to get 150. Yeah, let's leave it at 90 bookings. And then for the booking cost, let's say that those bookings cost $350 per. You have a higher ticket offer. Okay. So, three uh $31,000500 in booking cost. Now, your total cost is now going to be the commission that you paid them and the booking cost, right? Because you just spent $31,000 in bookings and you paid them $14,000. So, your total cost is $45,000. Now, your net dollars that the company then brought in is going to be $94,500, which is the net new cash. So, all your new cash minus your refunds gets your net new cash minus what you just paid in cost, which is your booking cost and your commission cost. Okay? So, now you have this $94,000 number. And then what you can do is get a net multiple of this, which is you can do this multiple ways. I've seen people do it. But what so you spent $45,500 to make to make to like keep 94,000 at the next layer of the P&L. Okay. The other option on how to do this is to look at this instead as how much total cash did they bring in instead of what net did they bring in. So 94,000 versus this net new cash which would give you this. Okay. So and you can call this net grow. I mean you can change how these are actually called but let's just call it uh RO multiple. Now, cool thing that you can do is have this formula set built into all of your sales reps across your grid. So, you can see because the big difference here is going to happen is someone's going to have really good cash collected and in comparison to someone else, but they are not going to they're one's going to have three times the amount of bookings than the other person. So someone else is more efficient with their bookings and technically is making the company has a higher return on rep multiple than someone else because the other person is taking three times as many calls to get the same amount of cash collected than this person. So this is kind of like a true north number. We've used it for a long time and for a long time we actually called it calendar rating because we didn't want to like jam numbers and like net like how much you made the company which is not even close to true because then it hits you if you've seen any of my other videos that then hits the fulfillment side. it hits I mean this kind this includes the ad cost in it but it does not include fulfillment doesn't include anything on overhead doesn't include anything on anywhere else and a lot of the time people misconstrue that for it's like oh the company just made 94 grand it's like no the company did not make 94 grand um but yeah so important piece now we call the calendar rating in our new era of where we're going with sales and being more clear I think we are going to call it RO and return on rep so we'll see there but that's essentially a very very good number and it'll auto update real time depending on your dashboard so maybe I'll better videos on this, but like cash flow trackers and then uh like sales trackers, marketing trackers, because ours all all combined and like weave in and out of each other, so they're all using the same data. Um, but yeah, you can have this live updating across ranges and then you can look across 14, 30, 60-day ranges and then also adjust your availability and your ranking of your booking widgets so that the top reps based on return on rep are getting the most amount of bookings or the highest quality bookings. So instead of just cash collected, instead of just this, you can choose to optimize for whatever. Now, management, management to exact. Oh, so management to exact. We have done this way wrong in the past, but we now have management all directly tied to their exact KPI. So you're going to have sales manager, you're going to have a setter manager, closer manager, let's just call it both those are assigned to their buckets. Very important. So a closer manager is it gets uh KPI completely based on net new cash that is accepted. So like just the new portion of it and then setter is net new cash that's from setters. Okay. So both those are aligned in that way. I can't even tell you how many times we've picked up comp and done it the wrong way. And then another thing I do that I can't really show and I almost showed it but is I model everything together. So I have a master spreadsheet in sales that is like everything you can imagine. So it goes down by cash collected here. New cash collected net new net new cash collected. So call it 1 2 5 10 whatever million a month. Then it has all of their it has the manager of closer. It has the manager of setter. It has all the closers. Then it has all the setters. And then it has the different throttles all over here. So like uh certain managers make bases. The sales team uh has their uh thresholds for where they're at W2 and then they cross over a draw versus a base. I have other videos talking about this. This is kind of more of a collective one, but um I'm busy as so I'm just yapping about this today. But the uh the model basically will break it down and then give you a total percentage of how much the sales team, the overarching entire sales department, management, closers, setters, everything is as a blended percentage of net new rev at these numbers. And it's like pretty exact. Okay, so like I even bake in W2, so it's like, you know, add the whatever 20%. I just blend it and say 20%. Um but yeah, so that's what we're optimizing for. So this comp plan entirely is changing and incentivizing the right behaviors. So back to this aligned culturally paid well and clear though on how that KPI they're driving for affects the business and affects their paycheck. Okay. So I model everything together and that's been very very helpful for us into this next era and phase marketing. We do we are now building new budgets and everything is based on a percentage of new rev. So basically saying I don't want to three call it 3% 5%. So if the company is doing a million dollars in new re new cash new cash big difference new cash a month we are targeting 50k in basically comp that goes out to the marketing team. Now, in the beginning for us, it's going to be a little bit higher because we're basically stop like staffing that up for where we're currently at into this next era and then it will it will not move in the same way. We're just trying to keep it under this range so that we can model things into the future. So, almost everybody is paid as a base plus KPI. Things that for KPIs that we have used and are using right now are things like CAC plus volume. Almost everything is a pairing metric for this. So call it CAC under a thousand, but you also must have, you know, call it 500 units of whatever you're talking about. So you would say you'd pair those together because it's very easy to get a CAC under a thousand if you do 12 units in a month. It is not as easy to keep the CAC under that range and have tiers on those ranges and keep the volume of those. So these are the initial ones we put in. We put all these in with clauses that have like uh like they can make amendments to them and change them because there are large things that could change within the business. Like for example, everything could say the same, but close rate could double and the marketing department would get half the CAC. If your close rate goes from 20% to 40%, which is crazy, but like let's just say uh if it was to do that, your CAC would go in half because they're still paying the same amount for everything all the way down to the booking. Now, those bookings are just converting at twice the rate. So, like these need to potent these need to always be adjusted and they need to be monitored. And like as soon as it just cracks through that, the entire marketing team, yes, they should be comped in like a in a reasonable way, but to just like blanket now have them at this new floor because sales hit a new KPI and raise their floor is like not okay. So there's adjustments that need to be made. And then outputs with expected results. So almost everyone in here, it's kind of just like a version of this. Almost everyone is tied to one of these, how do I say this, in a into a KPI. And when you can't, it is like second and third order consequence view. So basically an example of that is like we aren't kping out an editor based on necessarily how it performs. We actually have done that but in in the current state so we have an editor for example that'll do uh organic and paid. And right now we pay for outputs. So we just pay for you know 22 of these x amount of time every whatever. Now that is paid more or less at like a base amount and we do increase them as you know load goes up as they perform as stuff we have in the past almost like too much um but we know that those output of those amount then go into this then go into this then hit the ad account then generally you know two win plus this plus this and then it equals that. So focusing on what the output is in order to reach the point in which it can be KPI where it can perform and then basically having like bonuses come back and kick back is like a big focus of us uh a big focus of ours and where we're going to start leaning in in organic and paid fulfillment side of things. This one we just got uh did a revamp. This team is like amazing. And another core thing here is like we have overpaid I think I go into this here but like we have overpaid everybody and like or maybe overpaid is the wrong word. We have paid everyone very very well. very well. So like the some of the biggest numbers on last year when we scaled up and like did not make as much margin it was ads obviously. So like I said acquisition was exploding but also how I want to say overpaid but like how well everyone was paid on the team was good. They have done very well for themselves uh working with us and it's kind of hard to like backpedal on some of that stuff but like there are scalable numbers and there are non-scalable numbers and some of those are not right. So we have an insanely good coaching team and we f in, you know, in this business and so how we're now basing this is based on client load. We're making it easier on admin and then doing things like tenure, competitions, NPS, like actual performance of the act of of of the role. We have tried to tie in things like retention and it just gets so messy because there are people who are going to uh um renew on their own. There are people who are going to renew through another rep. There are people who just only want the year and are not going to renew and it just like becomes this mess. and then also changes the frame from like coaching to like selling which is not the vibe either and not what we're looking for. So yeah, so we're building this out and then also having additional options of ways to make comp like doing things like the group coaching programs that we're talking about doing things like community that we're talking about and then baking these in in a clean way that someone who is tenured gets paid more and continues to as they are you know celebrated two year a fivey year whatever those numbers are and all this math is still being worked out on the exacts but these are the focus of them. competitions. We do things internal like review competitions. Um we do things like testimonial submissions. Uh we do things like challenges. Like we do all these different things in there. And then we have a constant inflow of NPS stuff where those are then triggered in there as well. So on marketing, if you're saying it's 5% of new cash, you have that as a pretty easy number of knowing what that is. Okay? So you can easily align for that. On this on fulfillment, the general goal you're going to be targeting. Hormos uses a number. He says 20 in service. I've heard 15. I've heard 50. So, it can kind of be whatever. Just do your own math. But knowing what the percentage you are willing to pay and then being able to back into the efficiency of said system so that the person fulfilling the service that's on your team is paid at market or above, ideally above for the amount of work they are doing. Okay? and that as a percentage is in alignment with what you are charging. Okay, so simple example, $10,000 of cash collected. Let's say you're using Horoszi number and I'm going to hate myself if I'm wrong on this, but let's just say it's 20 or 15. Let's call it 15. You collected $10,000. You have all your other expenses you have and then you have $1,500 15%. So $1,500 that goes to the person fulfilling it. So I've heard people have this for uh when they do agencies. I've people heard people do this with uh coaching. I've heard people do it with info that are like onetoone call sessions, all this stuff. So, if you have $1,500 that is across the year around whatever $110, whatever the math is quickly, uh a month that you can then pay that person. Now, how many do they how many client load do they need to get it to where they're making 70 grand a year or$120 or 300 grand a year, whatever the math is. And you need to be able to run these numbers and know these so you can basically pay someone competitively but also make it work for your math. So you want a happy person and you want good costs. And that is like a constant dance and like rock and hard place. But when you tear these all together and they all kind of mesh, everyone's making good money. Company is keeping good money and everyone's happy. and like the efficiencies you can get here and I'm not going to go into this but like AI and tech and all that that you can do here systems around those frameworks and then in this the way that you can do this and comp like there are plenty of ways to pay people really really well that are directly tied to I think it was uh Eddie Maloof talks about this in one of his videos he's like all my bonuses are literally only like my performance pay is literally only when the perform when we are making more money so it's like if the company if we now made 100,000 more in a performance thing like they get a direct portion of that 100,000. If we don't make more and the client doesn't pay us more, we don't pay the team more, like roughly speaking. So, yeah, it's a really good way to do it. It gets much harder when you start talking about fulfillment CS um for uh uh customer success, client success, whatever you want to call it. Um those we have things like uh bonus pools that are based around refund pools. So, the lower the refund rate, they hit different like thresholds of bonus pools. So they are in the main control of we call escalations and win backs or not win backs uh escalations and uh escalations refunds and like win backs I think it actually is. Um so it's basically how many of them got into here and wanted to refund or had like you know a billing concern that was deep enough to be qualified and then how many of them were saved. Uh and that is a pretty nice bonus pool that sits there that they get paid out on. So they're driving towards the KPI of keeping that number down and what we've done wrong. looking everything uh overpaid, underperformed. We have done things with sales comp. We have done things with coaching comp. We have done things with marketing bases and ops overall bases. We've had project managers that make 100 grand a year that we don't let project manage. Like it's been so bad before and now I think we know what we didn't know then and there's going to be 92 things that we don't know still that are going to come into the next one. But in the past we have overpaid for underperforming people. We have not leveraged the team correctly. Even today we had a conversation that was like we have XYZ grouping of people and like we're not leveraging their use. And it's not even like put them putting in more time necessarily. It's just like effectively how to use their strengths in order to do so. Uh we have tied people to either no KPI basically just you know they're making five grand 10 grand a month and they didn't have a clear KPI and even if they did have a KPI it wasn't tied to their comp and we still have people like that today. So we are working on adjusting that uh or being tied to the wrong KPI. We have had people connected to all Rev, all net rev technically all net rev when they could only control new. We have had people who are tied to backend recurring example of coach where yes they have some level of it but then it gets passed off. For example, if we run an internal promotion and we sell them all through marketing and through the company, then they're getting paid for it even though they were not directly the one who did it. You could argue they are the one who got them to enjoy their experience, but they were paid to get them to enjoy their experience on the actual piece. So, our coaches are fantastic. It was just like it was on us for putting in wrong KPIs that they couldn't control and that are messy. That's another big one is messy KPIs are not good. Hard to calculate, not good. Hard to understand comp plans, not good. Tiers and bonuses and triggers on this and whatever that are not autoc calculated and someone can't do in their head, not good. For simple stuff like this, W2 early jump, definitely go W2 if you're going to this scale and you want to sell and you want to be legal and you want to do all this stuff, but do not do it unless you want complexity. and we did it early and we probably shouldn't have when we did do it. Um, we're happy that we did now and it's like everything's compliant and to a te. Um, but it's a big jump. So, that was something we messed up in terms of comp and ROI because you easily add 20% on top of what you're going to pay. So, if you're paying 100 grand now it's 120. Um, effort not output kind of similar to this. The no KPI we've just paid for time more or less that was not tied to an output and have been burned. Scoreboards we've had them incorrect and we've had them non-public at all. So people who are getting paid on a KPI that they don't know what it is until you get paid. Dumb. And then we have just overall increased the floor of things a lot of the time. So W2 is a good example but kind of bad example. W2 you're going to have 20 reps that are now all going to be making XYZ base. Uh or you're going to have them on hourly that now needs to be tracked. And when you increase the floor like that, you instantly eat it just overhead. So you add 200 grand a month or whatever the number is and know that you now need to do three times that. You need to do an extra 600 grand in cash in order to pay for the new increase you just put in just arbitrarily. So that's a fun nugget. But if your team wins and your margin dies, you didn't build comp, you built a chaos machine. So I hope this was helpful. Um I am on day like 62 in a row of doing these and my brain is like I'm just bouncing. This is all I do all day is just this kind of stuff. And so I'm trying to keep this on pace for like where I'm at and where we're at in the journey of things. We were talking about all these. We did revamps on Monday. Today's Tuesday. Uh we were rebuilding this this morning. So I just figured this would be real time good and I hopefully this one was relatively helpful for you. Um daily update. We are humming along. We did 10 and something yesterday mid. Yeah, we are doing okay. And then but still still with the consistency. So, it's going to take a month, two months to fully refresh that out. And in the meantime, we are changing things on marketing. I think I'm going to do that tomorrow. Talking about our marketing setup and some of the changes we're making. We did a ton of split tests, things won, things lost. Um, actually, everything lost. I think one thing won. Uh, or one thing is actively winning, but has not been crowned as the winner. Um, and yeah, so low ticket, we're making some big adjustments there on what we're doing with that entire setup because ours has more or less acted as like a retargeting function and you can't really scale into cold as well. So, we're making some adjustments around that. But the system and the flow works well and yeah, so everything is in the right direction. But that's the daily update. www.ryclog.com ranclugg.com must use the www wwdock and you'll have all the videos I've made every single day for the last 62 days 61 I don't even know 61 today 62 so tech marketing ops sales all the things hit me on IG comment below these hit me on X any of the things happy to help thanks for being along on the journey Yeah.

# how we are changing OPS to hit $100M (full breakdown) | EP61
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ugVJGDLLY

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing my newly updated operations plan for our weekly cadence. We have extremely strong leads in place now for tech, sales, marketing, and fulfillment. So, I am rebuilding how we're doing our weekly meeting structure both at the operational cross sync level as well as the department level for each specific one of these buckets. So, we're going to talk through what we're doing, why we're doing it, how we are getting data, visibility, communication all through to each department, and then some future evolutions and concerns I already have going into this. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done 72.96. I just updated this this morning, and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent, opportunity, and networking with cool people doing the same All right, so let's get into it. It's Monday. I'm back. Very personal weekend, and it was like hard to make videos, but we're here now. So, here's the overall general structure. I literally built this this morning at like 6:00 in the morning. So, the operations meeting exists right now. Sits on Tuesday. It's an hour. Sometimes it's been an hour and a half in the past, but right now it's an hourong thing. And again, we're going to be talking weekly here, not quarterly check-ins, not annual planning strategy. This is literally like weekly ops like in the trenches how it's operating. So, operations is an hour and that is going to include I'll actually go down to that down here, but it's going to include all these department heads and then this portion is new. So this is what I'm newly rolling out where we're going to have a tech ops which technically has existed. We're going to have sales ops, marketing ops, and fulfillment ops. And then that is going to be basically the midlevel or like the the decision making and kind of higher level portion. And then each one will have the actual like team meetings. Okay, so that's a general gist. So sources for where I learned a lot of this stuff and could be I could be completely off base and change this in a month. That's why I like making these videos every day because I literally am showing you what I'm doing and what is working, what is not working and sometimes I up so it just happens. But we have operated off of light like a lighter version of EOS for a long time. We used to be in char stuff. I actually really like that because it's like a waterfall approach. It's like you know you set things at the higher level and they waterfall down and projects and timelines waterfall down into different departments and different timeline schedules. Um but I don't know if he still has this thing and I don't have access to it anymore. So we're running our own version. Um, and then lean. I've liked that for a while. So, this is just stuff I've learned online. We've paid for some of it and a majority of it is just me reading books and attempting and navigating real time. So, company ops, this is that first meeting. So, this is how we do the initial I'm sorry, the current meeting that exists on Tuesday that we go through. Uh, it's a cross functional cyst. Uh, sync is the goal of it. So, we are prioritizing projects and we are proactively getting ahead of things that could be blockers. In current state the attendees for this is CEO, COO, CMO um so again executive uh operating marketing a chief of sales uh product people outbound director is setter manager senior tech lead is basically CTO but not yet and CS manager. So just starting there, what this meeting likely will look like into the future as we scale like aggressively will just be these sea levels. Um because now like these all exist more or less under one of these other positions and for a long time it was like you know three or four of us where these were included. Um these are like super good people and great at what they do. It'll just be interesting to see if they end up living in this operations meeting level because like for example CS lives under CPO. uh senior tech lead actually currently lives under me but like the other portion is if they upgrade or not upgrade or if they you know ascend up to being like the CTO like we're in talks of him becoming full full tech like he basically already is but I still do a big portion of it and like I want him having budget responsibility and all these different pieces so as he scales up into this then he would exist at this level because that is the conversation and right now they already do and we're in the meeting and then this one we just hired a cso so in the past it was outbound director it was basically setter manager and closer manager on there, but now we have a cso that's going to that's basically above that position like on an org chart basis. And um so yeah, it'll be interesting to see the structure. This is how the meeting actually runs. I have a really funny story about this, but I accidentally said I thought this was a segue and it's really a segue, but so everyone just basically sits and chats about whatever for the first two to five minutes, then rain it in. We start off with going through the scorecards and just quickly look across the data there. We then will do a rock check-in. and rocks are just quarterly. So everyone just rips down their list with that we have set from the quarterly meeting and it's are we on track are we not quick sentence if we're not the scorecard is manually input because for the longest time I had everything automated and people did were not tied to their numbers they had no explanation they had no understanding so they are manually filled in uh that's a big one for us little nugget that I still don't love but it makes it so tied to their numbers a little bit more and then customer and team these are like wins and highlights so anybody on the team uh that something like amazing happened like oh one of the closers went three for three for three for three for example last week so they had like three hat tricks in a row um different uh customer ones are brought ahead you know we we have a client's win channel that they'll brought in so it's basically just like a just a revamping and re reamping up of the team and then to-do checkup is from the prior week and what was assigned for to-do and is there an update on it is it done or is it not and if it's not why and then it rolls into ids which is basically the entire meeting and that's identify discuss and solve. And that comes straight out of this EOS framework up here. So they have that traction book and a couple others. But basically, we're just you have a non-stop thing of open list that you're adding. So things that you want to that you have identified basically that you want discussed and solved. And then um you are then assigning them to to-do. When they get one, they get one owner and a deadline and a department. And they're tagged by department. And that's important for this next part. And then uh some and then if they're like multi-week, we a lot of time we'll put them in an in progress line. So it's like it's actually been started and like the things are happening behind the scenes. And yeah, so that's like the general gist of this. It actually works pretty well. And the core of this is to understand that these are crossf functional items. So if they're like isolated, and this is like very candidly where I've had an issue with this so far is everything kind of lives on here. So, like an example of a tech project that's just very one-off will live on this as well because it's like me and senior tech lead talking about it and we'll assign it on that board and it's like it's not the cleanest way to do it. So, that's why I'm making adjustments and shifts to this. So, what we're newly rolling out is going to be and then we're going to go back and forth and I'll explain the differences. So, we're going to have department level operations meetings. So, back up to here what I'm what I was sharing here. So, right now, this is the only one that exists. And then we basically have like oneto ones with everybody on the different departments. But they're scattered. They're like 15-minute blocks. It's like quick check-ins. What's a project update? What's a like it's just not clean enough to know like to be encompassing to say, "Oh, you marketing department is what I'm going to use as a majority of these." But, you know, you guys have seven projects going on. You have a DTA, you have a low ticket, you have a this. What are you doing with a low ticket? Four projects in there because you're doing, you know, CRO on the front end. You're doing AOV boosters, but then those connect back here and like are they getting filmed and who's producing them? We're talking like budgets, like all these different things are scattered and they need a cadence around themselves that is different than an actual just like marketing huddle that has the team on it because we're going to have conversations here, here, and here that are all three going to be different. This one is going to be like marketing and where does it touch the overall company goals and pieces because marketing you know while maybe oh this is all we talk about for in like this example it's like we also talk about sales and we also talk about tech we also talk about like these need to be spread out and have crossunctional like there's always the one thing that needs to be solved which for a long time was marketing right now it's sales next I already have a feeling it's going to be fulfillment just based on how much inflow is going to occur but we want these to continue to be running and that's been something we've messed up in the past where we kind of like reactively just come to whatever's broken And like you're always going to have a bottleneck. It's inherently like that's whatever. It's physics. It's the universe. You're always going to have a bottleneck. But making sure that the other ones are trying to like keep pace and scale into them and be proactive is what my goal is of this. Okay. So, in these department ones, we're going to have like tactical progress, focus, progress, and focus. So, right now, how the meetings look and how they're scheduled, this is literally starting this week. Um, that's why I like these videos. I'm doing this real time. I'm going to be able to check back in a month, be like, "Wow, these suck or these are amazing." So, um, it's going to be the CEO, COO, and really what it was going to be is us, but because, uh, our CEO is very sales and marketing focused, uh, he's going to be on those, and then I'm likely going to just do the other ones. Um, but COO, department lead, and then relevant team. This is the question mark right now because like in marketing, for example, we have a creative director that's like very, you know, high level and understands a lot of this. So, right now, I think it's just going to be the CMO, and then we're going to include the creative director. And like, how far down that do we go? um that's a question mark right now. So right now the core thing I'm focused on is like basically us department lead but actually having a structure. So the big difference that does not exist right now in our current setup with the um the one to one schedule it's basically like what did you work on? What are you what are you working on in the future and like what are you prioritizing? So we're actually going to change that up to be quick little segway in the beginning the 30 minute blockers. We are going to have a scorecard. This is another part of like this is all in motion but I need to identify what KPIs are specific um or are relevant to this meeting and I the biggest thing that I am like so focused on happening is I do not want this to become like recur like uh like overlapping because if this becomes like actually overlapping like they're reporting the same numbers they reported here if they are bringing the uh you know projects if they're duping it from this board to this board like that is going to be a shitow and I do not want that. So, I'm trying to get ahead of that and be like, okay, that's why it was beautiful with the sharpen thing. It was waterfall, so it was like it could only exist in the next one from the original. Um, so like they they stored down, which EOS isn't really like that, like kind of like that, but not super. So, staying ahead of that, making sure that there's clean data in here. So for example, something in marketing could be you know you could have a full marketing board that's like you know what were what were total uh bookings what were total you know apps bookings cost per across here across these ranges what were uh how many new ads like what were the inputs so how many new ads were tested um how many new what you know team stack did it grow did it leave like everything marketing specific that you wouldn't necess normally do in an operations meeting because in the operations meeting it's like three or four it's like how many ads were tested how many ads were uh created uh what was the net backend CPA and one other one something but like that's all you need to know here but in this meeting it's like let's go deeper and then this meeting let's go even deeper um because those are the people actually clicking the keys so scorecarding and then ids the exact same framework as up here so it is like what are the projects in place I already gave some examples of how those could look in marketing but like we have nine different things happening in marketing and like last week we're like oh what happened with that one thing and it's like oh well someone forgot about it basically is a simple way to put it and we never tested it. we had it built or we have like these three VSSLs sitting over here and it's like we ran a split test but someone turned it off because of these metrics and it's like it's just scattered right now and like we cannot have that at the you know team size we're at and yeah so the to go a layer deeper on this one and where I'm focused on where I'm building is I need to come up with a way we have never had like we operate basically off like these large cash flow sheets that we've managed and that's how we see everything I can see basically everything um But what you can't do is really like segment expense-wise. So, we try to run lean. We obviously have not in a lot of ways. And now I'm going back in to clean that up. So, I want to be able to meet with these department ops uh in these meetings. And, you know, for a simple example, let's call it 5% of net new cash is what I want the marketing department to be. And being able to show them a budget of that um is going to be very important. Same thing within fulfillment. So, it's like uh aligning their budgets, what they can use in contest, bonus pools, in CS and in coaching, like how they can do those. Um, they need budgets, they need math, they need data, they need all these things. And I think I have probably not done a good job. I mean, honestly, I haven't even had the data. So, there's definitely done I've definitely done a bad job. If I don't even have the numbers, they definitely don't have the numbers. So, um, I am focused on trying to do that and trying to come up with a way to do that where it makes sense. the data is clean and easy to make sense to them. They can optimize around it and then that all that backs out, you know, per unit, per department across XYZ range, that it always works for the company and is still a really good customer experience in whatever way and we don't have high churn, all the things. So now some future evolutions and concerns about this. Uh the biggest thing here is like I don't I I like I want to run lean so I don't want to slow things down. the big focus of these and like it's pretty lean. is pretty lean if you look at things like right now I mean think if you're in sales if you're the sales management you are in the operations meeting on Tuesday we have a 30-minute touch point here we're talking also ad hoc whenever we want and do meetings and then you have your teams basically meeting is five times a week is is a daily huddle tech because there is no team we just have this meeting and this meeting and that's it marketing right now and this is like a question mark but right now they have operations or the the CMO is in the operations meeting we are now having this marketing ops meeting that'll be on Thursdays and then they have their own marketing huddle that already exists on Tuesday and it's like it'll be interesting to see how much information carries through once we have like that flow of info and how much gets passed down to the team because dream state is like we don't exist on these meetings and then right now we exist on these and I facilitate these and then the next iteration and layer of this is well actually I kind of jumped but is replacing myself out of these. I want to run these for I don't even know how long but like until we're at crazy numbers because I want to pulse and same reason that I you know I made a video about this yesterday like where my focus is but it's like the ops portion of this but it's also like understand the sales portion understanding piece of the marketing it's understanding fulfillment and not to master any of them just to be like dangerous. So I want to know things about fulfillment and community and recurring and the math behind it and then the financial across all this. I want to know stuff about how we're doing automations and tech. Like I just want a finger on the pulse and I'm not going to be the best at any of them on purpose. Um, but I want to be able to speak the speak and be able to do that. So, that's a big focus. Um, so I can replace myself out over time or even in tandem. I've already talked to people who have like project managers that work side by side them. Um, I've never had a project manager like a personal assistant or anything, but I think it would be nice to have a like project manager style person that can do this and then we can then I don't have to click the keys. If I can just have the conversations and have, you know, four to six hours of meetings like this a week, that would be that's like dream state. And someone else is there like actually breaking them down into ClickUp boards and structuring and reminding people of deadlines and doing that, but we get to have like the actual conversations around it. That would be dream state for the foreseeable future and that would be fun to do uh for me at least. That's what I would view as fun. So that's a goal. And then the last piece of this is the duplication source of truth. big concern I have because I've seen it happen with tech is something happens here. Tech already made their own ids list because we're funny and we like the techy stuff and the boards and the structure. So, they already built their own. I'm building out a marketing one, a sales one and a fulfillment one. Marketing sales. Yeah, fulfillment ones. Um, but they already built one out and I'm already seeing things that get assigned here inside our ops meeting than he has assigned inside the department level one. It's like that's we don't want that. So, because then you're duplicating things. you can mark it off in one place, not the other. Like you need a source of truth. So figuring out how to connect the ClickUp boards in a clean way and or just knowing that like once something lives in here, it's cross sync. If it's noncross sync, then you remove it from here. Like basically changing where they live based on objective. So if a tech project also touches, you know, it's a marketing tech thing or it's a fulfillment onboarding thing, it lives here. And if it's tech specific like we're going to update the database language of this or we're going to change you know the a great example we're going to change everything from zap to naden and it's like that would live department here it's very tactical it's it's focused on tech only tech so we would keep that in here that does not need to exist up here the issue is sometimes I will have conversations and I take blame for this where I'll be like okay so like hey what about this let's update this and do this and like I have put projects in here that because I kind of live in techland a little I will like assign out or have conversations about it to for it in here when it could just be in this meeting. And then the other issue or or thing I potential thing I see is the speed like having these meetings on Tuesday and Thursday. It's like I don't know. I think there's you people can do a lot in a short amount of time. And I think this maybe breeds like delays where it's like oh we'll talk about it on Tuesday and it's like Thursday. It's like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and then you don't talk about to Tuesday and then Tuesday to Thursday it's like oh not enough time. So then it'll be by the following Tuesday. Okay. So, like I need to make sure everyone is in an understanding of like uh deadlines and that deadlines are realistic, not just drawn to the end of the week. It's like no, how long is it going to take you? It's like two hours. Okay, like let's do it in let's let's do it in two hours. Um so, yeah. So, that's a big thing. But hopefully this makes sense to you. I will update on how this goes. I think it'll be it's definitely easy for me to manage other than the boards and the agendas. That's like the pain. But Eddie and Mina and all those guys will tell me I'm an idiot for not having a personal assistant. But it is not happened yet. So, we will see. But hopefully this was helpful. Daily update. All these videos going into a doc sorted by tech, marketing, sales, ops, all the things, mindset, and then uh you can filter by these and sort out. I'm on day 61 in a row of doing these. Uh yesterday was like 50k. We're still struggle busing with the sales portion, but the sales hasn't even been rolled out. like the new system, new scripts, new anything. Um, but we have some exciting updates that are coming with that into this week. So, Monday 8 a.m. and we will see what happens into the week. Drop any comments on this. Those crack me up when you guys have funny ones. Sorry if these weekend ones were a little more mindsetty. Um, I had a bunch of stuff that was happening in like real life, so I was on a computer sparingly, which is rare. But that's that. Talk to you guys soon. Hit me on X or IG. Bye.

# inside my INFO DIET... what I'm focused on this month | EP60
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8mrAG1Eg3c

In today's video, I'm going to be talking about my current info diet as of May 2025. All of these topics here are things I have either been stuck on before or I forecast that I will be. So, I'm learning about them now. Everything from personal operating system, sales team, ops, backend, economics, and cash flow, and so much more. So, we're going to break them down and go into the topics that I'm learning about. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with a goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Uh, I was initially going to make this and share like the actual channels and stuff. I think I'll make a separate one for that, but we're going to go through the topics and like why I'm currently studying these. Um, I'm a big believer in like the one thing. So, I'll go through what like the one thing is right now, but I have my pulse on all these. So podcasts, books that are coming like chat GBT conversations at 5 a.m. like all of them are around these and I'm going to go into why and then we'll talk about the main one that's currently the blocker. So personal operating system things that I've identified for me personally uh that I need more or less like focus on uh deep work. So I will either have meeting back to back to back to back to back or I will have full empty days and I am just not efficiently hitting the deep work. When I first started doing these videos, it was like a fun new thing. And it was really easy to get up at five every single day, do these for two, three uh two, three hours and get them done. And now, like even with a full day uh or an empty day, I will like, you know, this is 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday of doing this. And I should not be doing that. And it's just bad management. So, I'm focusing on deep work and how to do that. So, I basically buy it by the calendar. So, if I can fit it onto the calendar, it happens. And I'm not even doing that. So, this is a big one. Dopamine reset. everything from quick scrolling to freaking nicotine to what you can imagine. Uh it is frying things that I'm doing in a short-term basis in work. And so I needed like a reset of that. So I have like eliminated so much of the stuff that is just like scroll and this and that and trying to focus on this. Um I'm still pretty bad at it honestly, but I have identified this as like a core piece that is broken here. Routines. Same thing there. It kind of just goes back to the calendar. I like thrive off routines. Uh you hear a lot of people talk about like if you don't hit your routine and then it like throws off your whole day and like I lean into that camp and that is not good. Um I don't want that but I also like when I'm in routine but I need to be able to be adaptable outside of it. So trying to evolve back from that but mainly I think solving for with the calendar thing and where I'm going with this is I have hired a personal biz coach that I work with every Monday every other Monday that is just like all about productivity structuring out calendar structuring out like thinking backwards from goals. Um, and right now it just more or less feels like I'm just like in the trenches and not as much focus like future focused. Um, someone I'm gonna name at least a specific on this one. Dan Martell, I think he does a fantastic job. Watch all his stuff uh that goes back and forth more so lifestyle. Like I'm a big believer in basically, you know, like I always say on this, but like listening to people who have what you want um in a specific aspect of their life. So like just because someone has a cranking business that you want to emulate does not mean that they have a good personal life that you want to emulate. And you need to be able to identify that. um Dan, at least from what he shows externally and from people I've heard that have worked with him, he has a kind of full encompassed setup. So, I really like to kind of consume a lot of his content and look at how he lives as well as what he talks about. Um, and then some of his like books and like he just came out with a new SAS book that's fantastic and you can apply it into, you know, our world of info and coaching. But yeah, I think he's like an all-around good guy that I think operates by this. Um, another one is Oh man, I'm blinking so hard, but the guy who had the Fantasy Factory, I'm blinking. Oh, Rob Deer Deck. So Rob Deer Deck has a really good one around this as well and he has a whole personal operating system. So I like guys like that who talk data systems structure uh around their personal lives as well and like fully block that out. They still have like you know deep work but they have deep personal they have deep friends you know like they go in all those buckets and I think I do a terrible job of that. So I'm trying to focus on learning that AI infra leverage. Um so what I'm trying to focus on here right now and I'm posting all over X like trying to get feedback and learn things through NAN and places like that. um or learn about Nan through X and where everyone's pointing me on YouTube. So, I'm consuming a ton of it and then to be candid, I'm giving a ton of it off to my senior tech lead who is going through and as the first layer, we're going to replace and enhance all of our current automations. So, we use 3 million or something like that Zaps a month. We have custom databases that we store for like analytics tool of our coaching, all these things and uh a ton of stuff in the sales and marketing front. So the first goal of using AI is basically just to replace enhancements, I'm sorry, replace automations and then go through and enhance them. So where can we leverage actual AI because that's just an automation replacement and that's just a cost savings. But I want to be able to do it and enhance and layer it into current systems. So we have so many things that happen in the marketing sales front that are automated but could be enhanced through automation either by literally adding things to them or cleaning pieces or um lead scrubbing. Like there's just so many other pieces that we haven't touched. So I want to do that first and then I want to focus on roles. So everything from a billing admin to customer support to the coaching system and figure out the best ways to replace but mainly enhance like kind of how we do now. Um, I think there's always going to be a piece, not always, but you know, for a long future, uh, a place for the role. It's just going to be enhanced, which ideally, let's use a simple example, but if someone has 50 clients per coach, we can enhance how they do their role through AI and they can take a hundred, their cost can slightly go up, but the cost overall to the company would go down. So, it' be really nice. So, that and then I also am focusing on some version of a personal AI. Everything I talk about on here when I use GPT is like my basically store just master threads that I use. And I know that's not like the best long-term future way to do it. So having one that would be trained up on all the context like I have certain threads, but like an all-encompassing that I could personally use either local um or you know essentially local, but that is you know custom to me. So I think that would be very helpful for me. So again, these are all like my current info diet where I'm consuming all of this is all going to be YouTube. I've not bought a course. I have a coach for this which is paid. So speedrun a bit there. Um I buy books on these all the time. These this is all free right now. I haven't bought anything um which is actually interesting but we pay I mean I pay for a lot of softwares and then senior tech leads in there and I play around but I haven't fully bought or done anything. All this is free info funnel and conversion scaling. I was going to tweet about this or X or whatever you call it now um about this but essentially I'm just consistently looking for different funnel types. So go to that conference open my mind a lot on webinars, web classes, challenges, CMO talks about all these different things and I like to stay focused. I mean, we did one uh VSSL opt-in funnel that was 70 million. Like, we don't need it doesn't need to be crazy, but also there's just different ways for the messaging and framing based on the economics. Um, that can change based on like the different funnel types. You can do a ton of volume that liquidates. Um, you know, the lower ascension rate, for example, as long as the math or the economics work. You can do more the straight line, what we do. You can go DTA and go straight to it, which is way cheaper. So, we're testing these things right now, but I'm just like learning about all of them and I'm doing it inside. Nothing held back Facebook group is a big one that I do. Um I don't really have any podcasts that talk about this because I like to watch them or read them more than I do listen to them. Um but yeah, I think that's I think that kind of sums that piece up. The direct response is really a future piece of this where especially if we have a lot of low ticket, it's going to be very direct response heavy marketing team is building out and we'll get to that down here with like team and or design sales team ops. This is if I was to say there's one thing right now, this is the one. Um and we are basically I don't want to say solved for it but we definitely started the process. We have had marketing issues for a long time got the CMO in and solved for that. So even up there like they are coming up with the ideas. I just like to be privy to what is happening or like have a finger on the pulse in the market so I can understand and maybe give either opinion or random options or look at look at what they're doing in like a different light. So that's the goal there. Um, but with the sales team ops, we just brought a new uh cso in and he started, you know, three days ago, so it hasn't even touched it yet. Um, but I think it's going to be a huge shift, which is then going to be more purchases on colder and more volume. Uh, which is just going to feed back to marketing and like it's going to change the entire machine. So, that's kind of like betting on an unknown, but I have pretty strong conviction in that just based on our stats and based on multiple people we interviewed all saying the same things like in a vacuum. So, uh, basically, yeah, how to structure that team for scale. The compensation framework is a big one. Like our current setup is very, very wrong. Uh, so I've heard just like different, you know, just not incentivizing the right things, not tying to numbers in the correct way, not having thresholds on the right things. And yeah, so I'm excited to change that up. Renewal framework, it's a sales function. We haven't launched that back end. We're going to, I believe it's actually tomorrow, and that's going to be a sales function, but live within a CS and fulfillment team. So, trying to figure that out and understand how that works. And I think I go into it down here, but I've just bought like eight books talking about gamification and community management, like trying to incentivize people to stay in a community as like a lifer style thing, not just for like these upfront activation points to get XYZ result. Like really build community that's extremely sticky. Um, because I think that's going to be a big piece for enterprise value in the future. So talking about how to basically do the renewal piece and in the sales process, but then also get them to be sticky, which is kind of more of this like team and back end. I think actually I talk about in here, but uh supporting leaders, how to support the team in here to like not overstep. I think we maybe did that a little too much in the past and I don't want to do that in the future one because it's not scalable and I don't think I'm the best by any means and all in sales world um and there are people much better. So just making sure they have the tools and the data they need and that comes down to this tracking and dashboards. I've done this myself forever and I think it'll be very important into the future to have somebody and have so just basic basically understanding a broader picture of this. So I'm looking at like gamified dashboards for consumers. I'm looking on B2B side. I'm looking at it in sales world and I'm actually trying to plug these into all parts of the company in a way that incentivizes the right behavior and shows the right metrics. So this is big and I want to hire for this actually. So, I'm trying to learn it more so I can like hire the right people because I want to understand how the data works um behind it. Backend economics and cash flow. I talk about this all the time now, but liquidation timelines, cash collection, financing. So, external thirdparty financing could be a big lift that we I think I get to make an announcement or like something to the sales team this week. We are finalizing a new one. the cash collection periods like all of this basically talking about the risk and finance portion of the company has always been just like I don't say not paid attention to but just like we've just been pushed so much cash it didn't really like matter to us it wasn't a big focus didn't matter if we had an 82% cash collection 85 or 90 say like for us at the time we're just ramming volume and we were focused on the front end which was stupid at the time and I don't want to get caught holding the bag on the way up next time so this uh margin drift is huge I'm trying to lock everything in now where we're at with you a little bit sub two million a month and make sure that now when we scale back up and go 30 50 100 that I have it locked so I have like automated reporting that comes in I have source of truth for the data of the marketing sales and finance part tied together because that was a big piece um some payment orchestration platform stuff I was tweeting about this today or exing I don't know what the [ __ ] you're supposed to say but um payment orchestration platforms because we have a lot of risk sitting in stripe we have very very low chargeback like point whatever three something like that But I just have heard that storing the tokens and and the subscriptions is going to be better somewhere else. So I've been trying to like research and do all these. Again, when I say like my info diet, it's like I have podcasts about this [ __ ] I have YouTube videos. I will sit here for eight hours and just like watch YouTube videos about how people build NAM things and build them on the side. I will watch Cole Gordon videos talking about sales ops. I will watch everybody you've ever heard of talk about funnels and conversion. Jeremy Haynes, Alen Sultanic, AI stuff. I don't even know their names. I just watch like every nen thing you guys tag me in. back end economics and cash flow. A lot of time it's horos for like the info side and then these are like OG people who like buy businesses and like not private equity is the wrong word but like the online boring business people talk about a lot of these and a lot of people don't in our world. Um so yeah I just I'm like trying to find pockets of this from I don't want to say other industries but like other pockets of the industry and try and learn from that. So hopefully that makes sense. And then gross profit breakdowns. We've never had different offers that we really had to think about this. So I'm trying to understand the volume requirements for the different ones to hit like ideal gross profit breakdowns things like group coaching the info like coach onetoone coaching is pretty locked in but you just have to do x amount of volume in order to you know all that stuff how much what's our you know consistent overhead now that we have these certain team members that are variable but not tied to overall revenue but have like different KPIs. So like try and build comp models and there are people out there that can just do this but I I like to understand it a little bit before I hire for it. So that's where I'm going with that team and org design re-roll organization. Um, so that doesn't make sense, but basically I mean just like the different roles and instructuring actual making sure there's less overlap so we can clean up roles and make sure that we have, you know, everyone on the boat is needed and in the right positions. So is basically what that means. I'm doing new mate meeting cadence. So I've been doing like EOS style books and stuff like that. Um, and I do these like leading up to basically. And then department level ids and department level budgeting. Those start this week. So I moved and changed the meeting structure. So now we're gonna have a fulfillment ops. We're gonna have a tech ops. We're gonna have a marketing ops and a sales ops that I will be leading for with the department heads of each instead of we have our master one that's like all the team in one operating group. And it's basically what's going on every department back and forth. This is going to be one dedicated to them with essentially their own project list that exists. Um so that'll be super nice. And then I'm getting budgets built out with like expense sheets that they're tied to and that they are responsible for. I pulled the tech one for example. That's how this entire NATO end conversation began because I saw our Zap bill and I hadn't seen it and I don't know how long because I don't have my eyes on it and because I don't have other people having their eyes on it which is the bigger issue that this will solve. So being you know compensating with oh you save us 10 grand a month on whatever and you know I'll give you two or what you know whatever the number is. Um, but just having them own their own budgets. Doing the same thing with marketing, trying to keep it under X percentage of net new revenue, um, or net new cash, how we do it. So, you know, if we're doing a million a month in net new cash, how big should the sale or should the marketing team be like the total fee and what percent like what dollar is that? So, knowing that we might be fat going into it, but then that it can't rise over X% in the future and then having them manage that and manage their team and then building to replace myself in this entirety. So I'm trying to build it in a structured way, not just duct tape together from the get. So learning from a lot of people who can do that so that I can plug in an operator later when I don't want to be on meetings for 16 hours a week. Um probably more than that, but just for that part. So and then the data for each department, which is basically just comes back to this budgeting. So it's data and finance. So there's like the non-financial metrics that we track and then there's the actual like company specific metrics like retention numbers or uh escalations or uh customer support response times or whatever. So like pulling what's important for each department and then content flywheel and brand scaling. This is like me and the business. So I look at this for my stuff and then I also look at this for the business. Once I started doing it a little bit more for myself, I realized how kind of I don't want to say like dropping the ball but missing we were on how much content output we have in the business. Um, so yeah, bu put putting an organic engine together for the business. Um, schedule and reach for personal basically being able to do stuff into the future and in different pockets. Right now I focus on very specific and I kind of like that but organ I I'll see um I've been doing research on other people and talking to other people who like like to own keyword phrases. So I watch things like uh Mark Scales brands, Mark runs brand like whatever Mark runs ads. He's hilarious. Um I watch all his stuff and talk to him. Um, I watch Leila for this stuff a lot of the time. She has a lot of good stuff here. And then again, back to like EOS and like proper org chart, um, you know, team building style stuff a lot on YouTube. And then I have a ton of books that are actually on that that um, I'm actually not reading right now, but I read right before I did the last roll out. And this is going to be important to me as I start to like actually operate these because I don't like to show up and look like an idiot if they're not good. Um, these I already talked about clipping personal and business. I see all the stuff around clipping. I just don't want the wrong audience. So, I have tons of people in DMs talking about how to do it for me. And then I'm also trying to consider if we can do it for the business, but it would probably be for something low ticket because the other issue is if we have a mass volume increase, whether that's affiliate, whether that's clips, whether that's whatever, and they have the wrong quality of audience and it's also too much, it'll break the back end because everything requires a phone call. So, trying to like navigate lightly on this so we're not like hitting the wrong countries, hitting the wrong target demo. And that's both for me personally. I don't want 10,000 followers on something if they're just like not the right person. I would rather organically do it with like high quality. So, I do think this is extremely interesting. I just don't know how we'd use it in ours. Um, and then that also leads from cold for or for from organic. Um, I bought the AFL thing from EMO and I buy [ __ ] everything. And, uh, he talks a lot about this and how a majority of their stuff has come from that and we just have so much content that we haven't optimized for. We made like there was a video on the business page that did like 38 times the normal views got all this stuff got over a thousand followers is like responsible for you know a bunch of new inflow of apps bookings call you know all that stuff and it's like oh my gosh we do however many videos a week for however many years and like that's the first one like that stands out that did that just shouldn't be like that. So that and then this low ticket community as we start to do more volume like it goes from like top of funnel organic to the next layer which is like a paid version of it or actually a free community and then a paid community potentially or just straight to high ticket. So we're trying to navigate how to do that and then the the community portion I talked about uh up here is going to be part of this backend uh economics that we're actually going to map out. I didn't put it up here did I? I didn't. But talking about that backend program and keeping it super sticky. I think that is going to be huge and that is also going to be more brand scaling because there's going to be brand elements ambassadors stuff like that. So this is like where my focus is. I don't know if this is directly info diet. Um maybe we'll do a better one. I see people do those charts where it's like I consume you know hormone this I do you know I mean if I have my YouTube thing open here but if I look it's like I have lead genen guys. I have founder startup guys who don't take uh VC money Iman Nick Bear Jeremy Haynes. Um who else we got? Diary of Diary of a CEO. I watch SEO guys. I watch health guys like fitness style. Actually, I don't really watch those, but I follow them still. Yeah, Mark Builds Brand says hilarious live limiting beliefs. Uh, paid media left and right, all of those. So, whatever. I basically I'm just plugged into a lot of same things you guys are. I just kind of intently watch certain ones um that I focus on and then pay for their stuff if I can find it. So hopefully this gives an insight as to what I'm focusing on currently. Business sameish spot. It's one point whatever high ones. So haven't broke two yet, but sales manager just started. I think that in itself is going to take it to three again and then 35ish. And then we have some stuff cooking that will take it from 5 to 8. And yeah, that's where the current setup is. So getting ahead of this so that when it does become time to need these, I hopefully will be privy enough to either be able to hire for it or solve it myself. when I need to. So proactive versus last time I was reactive slash never even did it and we didn't hold the margin. So that's what I got and that's the update daily doc here. I have tech marketing sales ops all the things sorted into this doc of every video. This is the 60th one in a row I believe. Um I need to probably make a new series style that is going to be like specific like a toz building one of these or something like that. So, drop some comments with some ideas because I don't want these to get dry and me just go through. But this is it. This is what we do every day. Same [ __ ] over and over. So, appreciate you guys. Talk on X or IG or whatever. Talk soon.

# my story, niche selection, cash tracking... (44min Q&A) | E59
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9F7m7aO4hA

In today's video, I'm going to be doing a Q&A of all the questions you guys submitted to the request box. I just briefly looked this over and there's some gold in here. So, I'm going to be going through things like how did I get my start in info, how I made my first 1 to 10k, what our biggest bottleneck is, the niche selection process, and so much more. Last year, we did $30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. I have nicotine. I have caffeine. And this one might be a long one, but we're going to go deep. So the process of the WB, which is our main company's come up and how you met Nikki and Luke, which are the co-founders of this main company, the one I'm referring to above. When you knew this was going to happen to be the scale it was now, at what point you dropped out to make it happen? I didn't, but I'll talk about that. uh and just kind of the background curious. So the process of how that came to be and I've talked about this in other things but just so we can answer it here. Um essentially he met her uh in a gym and basically was helping her get clients. Then joined the consulting.com program and learned how to basically make her the expert and do it through productized service. So build a course around her, all of that. Um actually ended up the first core thing they started doing um to actually make money was a low ticket monthly app. So, like a 7-day free trial, $27 a month with an Otto uh for lifetime access, basically to like get the economics to work on the paid ads. But there was no ascension rung. So, that only got to like 30, it was like 30kish up to like 100k a month. Um, and that is around when I joined. So, there was three to five people probably on there. There was like a billing admin and a community manager and then them. So, they're going through a rebrand over 2WB at the time and that's when I came on. So when you knew and then just like further into that then uh Luke and I basically were like how do we take this thing to 10 million? I was like hey we're already in this program let's do a callunnel. So we started selling an info product that they had already pre-built based on the consulting.com framework on how to build like a a proper course community and like group coaching model. Um and we sold that for $500 over the phone. Then quickly scaled that up to $1,000 uh lifetime access and then $1,500. And we were doing a ton of volume and that's how we hit a million a month. And then we transitioned after two years of doing that. Basically we did like 10 million and then 12 millionish. Um and then after that we moved over to onetoone coaching and selling that which has higher fulfillment costs and I talked about that in the video but that's how with a higher ticket we did a little less volume of units but that's how we went from 12 to 30 million roughly speaking. So now when you knew this was going to be at the scale it was now I didn't um at all. So I came in and became an owner around that in like when we started selling over the phone time. It was basically like handshake deal. Honestly, a lot of this has been handshake deal between me and Luke and me and Luke and the rest of the team. But um mainly me and Luke in that. So everything's been handshake deal and has always been good for in that way and now it's like all full. Um but yeah, so I didn't really know that it was going to be at the scale it was at all. It was that and it candidly I was doing a bunch of other stuff at the time. So I was randomly still I mean up until probably last year I was still doing and I still randomly do do like random stuff in affiliate, random stuff in lead genen. I've never gotten anything off the ground myself, but I have done a lot with other people who crush it. I have run other people's offers that have, you know, already have concept and proven and just they need more eyes on ad accounts. I've run those. I've done a ton of stuff in tech in affiliate lead genen world. I've done random stuff in ecom. Um some physical business stuff, but not really. Uh family has a a business in there, but I don't like to be part of that because I want to try and like tread my own path. Um but yeah, so at what point you dropped out to make it happen? I didn't. Um, so I went to uh college and was there for a year, but was in like class or school for the first semester. I dropped out right after the first semester, but I stayed in my dorm for the year because I had a scholarship program class that was 15 minutes every week and I kept that one, so I technically was still enrolled. Um, so I stayed there for a year. rough point in life. But in December, so before the first year was even or the first I think I said quarter, but half or whatever, um was over, uh I had already started up something in the finance world. So we were going to buy, we were basically trying to be like private equity. I didn't even know what that meant then. Um but we were trying to be an independent sponsor and do a deal that was a rollup of like an alternative fitness business like with physical locations that was in a franchise. Did a ton of stuff there. ended up actually moving out to California trying to make that work. I could talk a bunch of random finance terms that I didn't understand then and barely do now. But all in all, deal exploded after we got all the final approvals. We got financing for debt and equity stack, all of that. And then it all exploded and fell through in the final hour because the businesses we were buying had across the board like nine of 12 locations had a downtrend in their IBIDA on the trailing 12 and the deal fell apart. So that would have made me an cash millionaire at that time and I was probably 18 or 19. I was 19 at that point. Exploded and went home tail between my legs and basically started my live in a cave journey and don't be public about anything. So huge ego at that point. No skill uh a lot of yeah just not great. So that is when everything kind of exploded for me and then I started to learn the online stuff literally like the last week before I moved out uh from California and moved back home. So, and then yeah, just kind of curious background. Yeah. So, that's it. So, then there's a bunch of stuff in between there. Um, where I just tried online stuff of everything you can imagine, lead genen, affiliate, um, I was working, uh, I actually came back and was working with my dad's company for a little bit for like, you know, 30 grand a year or something. Um, for a bit and then a bunch of stuff bounced all over. tried all the online things, was making some money, was losing some money, just kind of no real anything there until I started doing some service work things like building websites, uh running small things for ads, doing ClickFunnels, like sales page builds, funnel builds, stuff like that. So, I could go deeper into that in another video, but I'm already 5 minutes into one question. So, uh would you like to go would like you to go more in depth into tracking sheets, end of day, scorecards, and templates? Um I can talk on those quick and then this is actually probably like a better full video. I have to figure out a way to Sorry, I'm looking at the data over here because um I'm gonna pull these up. But uh I it's very difficult for me to show these without showing like the literal exact exact numbers. I give you guys so many numbers and percents and dollars and things, but like to show these exactly is like I have partners and stuff and these like a lot of them go down to like net net numbers and stuff like that. But so for like the end of day example one of an operations we have gross rev net new versus active uh ad expense refund apps bookings new customers cost and then cost per across those and then so that's like across the top. So you're going to have like yesterday and then down here is the date ranges. Then you'll have a month-to- date actual and then you'll have a daily average. So that's basically like if we're seven days into the month it'll take that monthly uh month-to- date number divide it by the seven days. So you have a rolling average. Then the next one is the trend. So now that you have the daily average, if there's 31 days in the month or 29 or whatever, um you can then multiply by that so you see where you're targeting and then under that you can have a goal. So let's say you're trending 2.1, your targets three, you can then have up and down like red, green, if you're on track or not on track based on where you're producing for your averages. Okay, so actual trending or I'm sorry uh daily and then uh the trend line versus goal. So that's like a big one. And then we do that for month, we do that for last month, we do that for quarterly, and we do that for annual versus the prior uh same range. So like quarter over quarter, year-over-year, stuff like that. And again, there's other stuff in there like ad expense, like is that good or bad? If it goes up, you have to determine like where you're at in your business. If you're trying to drive your spend down, but get your rev up, which like you know, everyone is kind of, but at the same time, like there might be times and seasons where you're leaning into spend and you want it to be higher. So just making sure that you're identifying what's good or bad in your sheets. um end of day and I I think you're probably referring to the sales stuff. Uh we do end of day reporting. Uh we do a lot of time forms that then submit into like a globalized tracker. Um scorecard is a little different. And how I mean by scorecard is we actually have a manual one. Uh I automate everything, but we almost got to a point where certain team leads didn't understand their own numbers because they were so automated. So now we have them manually fill them in in a weekly ops tracker. So, it's basically just like the main KPIs. You can look up EOS is a big system for that. They have a scorecard and they talk about it. It's like the main KPIs and drivers that are important. They're tied back to the goals um that are both like quarterly, annual, whatever. Then they're tied back. So, like call it a $1,500 CPA. Then week over week, the leader of that KPI, so in this example, it' be marketing. We'll bring that to the meeting and we'll put it inside the tracking sheet. Everyone has to submit theirs before and then we uh live show it. they like basically talk about their metrics. So it'll go by like sales, fulfillment, marketing, whatever. And the only times it basically like lights up if it's out of KPI and it's like all right, what's going on with this? And you just kind of quick talk on that or dive deeper offshoot. So hopefully that was helpful. But I can probably build some templates. It would just take some time to build out and like candidly when I do these videos are just like off the rip. I don't do a ton of prep. I would have to like full build new templates um because I don't want to give away numbers just because like like that kind of number. um it's just too in-depth for what we're comfortable sharing. Um growing a startup biz, what do you look for in a head of people and how do you know a candidate is for acting ahead of people is good? Um so I talked about this in another video when I talked about talent acquisition. I basically said just get ahead of people and you don't have to do any of this. Uh because they'll do it and they're better at you than it. But so ahead of people for us was somebody that came from internal and that's kind of something we say is like we couldn't hire for this position better than this person. There's no way. Uh she's an absolute rockstar. Uh she came from within the business and was a coach. So did fulfillment then like quickly led to uh or grew into being the head of all of the coaching and then basically stepped up into like an operational role and we were still like all over the board on like what needed to happen at like an operational C level, whatever you want to call it. We were scaling from 12 to 30. We needed help um doing that. We tried to have project manager. She basically led a project manager. And what really kind of came out was like she's good with systems and like SOP and mainly with people, not so much like the project management side and like structuring it in that way. So I actually absorbed that portion of it. So I lead that and she is all things people and that's where she thrives. So like super high IQ, super super high EQ. So she'll do oneto ones with the entire team. She has relationship with everyone. So she's just like, you know, very unique, very unique person. So uh you can look into this. I know Gary Vee has one like a a chief heart officer like it's a common thing. So it's basically like I don't want to dumb it down and say it's like an HR director but like it is that bucket of people but like above that. So she has an HR director under her. So someone who does like the filings and the details and the payroll and stuff like that. Um but she is way more like future focused vision uh connecting with people on an emotional level as well as like a KPI level. Um compensation understanding across the board. So, it's basically a high level that uh in a lot of these small info businesses, you're not going to it's going to be someone who's just like has a high EQ and someone who's like emotionally aware and able to communicate with the people and navigate, keep the culture strong. If all of a sudden sales is low for x amount of months, like how do you keep the team there culture? So, it's that person. And generally speaking, that's going to be someone who is almost like partner level because it's just so tied into all of that that it's going to be hard for you to hire someone of that caliber that's not going to be like broken off with a higher piece of performance. So she is one of the people that is like you know one of the core drivers. She also leads fulfillment. So she leads all product cuz there's not just you know you don't need a chief of people for 10 people. So we have 110 20 whatever it is right now. And then you also she also leads all product. So you have basically fulfillment arm, sales arm, marketing arm, um sales, marketing, fulfillment. Yeah, basically those three core um and then tech but I kind of count that. That's me. But um yeah, so she leads that entire department. So yeah, how you got your start in info? um technically in info. So I bought that consulting.com uh program. Oh, I never even answered that up here. So sorry about that. Um but how I met them was basically how I started info too. So I bought that consulting.com program. So Sam Ovens who now uh owns and uh operates school. Uh so I bought his middle level program, joined it very quickly, realized that I didn't want to be the consultant expert face. I was not in a place and space in life where I would feel comfortable even doing something like this. And so I basically joined it, learned a bunch of stuff and then never did anything with it and didn't have like the wherewithal or understanding to realize that I could build it around someone else as the consultant. And he did. So he was building it around uh Nikki at the time. And he posted something in the group. I recognized his name from like other stuff when I was younger and like you know MLM life and those days. He was really uh top tier like distributor sales all that kind of stuff. So I recognized his name, clicked into his profile because he asked a question in like the paid community and he had just made a post that's saying that he was looking to hire someone, bring him on as a right hand and teach him all the things, marketing, sales, whatever. And popped on the phone and like quickly learned that like yes, I could learn a ton from this person, but we also have like a lot of uh we have a lot of similarities and a lot of different pockets of like expertise. So he and then as we scaled he is all marketing sales like he's CEO um of that and then she went into all product face I went into all tech systems ops but like the entire time understanding that we have so much overlap in terms of like marketing strategy like understanding of the entire business the entire ops of the business so we have a ton of overlap there but he like thrives over in sales marketing I kind of thrive over in tech systems ops numbers finance so yeah so how I got my start info was actually with them and I came in and literally was building like sales pages when they were doing monthly app and random like we I physically met them in person after working with them for like three or four months already. I was just like we all are full remote. We still are but they went to Bali and I flew out there and stayed with them for like a month in Bali and just we worked and built and gymmed and did our thing and that was when I got like full immersion of meeting them and I was seriously I mean I was getting paid like a thousand bucks every six weeks like Luke jokes in some of the videos it's like money came in, money went out, whatever was left like you know give Ryan some basically. Um, so yeah, it was we were strapping it um at that time and then we decided to take it over to the call funnel and that's when cash started like actually pouring and then that was the conversation of like okay cool now let's do some ownership and some like actual numbers of this. Yeah, that was probably 2019, 2020. Um, because it was over COVID is when I left Bali because I had to get out of there because country started shutting down. So, it was around then. But, um, sorry if you hear noises. I got a doggo in here. But, uh, how you made your first initial 1 to 10k and what you did with that to make more. Uh, I've never directly used money to make more money. That is something I don't have really a skill set in. Like the idea of, you know, your money makes money while you sleep. I don't really have that. Um, I've only built inside business. How I made my first initial 1 to 10k in life was like a service. I mean I worked for my dad doing like you know irrigation and shoveling sidewalks. He does landscape and snow stuff like that like in high school. So probably in that range is when I got I definitely got over a thousand. I don't even know if I got over 10. And then where I started making like actual money online was all service work. So it was building websites. Um I did some like actual in-person stuff. I'd build dashboarding units which is actually funny. And uh sold those to basically set them up as dashboards behind TVs. used to like build Raspberry Pies, put dashboarding software on there, build the dashboards, and then display them. Um, I know I was making like 10 20 when I was building those out. So, that but all of it was service work. Everything's always been service work. It's never been I'd never got affiliate and lead genen to crack to a level. Every time I got two, threek a day in spend and then something exploded and I just went back to doing service style stuff. Like, I never leaned into any of those. Ecom, same thing. like you know last fall we did I did 100k in a month just like messing around and it spent you know basically 99 or 105 or something like just break even. I've never had any of those directly do it because I've never stuck to any of them long enough. I've only ever done them long enough to understand like to itch my curiosity. So what I did with it to make more nothing. I joke around if you like see me on X I talk about the meme coining uh meme coin trading whatever stuff. I mean technically I have made a shell of cash in crypto but just buying big stuff and just like sitting on it but not like actively trading. I mean I've made like 100k in a day doing meme trading and then I've lost you know over a week and a half I've lost 100k. So it's like stupid [ __ ] like that but hopefully that answers that. Can you go into more details about the speedrun section of the learning skills fast and how you walked through learning a skill identifying good courses coaches and mentors? So yeah. So, in this video, it's called this exact um it's basically how I learn. It's like learning to learn. Um but in this one, I talk about how to speedrun it. You can pay instead of just like navigating your way for free online with YouTube YouTube and books and podcasts and stuff and how you can identify these. So um an example of this is I have bought I have another video called like gurus something and I literally have bought hundreds of I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on coaches courses mentors and even if it's just for like a little nugget because once you're at scale like learning a little something that can get you a one two 5% lift is like 10k 100k a million dollar you know whatever it gets it stacks. So you're it's always going to be more than the 5k course or the 10k this or whatever. So, um, what's an example of one where I did it? Consulting.com was a good one. Uh, when we decided that we wanted to go over to a callunnel, I bought the salesp process.io course because it was all about how you set that up on like the CRM side. I had no idea how to do that. The tech infrastructure, the pages, the structure, the funnel. And then I bought Alex Becker had a course at the time that was like a Trojan horse for Hyros that was very small um, and like tightknit. and it was around uh basically how to build the VSSL funnels and how to actually structure the VSSLs and then how to do YouTube ads. So I bought those two at the same time, literally got an Airbnb in Arizona, locked in during COVID for a little bit and we fully built it and went live in like 72 hours and that same funnel is what ran and we we got to like half a million a month or more maybe a million a month on that structure before we changed it over. Um so yeah, so just from that I literally just followed the blueprint exactly and did that. How did I identify that those were good? It's like, you know, it's like anything. How do you how does someone identify that your product is good? It's like case studies, results. Someone who's done the exact thing and is teaching you how to do it. Both Becker, both Cosmo at the time, like these guys had done the exact playbook, had built it, had case studies doing the exact thing from zero to this, and it was like that's the exact situation we were in. So, that one's kind of hard for me to like I get that question a lot actually, and I don't really understand how people don't know. Maybe it's like a gut thing, but it's pretty easy to identify for me of like who is legit and who is like full of [ __ ] Like it's very easy for me to identify. Um there's definitely some that are like, you know, whatever it is, smoking mirrors, but you can tell, especially for the people who do content, the ads and stuff can be a little more misleading, but if they have good results, good reviews, have been where you have been and have got to where you want to be. It's kind of like this simple framework. And then always knowing that if someone has done it, you can do it is a big thing. Uh there's all of this you can get you can get for free. You're asking specific how to do speedrun, but you can get all this for free. It just takes longer because someone who does it for paid, you're going to you're going to value it more a lot more. And you're also going to they already have structured out in a toz way as best they could uh in order to do so versus you boopping around to 19 different YouTube videos and trying to pick up on pieces and parts. So hopefully that's helpful. But what's your biggest bottleneck right now? And what exactly are you doing to fix it? I should probably go faster. money at 20 minutes, but what is your biggest bottleneck and have you tried something before you thought would work but didn't? Maybe it worked but not well enough. Uh biggest right now is sales. Uh and we are solving for it. So we just brought in that new sales manager I posted on X. Got a ton of feedback, found the perfect person who has the exact industry experience as well as um industry experience, scale experience, like just everything. So like of our bucket of our target market of the bucket of the uh level of scale we want to get to. A lot of people had, you know, basically maxed out at two, three, five million a month in their sales career in their as management. The last one we brought in had gotten to three before, brought us from one to three Rockstar, but like we capped at three and it's like, you know, sometimes you think that that's, you know, basically a cap of that, but he had other interests and other stuff. So, it was a perfect timing actually and he went off to go do his own thing. Um, so now we have this new guy in. How long it takes for this to work and back out, I don't know. um hopefully a couple weeks for it to start to take its like turn up. But we're already doing like right now the big thing is consistency around sales. And for a long time it was marketing. We saw that with the CMO. Um now we have sales was and the CMO implemented different like uh acquisition methods and models that are built for scale and restructure all the accounts to be built for scale. So I think we're ready there. And then the next thing that'll break will be fulfillment. And that's why if you see what I'm posting, I'm talking about buying these books and we're launching a back-end program and I'm just trying to like optimize my brand for understanding fulfillment because hopefully these two chief level marketing sales are so strong that, you know, my brain won't need to be there as much. So, I want to put it into the next bucket that's going to break ahead of time. Um, I have a mobile app in the women's beauty niche. Best makeup for you. What is a type of high ticket offer you're seeing work here? Um, I don't know a ton about apps, honestly. uh mobile app in the women's fit like best makeup for you. What is so when you think about offers a lot of the time like a very simple example is like done like a lot how a lot of people do this will be do it yourself done with you done for you as a scale of ascension through your offers. So like a higher ticket is back here lower ticket's over here um so best makeup for you I don't know what you're helping them solve other than understanding their best makeup like because what you're solving for is the result. So, like what are they what result are they getting doing it here on this low ticket where they just do it themselves? Like you're just giving them the information and they have to do it. Think about the craziest offer possible and getting that same result where they don't have to do anything where it's the fastest possible. It's the all these things. So like you fly someone to them, they try a bunch of makeup on. They do all this stuff. They pick it for you. They make it in this way and whatever, right? Like extreme. I don't know. But over here and that's 20 grand to do and your thing right now is $27. It's like that type of journey. So what is additional things and that's this is just with info. You don't necessarily need you don't nec I mean that's technically like more of service work. So like you just have to figure out what you want to bolt on because if you have what's the best makeup for you could you build an entire physical product makeup brand on the back of that and then do it that way. Like you know there's tons of review sites of what's the best makeup for you and then they just plug their own products or just get crazy sweetheart affiliate deals that they get you know paid for life on recurring stuff like that. So higher ticket though is generally going to be a done with you style or a done with you or done for you type thing. That's just the craziest thing you can imagine. And then just stair step it down until the fulfillment actually makes sense. And then it's like what's the highest what what are they trying to what is the result? What are they trying to achieve? And then make it as easy as possible and is them have the highest believability that they're going to get that result. So if it's look beautiful for prom, if it is whatever like I don't I don't know. I don't [ __ ] know. But you have to go there and then stair step it down to what you could actually fulfill on that makes sense margin-wise and is actually at a cost that people are going to buy that are coming from this. So as the ascension hopefully that was helpful but big fan of your content. Thank you. Especially how you manage and build your systems around growth and productivity. I'd love to see a breakdown of your notion dashboard and how you track everything from business to eternal. So I actually I've tried these before. I always get like lost in it. I go way too deep or I go like way too cloud. It's a big issue I actually have. So for me right now it's basically to-do lists. So I have them broken down by like categories. So I have like a personal list and then I have some stuff in there and then I have like the company names. And again like I said before like for a long time I was doing other side work because I wasn't as like it didn't need as much attention. We were running one funnel. We were running one thing. We were checking on the numbers. Like I have so much bandwidth and I was living in Puerto Rico so I had like you know 20 hours a day or you know whatever actually it is like 18 hours a day of free time. Uh, and then this was only a couple hours a day because it just didn't need it and actually did need it. I just wasn't we were I was not smart enough at the time to understand how to look proactively into the future and understand the numbers and understand where we were at. We were making great money and it was just is what it was. We just didn't have the vision for the company that we do now. So I had a lot of free time so I would do other stuff. So in my notion I would just break it down by different companies what needed to be done and then I'm like a calendar junkie. So everything that hits the calendar gets done and so I always used to break that out. Uh we use ClickUp internally. It's kind of like it's okay. Um, but everything I do is basically like database style view. So, it's literally just like grids and then across with like the relevant data across it. And then sometimes I'm a big fan of like waterfall. So, things that are basically like sub lists within those. So, I'll do that a lot of the time. Um, that doesn't work as well on a normal spreadsheet, but it does within like a ClickUp something. Uh, so yeah, I usually keep those and then run it all out of a calendar. But, I could I could probably make something and show you what I use. There's a ton of people if you want to go deep, but there's like 10-hour courses on YouTube that talk about notion and talk about like how to do these crazy setups and buy these, you know, thousand. That's another example of info people do sell those templates and make a million bucks a year just selling templates of notion dashboards they built and productivity systems. One of the big one is called uh lifestyle OS I think maybe or notion OS now. Um but that's a really good one. I know a lot of people who use that. It's like their dream board. It's like this is your daily task. It's your check off. It has templates. You dupe it and then it's the next day and it auto logs. There's a ton of stuff and a ton of people who are much better at that than I am. But niche selection. Um, so basically I assume this means like if you're starting from scratch, how do you pick a niche? Um, you want to pick something, it's kind of like double-edged sword, but you want to pick something that is relevant to you. Um, because you need to care about it if you're going to make it work. If you're going to push through when [ __ ] sucks, you need to like care about it in some way. For example, I have a buddy that is um like a was a D1 pitcher for baseball and we always like talk. We're like, "Yeah, you should do something in that." Cuz like he has a heart and soul for it, but like he's not interested anymore. So it's not as there. Um I have buddies that are super into hockey. I have buddies that are super into um like HVAC and services work. So focusing in there yoga like one of them has like a yoga teacher friend like all these things. So you have to be interested in it. Like I have you know I am interested in fitness. I understand the idea behind macros and strength training and these things. So like there is enough there. The other thing with niche selection is like if you can pick from anything like pick rich, pick one that's wealthy. It's easier to sell the wealthy. pick one that in whether that's in business or consumer. Um so picking a wealthier one, picking something that has ROI justification a lot of time is easier but not also necessary like fitness for example doesn't have ROI justification. You're not saying you know spend 10k with us and make more. It's also like an FTC thing so watch yourself. But um that is a nice one. And then yeah just overall market size. So there are different monetization models that will work on anything. So like for example uh life insurance. I helped a guy build a VSSL funnel for life insurance and he was uh an architect in his past life. So he picked architects because he could literally overlay that across everything. So it was like architect was in the brand name URL name. It was completely throughout the VSSL and like how he talked about it, the structure of it, how they talk about their angles and their this and their that and their designing and like everything. And then even down to like what the strategy session was called. It was like a I don't even remember what it was called because it was so deep in architecture language and it crushed. It was getting like $50 leads. It was doing all that stuff. They get on the phone and he keeps going through it and he's like, "Oh, wait a minute. Like architects aren't that wealthy." Like, you know, the.1% of architects are insanely wealthy, but like a majority of them are not. They make 55 grand a year. They do this and this. And his entire model was based around how you put like millions of dollars into whole life insurance and, you know, retire off it and that's how you get the big commissions as the agent and all that. So, it's like he picked the right niche that he understood, but he picked the wrong niche because they were not wealthy. They were not the actual ICP, they were not any of these things. So picking one that has a market size and that has an interest level combined is big is really big. I'm also not a super fan of like selling to info coaching which is kind of like you know my niche basically of this if you were to say what am I picking mine is seven eight figureure online business owners primarily info and coaching just because it's my world and I can talk about it and but what I'm trying to do is not sell them things. I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm trying to like meet people and like mastermind and basically like make friends and then also have a pocket of people when I'm looking to hire and when there's other opportunities like I'm potentially open to taking percents of deals and stuff like that into the future. right now like my bandwidth is tight but yeah I think I think yeah that that is not really that difficult of a question to ask to start um as you start to get into it if you like really think about it and picking one that's has a good market size and is uh good market size wealthy and you're interested in it right so hopefully that was helpful uh can you make video going over the ad tracking sheet or overall marketing data how you keep track of daily metrics from multiple sources and organize it all cost per blah blah blah blah. Okay, so for this you're going to have two. So first off, a lot of the time you do not want to store this, especially when you're beginning manually. I just don't um Well, actually that's not true because when you So you basically want all of your spend in one place. So you're going to use tools like Advonics or you're going to have a VA or somebody update this with your daily spend from the different buckets. So you're going to have your Meta spend, you're going to have your YouTube, Google, whatever spend, you're going to have Tik Tok. You're going to track those and put them in day overday. And then you're also going to live feed in the different like in this example lead app call uh call live show all those you're going to feed all those into their own tabs and then you are going to just go over ranges. So like yesterday you spent 10 grand, you got this many leads, you got this, this, this. Once you feed those in, you can easily divide across and get your cost per. It's super easy there. But when you start talking about multiple sources, this is where it gets a little difficult because if you are running things at scale, there is a ton of touch points. Someone is going to watch and click initially on Meta, then they're going to Google you and they're going to click on one of your branded search campaigns and click into the website, then they're going to book a call after that and then buy. It's like where did they actually come from? And that's a difficult question is like is it last click? Is it scientific which is like what happened within the last 30 60 90 what was their first click within the last 30 6090. Um so there's a lot of variation on that. Uh we use Hyros to actually look at the journey. Great great program. Kind of expensive now I believe. I think it's like I don't even know how much it is but it's kind of expensive I've heard. And then you can track this manually but you're just logging it over and over again. And you can't look across those different ranges except for generally speaking the first source because you throw it in as like a UTM parameter and then when you pushed it into your sheet on where the lead came from it would say that it came from this campaign on Google or this campaign on meta and then you would be bucketing it to that which doesn't give you the full picture especially at scale. So but it is pretty easy to do. Um you just you're just logging leads, apps, calls and then closes and then once you have those you can just pull back to the initial source. If you want to do it in a sheet, it's pretty easy. I can maybe go over that, too. I think I did make a video on this, like how you're going to pull them together. Actually, I know I did. It's like marketing 101 or something like that. Marketing V1 sheet. It's early on in the YouTube videos. You can look at it on this. If you look in this doc, it's probably right here. It's in one of these. Setting up a simple Yeah, this number six. So, ad spend sales. This one. So, if you look up number six, you'll see like a very simple version of how you can do it on a callunnel. And you can do that on everything. Um, how do you properly nurture leads before call that have the highest likelihood of a one call close? We have case studies of video testimonials, good sales process, find. Okay, so something is broken. Um, so if they are weary to invest, they don't believe you in some way. They don't believe that you're as legit. They don't believe in themselves that they can actually do it because they don't have the certainty. They don't believe that it's going to work for them. they don't believe that your case studies are real, right? All those things. So, uh we have case studies, video testimonials, and a good sales process. So, what we will do solve for, okay, solve for a lot of things here. So, first off, it's like, okay, they're booking. So, at what rate are they booking and is that a good number? Because if they're booking, they clearly like put out the time in their day. They're like, "Okay, I'm serious enough about this to book a call." So, if that rate is good, how many are showing? If they're not showing, you are not doing enough in between there to warm them and do that. I have a video going completely into this, but essentially you're going to have multiple different touch points before before they book and before and once they book, before they get on the call. So, we run Jeremy Haynes's Hammer Them strategy. So, we send them a bunch of like authority things as well as uh uh video testimonials, reviews, everything like that. And we push all of those on Facebook uh or on Meta, I'm sorry, on Meta to them basically based on a custom audience of people who have booked but not yet been on the call. And so we'll hammer them with those. And then we also send them emails. And then you also have a pre-frame video that is or pre-frame page that's like the thank you page once they book. It's like, hey, watch this video. Hey, look out for the email invite. Make sure you click, you know, unknown sender. Yes. Cool. Add to your calendar. Uh, watch these. And it's like three of the main pre-frame objections. And then it's just like a testimonial wall. So that's very important to do to make sure they have that. Then you're going to send them emails that are both content pieces as well as more pre-objection and testimonials. And then you're going to send them back to that page. you know, basically make sure they do that. Um, and then in messaging, you're going to have reminders to make sure that they do that. Uh, they go back to it. They're going to talk to somebody either triage or a closer or closer they got assigned with prior to it to basically confirm the call and make sure they have the information they need and the right people are on the call. So, you just have to do all that stuff to basically warm them so they understand that when they're getting on the phone, that's what they're getting on the phone for. Um, so I think that should help. And then yeah, basically just understanding where the drop off is and if it's a good sales process weary to invest like that's a financial objection gen I I don't know you have to tell me what the objection buckets are but like you can solve for that in the sales process too. So solve for the stuff before it it'll just make it warmer and then solve for this by finding out what those objections are finding objection handlers that work for those and then actually implementing them across the entire team. So hopefully that helps. uh talk about different ways you can build trust within your follow-up series and ways you've used things you I think it's the same thing probably the same submission right yeah probably the same thing so could you share more about tracking your finances your P&L and how you make capital allocation decisions yeah so we actually use similar to how I was talking about this marketing sheet up here we use this for cash flow too so we have one that's basically all inflows of cash and then it does all the marketing pieces so like what's new what's active um everything so we have all inflow and all outflows into a sheet. We're moving it actually over to like a database and proper viewer now that we're here, but we didn't this entire time. So, yes, you can run $30 million biz through a Google sheet uh with all the right zaps and automations. Um, so it basically brought in all the new then or all the all cash that was coming in and then was identifying what was new versus active uh what type and then also the sales rep commissions and stuff are tied to that. So, that all comes in and then all the outflows. So we have it then hooked up to our accounting software when there's new expenses or outflows that they would then push into the sheet. So we could basically have real-time cash flow across those and then do projections based on it. So in info and coaching it's pretty cashish like you need to understand like your collection periods. We don't have a ton of that but you need to understand your collection an example of like using pay plans how much money is to come into the future. And then also understanding that if you're, you know, collecting PIFFs and you have coaching, you have outflows of whatever $1,500 that you're going to pay a coach over the year in monthly increments or bi-weekly, whatever your payroll cycle is. So, being able to use those numbers to then project based on that. There's much like more legit ways to do this inside your accounting software and having someone do it. Um, I am doing a full overhaul right now of our chart of accounts and things to break it down by department so I can have department level uh budgets because I just want to make sure that we hammer that in before we go, you know, 50 100 million because it's important to me. So, uh, yeah, capital allocation decisions, that one is kind of here and there. Um, I don't really have anything that really fits in that bucket. Like if we were to develop a software, for example, like we do, we would completely budget that out. Talk about what like where we want to make that decision to do that. Will we do the expected return if we were to do supplement? Same thing. Um, but right now we haven't really had a ton of those. It's been majority just like cash flow style business where we just, you know, ate a lot of the margin last year scaling from 10 to 30 because we [ __ ] a bunch of stuff up just straight up. So now we know and have learned what we know and more stuff's going to happen again that we're going to learn. But hopefully that helps. So, and then how I track my personal is I actually use uh simplify and I've used Mint before that, but I just link everything. Almost everything that I have can be direct linked. Um, I don't put any of like crypto or stuff like that in there. But any of your cash accounts, any of your market accounts, uh, any liability or loan you'd have, um, any vehicle, any anything. You can basically link into those tools and then you can see your own personal P&Ls. I don't think that's what you're asking, but I like that one. And, uh, Sam from My First Million talks about this all the time. He has one that he uses that's more intense and he's, you know, in the high eight, whatever, I don't even know, in the eight figure range and he uses that and a bunch of people do in his company. uh join Hampton which is like a Vistage. So um favorite paid or free resource for learning how to scale a book a call funnel. I'm sure a ton of people have course on this. I actually don't know who's like crushing it right now in like teaching info like Ovenans used to. Ovens was a G about this. Um but free resources Jeremy Haynes he crushes absolutely crushes. He talks is like all he talks about is how to get to a million a month through call funnels webinar stuff like that but a majority of the time they're call funnels. And he leans really really heavy into the marketing side of things. So, he talks like funnels and like actual running the ads. And to my understanding, like he he might still run the ads. I'm sure he has people on his team, but like he understands it all at such a depth that you like couldn't get it elsewhere. Um, so yeah, his stuff is really good. And then he has a paid like mastermind. I think he has courses maybe still. Um, but he definitely has a mastermind that is all about this. So whether it's your marketing person or you as the marketing person, I know that's a great connect. Um, but book a call funnels are pretty simple. I mean, you can watch a lot of YouTube video stuff. Um, the core pieces are your messaging, your understanding of that and being able to, you know, properly have VSSLs and headlines and applications that qualify and then the rest is getting them on the phone and sales process. But the media buying side is huge or I'm sorry, more the marketing side, not necessarily the media buying, but the marketing side of it is big because what I mean everything that's happening there is messaging and understanding of that. So hopefully that was helpful. I will think and maybe talk about this or ask out and ask and see who's the best of the best right now or who's teaching this. So, love your content. It's a long one. Sorry. I would love for you to be able to help someone who's productizing their business from a standpoint of maybe they're hitting 100 to 200k a month already. Organic. Good. Their organic audience. Yes. Mainly on uh YouTube this. So, they've never paid ads before. They're heavily relying on things like shoutouts, affiliate marketing, referral marketing, going on podcast. And I was wondering if you could do more building out systems and process for that to scale. So, first off, that is traffic. That's like that is scalable depending on the niche. Like that could just be very scalable. It could either be more volume or more people. So like JVS, if you have two JVS and this is what you're getting, get four JVS or you know like it doesn't necessarily always need to be like paid ads in meta. It can be a lot of these. Uh Hortmozi talks a lot about this like the different types of traffic basically you can get and it's like one of them is paid ads and there's so many other ways and like J like full businesses have been built off just like affiliate partnerships. I think it's the partnership with the the company that does all the LLC's and stuff for like Pace Morby's stuff. Pace absolutely crushes it. Their entire business that he pushes over to the LLC company that does all like the company registrations and all that. And I think they do tax maybe too, but their entire business is all of JVS, all affiliates. They like don't do their own paid ads. They don't need to. And they still break on fulfillment. And like not in a bad way, like as in they're crushing it so good, they can't scale fast enough. So they crush. They crush. But it's all JV. You don't even need to do paid ads. So I guess you know when you should start running ads. Yeah. and you can hammer this further and you just know that like I mean if you know your numbers on this the thing with paid is you don't know your numbers as easily like you have to figure out your numbers and um but there's always a way to run paid ads like if you're already getting the source or information like traffic and stuff there's it's easy to just run retargeting for Google and Meta and just pick up like easy wins because there's people who are coming to your stuff from those that have not converted that you already you know have on your pixel assuming you have that. So yeah, I would set up retargeting for sure just cuz it's like easy land grab 10x row as minimum. Uh how do you know once you've got proof of concept, you know if this is working, I'm assuming, but I know you said you're not really an A to B. Correct. What would you recommend for someone who's looking to dial their sales, marketing, their operations, product fulfillment, also not having experience in software? I don't know if I understand this, but if you're talking about just how to grow it and you're already doing this, do more of this until this is like not feasible and productize this and systematize more so this so you can just double this or more. Run paid ads as retargeting for this and get another lift on this just from these sources, but you're using paid and then you already have pro proof of concept like it's working. It's selling. So, I don't know what that means. Um, and then what would you recommend for someone to dial in? sales, marketing, ops, and product. Refine it. Figure out what's working, optimize it, find the best buckets of things that are actually working. Um, and lean into them. And then also just find really good people. There's so many people in the space like that I've learned after posting all this stuff and hearing like there's so many killers in marketing. There's so many killers in sales and ops. And like depending on I was actually thinking about this the other day, but depending on what your goal is, like if you're not going to sell it, which again 99.99% like maybe we can't even sell, I don't know, but they don't sell. So, like if it's a cash flow game, it's just figure out your numbers. Like theoretically, you can build it in-house and have it cheaper than an agency. But if there are other models where you can work with an agency and you're going to get a higher return than if you were to do it in house and and that's what and based on what you c what it costs to do it in-house like in dollars and in time and management and like people and stuff. Like for example, in sales, we have like kind of mismanaged this and through people. So, we have like this huge team that then three people and W2 and this and that and whatever and like we need that because of where we're going and what we're planning on doing. But if we weren't doing it the way we were and it was focusing on cash flow, there's a guy that does it for 20% and they fully manage everything and like you know that they're the top tier. You know that they're actually going to crush it. So like their output is very high and you just don't have to think about it. It's like there's no very little mental strain and it's just you know the exact number in the check. So you can do that with sales, you can do that with marketing. Over time, you likely want to build it in house because you could get it cheaper and you'd assume that it could be better if it was like top tier because they would only be dedicated to you. But there's some sickos out there who could do all these buckets for you. So hopefully that's helpful on there. And then you don't have an experience. I don't really know what you mean by software. I guess whether that be from Revshare or you could say like private equity. Yeah, I guess that's my question. I don't know if you're asking me to do this. I guess whether that would be for more revshare, you could say. Um, if you're asking about these roles, yes, some of them could be I always do profit share, not revshare dependent. Um, unless you know your numbers well enough that like sales for example would be on like net new revenue. Uh, marketing would be generally speaking on cost or profit spread. So like new generated minus cost of uh spend and there's the spread and then they get a percentage of that. Um, operations is going to be profit and product is going to be budgeted slash profit kind of. That one that one's kind of harder, but so yeah, hopefully that's helpful. I don't know. DM me of that and I can answer your questions. So, 43 minutes. Sorry for going long. Hopefully it was valuable. I do all these videos every day. www.rroncl.comdoc has all the videos I've done. I think I'm on day 60 something. Um, and I sort them all by category. Tech, marketing ops sales, so you can filter and find them easy. Um, our daily update is, yeah, we're just cooking. We're just crushing on uh we're building on sales. So, that's the biggest lever right now. marketing has calendars full at good costs. Fulfillment's ready. I'm doing a big build out or actually the team is doing. I am not doing a big build out there and I'm trying to sharpen my axe and learn things in that space so I can provide some value and have like context and then hopefully distill some of that down to give resources to the team over there to find the right stuff because I don't want to just be like, hey, go read these 10 books so you know how to do this. I want to read them first and then understand it so I can guide if needed and ask for also and just stay within KPIs. So hopefully this is helpful. Um, I'll get back to some more detail oriented ones. I am out today, so I want to do this one early. So, talk soon, guys. X and IG for comms. Hopefully, this was helpful.

# how to 10x your output... (exact system) | E58
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtuhBoDdDBQ

In today's video, we're going to be going full guru and talking about high ROI productivity hacks. I'm a huge believer in the 8020 principle. So, we're going to go through the bare bone things you can do to optimize you, you your keys, you your keys, and your people, and you your keys, your people, and CCM. All right, these are all things I have actually done. This is going to be a funny one. So, let's get into it. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. And we've done 72 million in this business in total. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's begin. Now, again, I am a believer in some of this. I am not a believer in in parts of it, and I'm going to just walk through all of it. All right? So, if your mind and body aren't sharp, nothing downstream matters. And what I mean by that is literally I always say everything's a funnel. Everything's a funnel. You are the highest point of leverage. It's like if you have an opt-in rate that is a 10% and you get it to a 50%. Everything downstream has a lower cost per same thing with you. If you are optimized and dialed and getting the most efficiency out of you, everything downstream in how you do your work, how your personal life is, how your team is, everything is downstream from that. So, we're going to go over the basic stuff. Everyone talks about this. You can watch 92 other YouTubers talk about sleep for 5 hours. I'm not going to. So, sleep, very important. Same time. I cannot go to bed at the same time. I try and wake up at the same time. I am for five. That's my thing. Okay. Sometimes I miss it, sometimes I hit it. Aura. I used one of these forever and loved it and then just lost it somewhere honestly. Uh and it's super good at just knowing getting a baseline, testing things in your life and then knowing what kind of quality sleep score. I know people use Whoop. The no phone at night. I used to put it outside the bedroom door and literally not have it at all and then now I don't. Now I have it next to me and I probably need to stop that. These are just the basic things. These are the fun things, okay? But these are very important. So, son, I moved to I lived in the warmth for a long time. Um, or on and off, but I lived in Puerto Rico for the last 3 years. It was amazing. Had no social life, had no connection. Moved back to Michigan and now it's cold and it sucks and I'm miserable half the time. So, move somewhere where there's sunlight if that's important to you. And if it's not important to you, move to Alaska. Water, just drink a load. Just drink it all the time. Add LMTs, add electrolytes, do the things like just do the basic stuff to fuel you. Okay, this is very simply put. And then we're going to get into like the fun tactical [ __ ] Food. I always had like matt weird gut stuff. Whatever. It's youth specific. Some people thrive on vegan. Some people thrive on meat only. I eat like 90% meat or like protein specific. Probably higher than 90% just I hammer like three pounds of ground beef a day and like that's all I eat. That's all I eat for a long time. Now I eat some other stuff because I have like a social life and I mix it in. Um but then I started taking like random gut supplements. Oh, this is a side tangent, but I uploaded a bunch of stuff to chat GBT and it literally fed like put out all these supplements I should take and it was like fantastic and I feel great. So fun. But caffeine, don't drink it for the first hour. I wait like 30 minutes now, but don't drink it for the first hour and then stop at a certain time. A lot of people say noon, a lot of people say two. It depends on when you want to go to bed, but big help for the sleep portion. Use it sparingly. I don't really I have two or three a day right now, but supplements cover the basics. Do all the stuff you don't get in what you eat. Use specific. There's a lot of stuff that people have that are deficient in specific things. Literally just go get tests. Go get the full blanket thing of tests and just run it and then just do the supplements that you're missing if you can't get it in food. Nicotine. Don't be a degenerate. I have been a degenerate. I might be a degenerate right now. I probably would be considered a degenerate right now, but I use it for this. I use it to do these things and just to be on all the time, which is probably not ideal, but I'm in a season of that. Plan tomorrow. Today is a big one. Um, I used to do this all the time and I just actually recently started picking about back up. But basically fully planning it out. So I like live based on the calendar. So if it's on my calendar, I do it. So planning the next day completely ahead of time. So either the morning of or the best way to do it is the day before. I don't really like the week before because things change a lot. Um, but planning it the day before so you know what is blocked and where. And then putting in places to do deep work. So, for me, that's like 5 to 8:00 a.m. It's like my don't book with me time where like nobody's on. So, that's when I do the videos the best. Like right now, it's 5:00. Absolutely botched the day. Did a terrible job because I had nothing on my calendar. It's the first day and I don't know how long that I had no meetings, no nothing. And I even did end up having meetings, but I didn't plan around it accordingly. Didn't find the deep work buckets that I needed to do stuff like this. And then now we're here and it's 5:00 and on Friday and I'm doing this. So, not ideal. That's the general gist. There are so many things around this, but like optimizing you is huge. It's your environment, it's your inputs that then get the outputs. So, where you are, who you hang out with, like I could go on a whole journey of this. Uh, and I actually probably will at one point, but the U portion is huge. So, you really need to optimize you to just like where you feel the best, where you are having the most impact. Um, where your body, it's like mind, body, soul, right? getting those in alignment so that none of this other stuff, none of that part is an issue when you're trying to do the other parts of life, when you're trying to show up for other people, when you're trying to show up in work, when you're trying to show up in these other places. If you are broken in ways that you can fix uh or that you're trying to fix, doing that will help everywhere else. And that's just super important. So, now let's get into the fun stuff. So, you plus your keys. I always make the joke like, "Oh, if I'm I'm like clicking keys, is it the person doing the like clicking the keys?" And that just means like the maker verse manager. So this is more maker, this is more manager. It's like you actually doing the work, which is a lot of us and probably a lot of people who watch this is the people who are clicking the keys. Okay, so if you're doing the work, but this is a 5 to 10x faster through force multipliers. So here's some things I do. Learning to learn is a big one. So I made that video on there, but I have literally taken classes on how to learn. Um, and I think that's a big one. It's like these are all meta skills. So it's like things that you learn how to do that then apply across everywhere else and make you better at all those things. So it's very similar to like you if you are five times better as a person, you show up in all these other layers, five times better. So learning how to learn was a big one. Um I kind of gave a a rough framework of what I do. Some other tools and things I use, I'll use Whisper when I'm on desktop. Um I guess they just came out with the mobile app. we're just talking about with my CMO, but um whisper, so you can talk through to AI because when you talk, you give more context. You have like you're just willing to type or talk more than you're willing to type out when you're prompting. Um so that was a big one for me because I basically use it as like my full-on assistant um for everything for like my sidekick. Um AI in general, I use it in a couple places. I go on X and see how people use it in a million other ways. ways that you can basically this is all about optimizing how you do your work when you are the person doing it. So if you're video editing, if you are building websites, if you are running paid ads, if you're doing those things, opt finding ways you can optimize so your time is kept on the higher leverage opportunities and up here so you are the one pulling the strings more so than not. Mouse speed. This is like a funny one but so true. Like people go to touch my computer and I'll be like, "Oh, whoa." Like I can't even like navigate to where I need to go. I have everything maxed out on everything on mouses, on trackpads, on whatever. It's just like full speed. And it sounds stupid. It literally sounds stupid, but it's like if you're on a computer for 10 hours a day and it takes you this long to get to here versus like, you know, zipping over there, it is like they add up, okay? And that's what all these are then. So, typing speed, same thing. Take a class. Literally learn how to go type faster. I almost swapped my keyboard out for the WordPress founder. Um, Matt some Matt Mullenwig I think talked about how he changed his keyboard to one that was more efficient so he could type 30 or 40% faster because he was typing so much and it was going to save time. Like I almost did that. Instead I just learned how to type faster on my setup. Um, but like I literally took a course on that. I popped on UDI and like learned how to type faster. And it's like stupid [ __ ] like that adds up. Hotkeys. I have so many hotkeys. I have like uh Alfred on search. So like I'll pop that open and can search anything in the computer and like navigate to Windows. I learned all the native Mac keys so I can like pop things open. I use spectacle so I can move windows so I have it set to like three different things so I can have it split screen then this screen then this one on top and like do it like clicks like this. Um there's so many of these but like and then they're application specific. It's important. This whole video is probably stupid but like whatever. I don't care. It's it it can be important. So um best laptop possible. I always just upgrade to the best. I obviously like dangled a carrot on this one to when I got to 2500 subs, I'd buy a new one. But like now it doesn't lag. Now it's quicker on this. My emails just like boom. Like simple stuff. It's like I'm not out here like editing the craziest whatever like running these massive applications. I'm literally like 90% 95% web- based and just that being faster, getting the fastest internet possible at your house or wherever. Hardline in. Like if you're at a desktop, hardline in. Like it's stuff like this that seriously compounds that makes it so you never have downtime. You never like it's huge. So think about this in your own like zone. What can you learn to do within like I said video editing or web or whatever that can make you faster. These are the meta like how to use a computer better basically. Um because if you're on a computer 12 hours a day um double monitors this is like a highly debated one. Um Oans used to talk about this all the time and he'd be like oh yeah only have one have one screen have one tab open. have one, whatever. Uh, I don't abide by this. I have two, but I use a second one for like referencing. So, I don't actually like actively work between two and like drag things around like really at all. Um, so I guess sometimes it is probably more of a distraction if I'm like over here looking at this, but then also doing this. But I have plenty of times where I'm on a meeting and I have my screen shared, but I'm referencing something over here, or I am doing data back and forth and I'm like looking at one report versus another. And maybe if you had a bigger screen, you could do it, but it's basically the same idea. So, I just have two that are dedicated. I think that's a big one. Um, and there's there's a million things like this that live within you and your keys. And really what you and your keys means is you and your scope of work. So, whatever you are specifically doing, how can you be better basically at your job or do be more efficient at your job or optimize how you do your job in that way of how you are actually doing it? Because this next layer is you and your keys and people. So, now you're crushing it as you as a person. You have a great environment. You have great family friends that you see that like recharge then you you know have a great health. You have great uh you know spiritual like you have all these amazing things of you. Now you're doing your work at like the most efficient way possible for what you can output as an individual using some portions of AI using how you how good you are at it. Now you overlay the people. Okay. So now you stop doing and you start orchestrating number one thing here and then this is all just kind of like whatever but it's a players. So, hiring A players that then are on your team and almost like a SEAL team six vibe is the number one thing I could put on this entire thing. Like, I'm going to go through all these, but they say one A player is like, you know, three to five times what a B player is, and a C player is like a detractor. And it's so real. It's so real. And you can tell, like we just brought on this new guy, and like they're not asking as many questions. Like, yes, they want to get ramped up, but they want to do three hours of deep conversation about just everything and just kind of go around and then go crush their role. Um I just got on with the CMO and he's going through like you know 19 different variations of everything like just there are a players and there are not and you will know. So you are optimized you how you do your work is and now you have people that are doing the same. So, I actually listened to a hormone video about this whatever the other day ago. He was like, you know, trying to the number one leverage point you can have is basically getting people to do what you want, which is like not necessarily the best title or I don't even think that's what he said, but that's how I took it. And it's like you then have access to all their skills. You have access to then being able to like work through them. So, you have the intention, you have the idea, you have the plan, they execute on it and that just takes your throughput and just like just like makes it insane. So setting clear ros and clear roles and having clear KPIs for them major KPI drivers I think is huge. I have other videos where I talk about this in like a little bit you know a management light basically SOPs around stuff that you have built up here that is like specific that you need done a certain way a lot of time a players will then you know basically come in and be able to monitor their own KPIs that you've set set their own SOPs unless there's stuff that's company specific dashboards huge. This then all kind of turns around into like how do you build the around the A players a machine because the whole goal here is you're growing a machine and what we're optimizing for all of this is optimizing for basically like crushing it in like online business more or less or business while being trying to stay great you and yourself and how you want your goal to be. So dashboards, meeting cadence, communication, delegation, all of those exist within trying to find the points of leverage and basically create recurring machines within them. So dashboards that are automated that drive KPIs like and like the whole point of that is to automate it. So instead of someone coming together and pulling together dashboards and someone else not knowing their numbers so they don't know how they're doing in and in like these downstream effects the goal is to find the root of it which is like automate the KPI throw it on a dashboard gamify it so they're trying to reach the next layer get under the threshold do whatever okay meeting cadence structured exactly at the same time this is what it is this is what we cover you pushing things down the road instead of having scattered communication and scattered conversations around what the deliverables are what the plan is, where we at in terms of the plan, all that. Communication, bucketing your communication and streamlining it so there's dedicated channels or whatever that you're communicating in that are for specific things and making it so people aren't in all the one channel talking about 92 different projects or not. Delegation, trying to find, it's actually kind of the other way around, but like things you cannot automate, you delegate. And I think that's from uh Tim Ferrris OG book probably. But basically trying to figure out a way to delegate things out only that you can't automate. So automate everything you can to like save the people from having to do it and then delegating out like the actual like core parts that are at this point basically just thinking, strategizing, planning, and executing on things that a you know computer more or less can't do or cannot be automated. So, general gist of where we're at, you number one thing here. This is again if your goal is to be throughput maxing and basically just trying to like optimize everything. If you want to like Oh my god, I cannot believe I didn't put this on here. You know what else you don't do? You don't party and you don't drink like an idiot. That was me. I was aing idiot. Don't do that. It is like night and day. You get back like you have like five hour five years in a year now. It's like you just reclaimed like 30 times more time. So that's a key there. But you number one thing optimizing for your goal. You plus your keys and how you work. You plus your keys and who works with you and how you guys build together and delegate through. And then this last one is what we talked about yesterday. Code media capital. You detach completely and scale without limits. I tried to be dramatic. Um so this idea being that you know people are then at some level limited to and how much throughput they can have. But things like code, media, and capital are not. So code meaning the software can scale to whatever if you were to be put inside software. It can scale infinitely. Media, you having a conversation onetoone with somebody versus it being able to be shared one to 10 million on a video. Same thing with like paid ads kind of falls in that media bucket. And then capital being able to leverage money in order to do that. All coming back to you. So focusing on you, focusing on how you do your work. I have like 90 of these that I could go through on what we do there. Having the people within your team that are a players and optimizing around them and how they can best do their job and then teaching them how to become the best for themselves or helping them, not necessarily teaching them, but helping them determine how deep they want to become at optimizing themselves because then you're just, you know, creating a flywheel then teaching and helping them how they can do use their keys the best uh in whatever their role is. So how they can be optimized in their position and then layering in where you can get leverage with capital through OPM where you can get media leverage simple in training but you know one to many of trainings code where there can be software implemented across these layers to make it so people's jobs are easier where they don't have to do a certain piece or more efficient not necessarily easier and yeah so hopefully this one was helpful um this was kind of funny to me but my girlfriend and I literally will play like that overcooked game or something once I'm off a computer for 14 hours a day. We'll just jump on that and uh we'll play and it's like all about like how quick and optimized you can go between things in like this kitchen and I literally will like I think like that now. I will seriously I'll go to like make something in the morning and if I didn't start the coffee first I'm like oh I'm all out of order and it's it's just funny. So this is how I think about everything. All about throughput, all about funnel, all about what gets from here to here, you know, if you can optimize the funnel throughput. So hopefully this was helpful. um daily update all these docs www.ryclog.comdoc ryancloud.comdoc. All the videos are inside here sorted by category. Tech, marketing, sales, operations, whatever is relevant to you. You can filter. Um, and then you can see like the main idea behind all of them. We're doing good right now. Um, not great, but we're doing good. So, we're on the up and up, but we're not anywhere near where we need to be. new sales manager is in doing a bunch of stuff on the financial front and getting like department level KPIs and like P&Ls built out so that I can basically be ready because last time when we scaled from 12 to 30 a lot of things broke and profit slipped. So I'm not going to let that happen this time. So I was not on it nor was I privy to the numbers that I should have been and now I am. So I'm locking in like things like mar uh marketing entire team budget basically as a percentage of net new cash. um optimizing things like how we're doing fulfillment and the um basically what I shared in those videos talking about the the margin percentage there or like what portion of net new or not even net new but what portion of the coaching like rev can be broken off into the bucket there and then what they can get in bonuses and pools there. Um and yeah, basically just across the entire company. So we're breaking things into marketing, sales, fulfillment, and tech. Tech is kind of an overlay, but I am close to heart on that one. So, we're going to have those as four operational meetings that we're going to have now instead with department heads with their own meeting agendas and their own setups and their own project lists. So, that's something we've never had before. And yeah, just a couple other things, but yesterday we did 60 I want to say. I think we did 60. Wasn't a good day. We did like 120 and then we did like 60. Yeah, 62. So, 120ome and then 60some and then today we're basically on pace for in between that. So yeah, things are going all right. I appreciate you guys as always. Hit me on X, IG, wherever. And let me know if this was fun or helpful or if it sucked. So talk soon. Right.

In today's video, we're going to be exploring the question, how deep can you go in your business? We're going to be using real life examples like affiliate, lead genen, insurance, and real estate. Talk about the different levels of depth each business model can go. Talk about the different leverage points you have to reach these levels and then how your lifestyle changes as you reach these different levels. So, by the end of this, your brain will be turning on how deep you can go within your business and if you even want to. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million over now in cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work for us, and what we're actively doing now to scale to 100 million a year. All the goal of finding top talent opportunities and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Now, this all came from a conversation I had yesterday and it was specific to real estate. So, I am going to dumb this down. This is not an exact. This is not the only way this goes and I'm going to talk through that as we go. But, let's kick this off. So, let's talk affiliate, lead genen, agency, info, SAS, insurance, and real estate. Now, the idea behind what I'm getting at here is you can go as deep or as wide as you want, literally in any direction with these different business models with anything that you do. Okay? So, let's use an affiliate as an example. And again, I am dumbing this down and I will explain through that. So, as an affiliate or lead genen, okay, and I'm gonna use exact examples. You can be a media buyer and run mass amounts of affiliate. You can then scale up, level up to an offer owner. From an offer owner, you can go to a network owner that has many offers. And then from a network owner, you can become a software owner. Now, let's use an exact example. Adam Young, who's on the podcast or on podcast on on video on this YouTube, uh was talking about how he went from being a media buyer to essentially an offer owner to then being part of many networks to then owning a software that all of them run through. All of this is an example of saying how deep can you go within the business model you're in. anything that you do and this is like direct quote basically from Horamoszi as an example and he uses garage doors I think in the one he talks about but it's like any business can be a hund00 million business most businesses can be a billion dollar business and only a few businesses can be trillion dollar businesses for example okay so meaning that you can be installer you can be someone who's on a crew installing a garage door you can be the person who owns the garage door installation company you can be the person who makes the garage doors you can be the person who owns the company that makes and install calls them and then you can be the conglomerate across the entire country, country, entire world that does that ex exact thing. You can do that within garbage. Let's use insurance as an example here. I know somebody who's a life insurance agent. One of the first times we had a conversation, it was okay, so like what's the next step? So, do you want to do because there is depth within the specific role? So, an example here with media buyer, before I go back to insurance, somebody who's a media buyer, there's a big difference between somebody who spends $1,000 a day being uh, you know, solo affiliate basically, and somebody who spends $600 grand a day, $2 million a day across different offers. Right? This is where you get into width. It across different offers or in one and goes extremely deep. Okay, so back to the insurance example. What was the goal of the insurance agent? Was it to then be an insurance agent and write a million, two million bucks? was it then to have a team under him either admin or other agents would be the next rung. There's online guys not to be you know doxed or named that are insurance agents that then now recruit other people to join their thing and like almost MLM kind of get the override on them for bringing them in. So now you're skill stacking where you are now recruiting people in. You're teaching the thing that you know how to do well and you're making overrides on them while also being a producer. So there's that layer. The next is you own the entire group because you are a cog in this wheel and you now own the group that has multiple of you which requires a different level of skill which is managing the people which is the entire legal department which is the entire you know that then are you one of the insurance companies of the products you're selling? Do you own credential and are you them and then you know however far you can go beyond that are you the bank that then finances behind them? are you like the wrong in which you go can relatively be infinitely scaled. Okay, and that's that's the entire concept of today. It's not to say affiliate or lead genen, you know, it's only these because it's not it's not just media buyers, it's not just offer owners, it's not just networks, it's not just softwares. There are rungs and levels of depth you can go within all of these. Okay, so this is stolen from Naval. So smart. And then another hormoney one. He changed these to all C's, I think, in one of his. But the essentially the points of leverage you have are labor, capital, media, and code. Okay? So like in real life, what that looks like, labor is like more people. So the insurance example is you're having more agents sell for you under you. Same thing in a real estate example. You're a real estate agent. You want to then go up to a real estate broker. That's actually the example I use down here, but talking about lifestyle. So labor is more people. That is a team. That is essentially that, right? It's like you have a factory, you now have more people making it. If you're making a widget, you now have 100 people under you that are making the widget for you. Capital two-sided one, but OPM. So essentially, either your capital is working for you and providing leverage or you are using other people's money in the same way to provide leverage internal. Okay, so the idea being that your money can work for you or within confines of you using someone else's money for max amount of leverage. media, the idea that content and how it is produced can spread at like an exponential rate. And instead of you having a conversation once, it's like the VSSL idea. It's like you having a conversation or doing a sales pitch one time versus that one sales pitch going to a thousand or 100,000 or 10 million people is the same. It's and from one to one now goes to one to many code. The idea being this cost that's here. There's no labor behind it. There's not it doesn't require any of these things. It's very low cost. Not no cost. It's very low cost and it has infinite scaling ability. So that's your software, that's your networks, right? You you can stack these on top of each other. So let's go back up here and go to agency model and I'll talk a little bit on like depth versus width because I'm trying to cover a lot of things here. But idea being I know here actually even better example there is somebody in info that I was talking to that for example was selling everything to women. Okay, they got to a couple million bucks a month and said, "Perfect. Now I'm going to take the exact same service, basically rebrand it and send it and sell it to men. Okay, making 2 three million bucks a month, crushing it. Easy opportunity to make a couple hundred grand over here doing this." Now, that is going wider. There's overlap, no doubt. It's not like they're going to start like a painting business and they're over here doing, you know, a women's, you know, supplement, whatever company. But the depth in which you could go to sell to a market of women for a specific thing is so vast that like your brain cannot comprehend it. Okay? So I'm using this as an example but in our business for example like you don't no one would even know who we are if we're doing hundreds of millions of dollars. like you're talking like it is so small of the market that I often question and I have this conversation with myself all the time and that's kind of why I'm talking about this is how deep can you go in something? How deep do you want to go into something and how much does it change your life if it does either in the positive or the negative? Because there are major different things that happen, different skills you need to stack, different types of leverage you need in order to get to these other levels that then change your lifestyle vastly in a good way and potentially a bad way depending on how you do it. Okay, so let's use real estate as an example. These are three simple. When I put real estate up there, I was actually thinking about something else and I'll and I'll go into both. But for real estate, you can be a real estate agent. You can then be a real estate agent brokerage. So you have all the agents under you. So you have the labor, right? Leverage. Or you can be a real estate software as an example. This is a bad example, but an example. So you can have the code behind it, right? So instead of having to have a thousand agents, maybe you have a thousand agents and you have code now behind you. And a lot of time a brokerage you have media behind you too now because you're doing at scale. But the skills needed to do these different things is vastly different. Now think about the lifestyle of what a real estate agent is that's a high producer. Okay. How how many hours are they putting in? How many drives are they doing? How many showings? How many like how many things are they doing? Now a broker imagine what their lifestyle is. They now have all the people management. They have constant you know marketing basically for the overall as well as to get new people. So they have acquisition of people. They have acquisition um of leads that then come in that then they funnel down but they make their percentage there. So is that a better lifestyle? Up to you. The real estate agent has basically unlimited freedom to want to work when they want just get commission when they don't. A brokerage is a full-on business in that way. scale step up to a software and the headaches and the amount of things and the different types of management and team the marketing of SAS the uh engineering of SAS and then having depending on what you're doing B2B versus B TOC is this consumer level real estate is this B2B uh real estate now you have an entire sales division for that that you're selling you have constant product iter like the level of skills that you must stack in order to do that think of a sales rep there's a sales rep that's on your team they want to sell they make their commission they're cool they clock out when They're done. They're done. Go to the next layer. You have sales manager that then has all the sales people under them. Makes override. You have people who run sales agencies. You have people who run entire sales. Like it just everything has depth and you can climb up ladders of them. The question is if you want to. The question is if you know that it's there and have the perspective to say, "Okay, wait. I can I can stay a media buyer." And it's so oversimplified. These guys are some of like the smartest guys I've ever met. So like it's not to say it's the bottom of the rung, but like you can be a media buyer and have a couple other media buyers under you. you never really hit the offer owner and you can spend a million dollars a day at whatever margin you want to call it across these guys because they went so deep in it. Another example, somebody was running um ACA, so the the health, right? Uh lead genen style thing. So affordable care act, you have media buyers running it. You have like every piece of the of the transaction. You have media buyers running it. You have agencies that then are a lot of time over the media buyers in in some cases sometimes through solo lead genen. You have brokers that are between them that are brokering the deal. You have the call center section that's taking in all the leads. You have then who is the actual like buyer of them. So what insurance middle, right? Then you have the actual and then you have like freaking government right on the other side of it. So as an example, but like it's you get to choose where you sit in the supply chain version of this and at different levels you get different depth. The the different depths of those have different returns, have different lifestyles you have and and and it okay. So, the entire concept of this is somebody messaged me yesterday and was talking about it and then I had a conversation at dinner that was around real estate on how they bought a piece of land. They basically demolished it and somebody came and bought it right there for like double what they paid. I was like, "Oh, that's interesting. Okay, why?" The next step of what they did was that person then went and got permits and doing all the things they needed and the I forget the exact word but some government like licensing thing that this was swamp land and they basically got all these grants back and they saved over half the purchase price right there in credits then developed a ton of multif family on it. This plan to do develop a ton of multif family on it and then they will either hold or then sell it. So up that food chain you have somebody who in the transaction was a real estate agent. You have somebody who just bought land or for another idea, somebody who then did the permitting and licensing who then had double the value or assumed value on it. Then you have somebody who's going to develop on it and have it as multif family. And then you have someone who's either going to hold that, which is that person, or is going to sell that to someone who owns 400 other multifamilies, all from that same chain. So, how deep do you want to think into what you're doing? How deep do you want to go within your market? How deep do you want to go within your business model? How how many skills do you want to stack? and what points of leverage do you want to use? And I think about this like so often it's actually annoying. Um, and I don't know, I just felt like I need to make a video about this. So, pros and cons. A lot of the time, the simpler ones are more transactional. So, a lot of the stuff in media buying, for example, it's like money in, money out, right? Everyone says it's like the simplest P&L. You spend on ads, you get back commission. That's what it is. Not as simple as that, but like it's leans in the direction of that versus somebody who has equity who builds something up. the guy who is doing garage door installs versus the person who built the entire company that creates the garage that you know manufactures the garage doors and has install teams and whatever has equity has a business that can sell. So in that model even you know they're obviously making more per like on dollars. Yes, but like the amount of leverage that they have is then also able to exit. Okay. They can also get a large sum for selling the company in their business. Same thing with info. Info you can just go transactional. You're selling a PDF. If you're selling a low ticket and you're doing it for cash flow, are you doing it for an exit? Because you can't sell that. You're not selling that ever, right? You need recurring, you need continuity, you need team, you need traffic distribution, you need no founder risk, you need like all of these things. You need proper accounting, you need prop like everything in there. So, how deep do you take info versus being an affiliate that sells somebody's info product versus owning an info product versus managing a large scale info product that has multiple products uh SKS? Then there's the question of with at any point are you going to go and be someone who then splits that and is now selling to multiple markets and doing this and different niches or whatever. Are you going to go so deep in there that you have multiple SKs, you make money from everywhere about it and you have such a full-fledged team, such a full-fledged distribution of how you're doing acquisition, how you're doing fulfillment, how you're doing like everything that it is such a machine with such future consistent cash that you can sell that thing for 5x, 10x, like whatever the number is. Okay. And across that whole thing cannot keep saying on this the skill stacking that is required and how you must level up as a person is like this in order to do these things and here simple verse simple there's a roadmap for all these you can look online you can talk to people you can whatever somebody in your exact same spot in your same world or very similar to it up 2% different has done this to a million a month 10 million a 100 like insane numbers within your zone. Okay, they might be doing it in a different niche that's slightly related. They might be doing it with a different traffic source that's slightly related. They might be doing it in something completely different but the model exists. So it is simple simple in terms of it is like the the road map is laid out for this for this for this for this. How hard it is is completely different than how simple or how easy it is to explain. Okay. though I can talk game about this and that and whatever and like all these are my examples. Not saying I have done or whatever I've gone to any level of depth within any of this, but there's always something I'm thinking about is like how far can we take this or how far do you want to take this? Do you want to stop at where you're at and just go deeper within kind of the place you're in? Or do you want to try and level up within there? Do you want to level up through labor, through capital, through media, through code? And is that a lifestyle you want to live where now you manage people or now you manage systems or now you have people that manage systems and you manage those people like do you want to have your capital out and using it on return? Do you want to be taking other capital so you can leverage it because of your operational and like your return the ability you are uh you have to get a return like there's all these different games that get so much bigger and yeah it's just interesting. It's just interesting to me. So I hope this one was kind of helpful. Um, it's just like a thought exercise that I think everyone could do a little more of. Just thinking bigger. Just how big can you go? How big do you want to go or how deep do you want to go within your sphere? Um, and yeah, I think that can be helpful. So hopefully that one was helpful. Yesterday I talked about, you know, how I learned things and had some questions that were similar to this and then had a conversation that was basically about this last night and I was like, I've definitely never talked about that on here. So that's that daily update. I do all these videos every day. This is like day 60 I think. I actually have no idea. And if you go to www. have to use that, put it on ClickFunnels. This is my OG funnel hacker shirt. Just left the gym. But uh for doc will have all the videos, all the different categories they're broken down into so you can easily filter. Um daily update on the company today, actually the May 8th. Uh we just launched a new sales manager to the team. So we did a complete passover from the one that was with us from 1 million to 3 million a month. Um and back down. By the way, we're at, you know, 1.5 or 1.6 six last month. So, uh, new sales manager is officially in. Uh, two of the last three days, we've done over 100K a day in new. So, that's good. So, we're like right there. Now, we just need to implement all this and actually execute on what we're doing. Um, or what the plan is more so, and we'll be off to the races. So, I'll do some more updates with what we're doing, funnels and and tracking and math and things. But, I just thought this one would be interesting. So, drop some feedback, comments. The comments crack me up when you say some of them. So, keep those going. And then yeah, hit me on X or IG.

# the exact process I use to learn SKILLS fast ($72M+) | E56
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faq6SSgd0FU

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the process that I use to learn anything fast. This is the exact framework that I have used to learn countless different skills that have generated tens of millions of dollars. We're going to walk through how you can do this for free, how you can speedrun your way through by paying using GPT as your partner, and so much more. And the entire time, I'm going to be walking through real life examples of how I have applied this in the past and how I'm doing it today. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now crossed over 72 million actually in total cash collected. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on the channel is sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So let's get into it. So first things first, identify. Now all this is my opinion. This is how I operate. This is not necessarily the fastest or the best way. It is my way. So identify. First things first is defining the actual outcome. So there is different ways to look at this on if you're optimizing for a goal, a result or just the skill itself. And I think it's very very important to identify what you're actually targeting and then reverse engineer that result. So there's a lot of different examples of this, but it's just really important that you focus on what the actual result is, not necessarily the model or the method. And that can be very confusing when you're optimizing for a skill like how to run paid ads when what the actual outcome is is what you want from running the paid ads. because there's then there's different methods, there's different skills that you can learn that can do that and also higher leverage ones. So, how I like to approach it is always finding who is the best, who is actively doing it and who was you in their past. Okay, so what I mean by that is basically now that there's I have X and all that kind of stuff. Before it was just YouTube searches and looking all over the internet or where you get ads and finding who is the best in this specific space. So in the example that I'm using for this or what we did was I basically wanted to find who was the best in the callunnel space and then learn from them. Okay? So try to identify them look online. Now you can use Chad GBT that didn't exist then when we did this and then who is actively doing it. Now what I mean by actively is not somebody who is teaching you how to make money and they're making money by teaching you how to make money and like this vicious loop. It's very common now um and especially in the online uh the internet marketing online space. So, you want to find someone who's actively doing it likely or is freshly doing it. Uh, who's still in the trenches. So, there's people like Iman who've talked like, you know, they stopped selling agency stuff when they stopped running their agency and they said, you know, they're not the best or the one who's actively doing it anymore. And that's what I mean there. So, who was you in their past? This is also a very important one. Um, if you look at somebody who's operating, you know, who's a billionaire right now and operating in this way, one, you can't just operate like how they are and get their result because how they did on the way up is different than where they are now. Okay? So, being able to find someone who has a similar past or has a similar experience that you have now uh is very important. So somebody with a trust fund versus somebody who you know doesn't come from money are going to have a different version of how they can do things because they have different resources, they have different experiences, they have a different environment. So it's it's very helpful to find somebody who came from a similar background or has similar skills or is in a similar industry um than not. And then sanity check. This is just a quick like again why am I learning this or why is this important to me or is this the real outcome of what I want and constantly kind of doing that sanity check as to who you're listening to and why you are defining this as your goal. Now, immersion is the free version. YouTube books, newsletters, podcasts. Um, in the examples of here, what I'm talking about for this MR community, like right now, I'm hyperfocused on how can I learn about the best MR communities that exist. So, how they do framing, how they do activation, how they do gamification, retention, all these things are like super important to me because we're launching one. And I'll get into how you can have like some higher leverage on these. But the first thing I'm doing is just eating alive. Anything I can find on YouTube, I posted on X yesterday. I'm buying all the books. I will skim through, I will read, you know, aggressively through ones that I like. Um, I will try and find newsletters where it's all that people talk about, both there are free and paid versions, different podcasts. Like another example of this is, you know, I wanted to help my mom create a recipe blog when she was in retirement. And all I did for like an entire weekend or more was find all the YouTube like every YouTube video about, you know, recipe blog SEO, um, every newsletter, every podcast, like there's a recipe blog pro or something like that. And I still have the podcast to this day on my phone where there's hundreds of episodes about SEO and photography and all these like just immerse yourself. Okay? So, you're going to want to be around the people and you're going to want to be around the people talking about it or watching the people talking about it. Now, the speedrun, I made another video on this like course junkie guru, but the difference with speedrunning or paying for it is one is you're going to value it more. So, it's not just going to be some side hobby. And two, you're going to get the structure. So, the idea with someone ideally, and again, this is going back to like who are you listening to? who are you listening to because that's so important. But get you get the structure that sometimes doesn't exist on YouTube. Same way that if you were paying somebody to, you know, learn how to learn um there would be a better way to do this than this YouTube video. Like you're going to pick pick up nuggets and pieces, but somebody else has thought this through and created a 100 hours or spent a 100 hours creating content around this in a very structured way that has like proper checkpoints and activations because it's a paid course. Ideally, again, you need to pick the right ones. Um, but there is a lot of value in paying for it and skipping the line. So, courses, coaches, gurus, uh, huge fan of this. I think, you know, it's a pay-to-play game. Sometimes there are lower ticket ones, but like name somebody who's the best of the best that doesn't have a coach. Like, you can't. And coaches are a little different because sometimes they haven't actually done it. Like, you know, the Michael Jordan, you know, has coaches that haven't been Michael Jordan, but there are aspects of what they're getting from that person that they're world class at that they're the best in the world. Okay. So, like you can piece and part skills and pieces from people. You're going to have a course creator or a coach or somebody that crushes it and teaching you something about business, but they might have a terrible family life. And like you need to determine what pieces and parts you want to learn from them because you don't need to be them. Okay? So, skipping the line. You get to learn what didn't work when they did it. A lot of the time like the real ones will talk about what didn't work or what they tried. And if they were only doing one thing, that's usually not a good sign. um what does work, so what they've leaned into and found pockets, the math behind it, like they need to know it better than anyone. How they think uh is a big thing. So, not just listening to what they say and the content, but how they're thinking about situations and and and structures and then also you learning how to think. It's kind of like the metal uh meta example, and I was going to make another entire video on this, but there's so many skills that you can learn that then fast forward everything else. So that's everything from learning how to type faster to using AI to um you know proper speech to leadership stuff like any of those kind of like more meta skills in you as a person and what you do on a daily basis like just speeding up your mouse is going to make you 10% faster and like you start stacking those together and it sounds stupid but like if you're on a computer 10 hours a day and you can go faster and your computer doesn't lag and this and this and this like you just gain 10 or 20% of production. Now you have to make sure you're working on the right things. you have the right skill, you have all that stuff, but like there's some foundational blocks you can work on. So, important to know how they think and how they're structuring things. And then again, caution level one, level 10,000 on this. Gurus, do not follow the guys who make money teaching you how to make money. Like, there's a place for it, but and I've paid them and I've learned things from them. So, I'm not going to say that they don't have great there there are nuggets in there, but I don't know. I'm just more of like an an expert. I like to find the experts. I like to find the best of the best and they also put out free content that you can consume. So, and then mentor levels 1000. That's just circling back on this. Every top book, every top person will talk will tell you that mentors are the best thing ever. I think of mentors a little differently than I would think of courses. Uh but a mentor is someone who more so just exists in your life and in checkpoints to basically like be a guiding guiding light of that. And you're going to pick up more nuggets that are like ancillary than just the core thing, right? It's not where you're buying a course and you're learning the A to Z on how to do this. It's more so the evolution of it and checkpoints through u but mentors continuously like over time is the best way to learn something and like elevate your your view on things. So now let's get tactical how I use GPT as a as my partner in this. So I will prompt it like a researcher. I will come in and say act like you're the best copywriter in the world. Act like you have done, you know, XYZ. And it's only getting better right now. So if you can position it well, create one big thread and then give it context, context, context. So for example, of what we're doing here with this MR community, I did a massive uh brain dump. Again, back to the little meta skills, but like being able to audio talk into GPT versus type is like 50% lift. And you get more context because you kind of like yap in circles. And just that alone gives you gives GPT more context and can feed it back versus what you're willing to type or going to spend the time typing. So context, context, context. I was like, you know, here's what we're doing. I want basically actually how I started yesterday, for example, was I said, I want to launch this uh paid basically subscription community. I want it to be the stickiest thing ever. I want it to like, you know, the best reviews, the this and that. It gives me like this insanely good output. And instantly I was like, wait a minute, this is for someone who's just paying this. I want it in my specific context, in my specific case, to be on the back end of another product skew, so call it like a high ticket. And then afterwards, they're going to be in this low to mid tier ticket that is recurring. And we want it to be like life focused, like forever focused. Just giving it the context of those changes. You're going to go from here to here. It's actually like a downell continuity play after retention. They learned all this stuff in, you know, phase one. And then in phase two, this is the continuation of it. And it was like on a dime flipped in completely different way of how you do activation, how you celebrate milestones, um the the framing of it, like all those different things. and then layers in all the other pieces because you're still going to have the gamification. You're gonna still have those. So context is so important. Summaries um back up here. So when you have these books and these YouTubes and like or YouTube videos and newsletters, you want to consume them, but you can only like retain so much and it's kind of just good to just be immersed and just have the videos on and have them in your ears all the time and just like constantly having it. Um, but what you can also do is feed those entire things as summaries or as themselves to then summarize out to you inside of GPT all in this master thread or collection of threads. So, they're feeding off each other. So, you basically have everything it knows. It has everything you're feeding it about your context and then kind of going deeper down the rabbit hole are like isolating pieces of what it already knows because it can find these a lot of the time. Um, but you can take entire, you know, this is the best book about it. give me summaries from this and apply it to my event or my my situation. Go to extremes. These these three are kind of like fun, but I take it to the highest level of extreme in anything, whether it's the math of it, whether it's like it's just so much easier to understand the I do this with everything in life, but if you take it to the extreme, you can see the difference. So like what if it was like the lowest possible? What if it was the highest possible? And you can do that with different metrics on things. You can do that with whatever because everything's going to land closer to the middle or you know it's going to lean in one of the two directions. So being able to understand how far you can take something and whether that's your copywriting, whether that's your media buying, whether that's your team, um taking it to extreme and then also the ability to go down rabbit holes. So like the whole like double click on this and go deeper concept. You can really do that inside GPT where you find a piece of something about community management and you just want to go deeper deeper. Where have people done this? What is the most successful of this? Uh now give me breakdown of this company. How do they structure their entire offer stack? like you can kind of web your way through and it's literally just like consumption, consumption, consumption, but on your terms, right? You're not just scrolling through some feed and getting it every third thing and then using it to think better. So, constantly asking how could I approach this in a in a better way? How can I approach this in a way that's more scalable? How can I approach this in different ways? Uh is super helpful. Now, building the stack, how I do this then is as I'm going through here, I'm collecting things. So if I'm on uh YouTube videos or paid courses, coaching, I am keeping a notion that is basically like I have all my learnings and then I have each I have a page or even subpages from there of each thing. So like everything from like how to run YouTube ads to copywriting um to uh you know automations to operations and team development like I have different ones. You click into those and then I'm just keeping and compiling notes structured from the course. like subheaded video 2.1 is about this and I keep my own version of notes and I link things out and I feed all of those in to basically like what did I take from it you're just taking notes simply put but you're putting in there and then over time you can like codify different frameworks that you use so it's like I break this down I then summarize this section and these are my action plan from these and then what you can do is take that entire feedback feed it back into GPT into that thread and be like here's what I picked up from across these so this kind of goes back to like the summaries portion Um, and then you can basically create as your assistant. So, as you begin to actually do this, which I'll cover right here, but as you begin to actually implement, which is like the number one thing, um, you can use it as your assistant to give updates on like here's the data that's coming through so far. Here's where I'm at with this. Oh, here's a roadblock I hit. And it can navigate you because it has enough context to do that. Okay. Okay. So, I have like complete dedicated threads where I have everything from equity and and legal conversations to uh low ticket math and launches and like where we're at with CPAs. Just everything you can imagine and the depth of it. I I mean, I just built one entire thing on coach comp like the different compensation models for the fulfillment and how you can tier it and what other top people do for bonus structures versus percents. Like, you just have to give it the right thing and ask the right questions, which again is why this framework exists the way it does. Identify the right thing and make sure that you're constantly doing a sanity check. Am I optimizing and trying to learn the right thing being immersion you just constantly have it around you and in your head and you're getting nuggets and ideas paying to jump the line and get the structured version of that immersion and then feeding it in and giving the context for yourself getting your unique context categorizing those learnings and then feedback loops implementing is the number one thing. So again, circling back to sanity check, are you learning this just to learn it and it's fun for you? Cuz like that's a completely different model if you're just trying to like learn art or um learn, you know, travel or do these different things that are kind of like passion projects versus if you're doing something that's tactical that you need to implement now because you could learn everything about paid ads, but if you never run a paid ad, you haven't learned anything. Overgeneralization, but like you you can't even count it because why are you learning it unless there's some other higher leverage play. Um, but you need to launch. You need to gather real data. And then I put this on here, but hard uh hard and also easy mode is doing this all public. So being able to share what you're learning and share like that you're in the trenches and doing it both makes it harder because it's like you have social pressure, you look stupid, you whatever your mental beliefs are, which none of those are true, but uh and then it's easier actually because there are a lot of people out there that are going to help. There are a lot of people that are going to be able to identify where you're at in the journey of 0 to 10 on skill. Um, and yeah, I just wanted to add that there. But feedback loops are so important. So again, you've identified, you're constantly taking a sanity check on if you're listening to the right people and what you're doing. You're immersing yourself and surrounding yourself with the environment of things to just like absorb it, you know, put the book under your pillow type vibe. And then you are speedrunning where you can pay for the right people. Once you've identified who are the actual best in the space, you are then using GPT to take those learnings, go back and forth, and make it contextual for you. You're constantly building a dock uh or stack of things that are your learnings from it and how you can apply it and then you are implementing and this is an iterative cycle. So I wish I would have put this in like a ch in a in a circular chart but it is an iterative cycle and then the question is where do you break out? You have two roads ahead. Okay. Is this a side quest? I do hundreds of these. I will learn the most random [ __ ] ever and just like do it. But I have I realize that they are side quests and they're like feeding this like desire and interest of me and I have now allowed myself to basically look at them as that versus looking at them as distractions or like starting up another business. I use this example but like in I think it was November, December, I was like, "Oh, I want to like run ads from zero and I want to, you know, drop ship and do something just cuz I'm interested in it." spun up a page, did this, you know, bought whatever course, did a free course, watched a ton of YouTube videos, landing page optimizations, AOV boosts, like these different things, launched it, did 100 grand in a month, like back and forth, and just was like, "All right, I learned it, broke even on it, by the way, 100 grand in, 100 grand out." Um, but like learned what I wanted to learn, and then was able to take portions of that and apply it into our current main business and some of the info stuff, right? So, I learned stuff in e-commerce and how to do it and then there were pieces of it that I could then apply inside the info and coaching. And that's where I go with this with this polymath and where else can where else can this apply? Polymath was just like way overused when you know basically Elon it was this huge thing is like he knows all the stuff about physics. He knows all the stuff about you know energy. He knows all the stuff about whatever. uh and he can use those skills like interchangeably and that's how he can create a Tesla or SpaceX because he knows things about all these different spaces at like a pretty deep level that when you combine them you're like one of one versus like you're never going to be the best in the world at I'm not never somebody is but uh you're never going to be the best best at math call it um or like you know economics but the example of combining those two or combining that with geography or combining that with info business or combining that with these different skills you can become the best person because there's overlaps on how you learn something over here and how you can apply it in this business. So that's what I mean by where else can this apply. There are things that I have learned in random stuff that I have ventured off and side quest on that we have then brought back and applied. So there's stuff that's in the software space on how they do things around retention and how they do things around activation that we have used inside communities. There are ways that there's just a million things. So my goal is always just to become dangerous in it. So, I want to be able to go in and tinker and break things, know what's happening in a meeting context that's like deep in a department, but like understand what's happening because that's where this then goes. You've learned all this, you're iterating on it, and then you have to decide, are you going to be the best at this, and you are going to take, you know, what I just said here is 50 to 100 hours over a week or two versus are you going to become the best, and that's thousands of hours, and you're going to lean in and lean in and lean in and continue to go there, or are you going to know enough about it, be dangerous, and then you're either going to delegate it, and you're going to have someone on your team who's actually it, which is my preferred method. So, like I'm learning this stuff right here so I can be dangerous. I'm not learning it so I can lead the MR community and do the activation, the gamification myself and lead the department. I'm doing it so I can understand and then find the best pieces that are contextual for us to then push into the company and push into the team that's leading it and be able to delegate it out to make sure that it's done correctly, but understand it. Can't delegate it very well without understanding what's happening and knowing what to track. Um, so yeah. So the other option is always automate it. There are certain things that are automatable uh that you can do this with. So being able to automate anything that's a technical thing or um you know there's full flows and things now with you know how you do AI and how you use NAN or Z or uh Zapier that you can automate out these things that you've learned. So that's a fun one. And then yeah my goal here is ownership versus expertise. So in a lot of this I want expertise level of like you know top 5% top 10% you know I'm sure that's probably more accurate of my understanding of things and then have ownership over where that exists within the company and within there because you can this is just like a really high high lever thing. The idea of you learning Facebook ads means that you can either work on a team of somebody that and run and be a junior media buyer. You can have your own agency or I mean you can be a solo guy and have six clients that runs Facebook ads. You can own an agency that does Facebook ads. You can like I mean like you can go it's how deep do you want to go or how high up do you want with leverage and that's skill stacking because then you need leadership because then you need sales to sell it. You need all these different things but it starts with just being able to run Facebook ads. And when you stack it you can have an agency that does 100 million a year that just runs Facebook ads. But it requires more skills that you stack on top of that as you climb. So, and then always being able to revisit. So, things are constantly learn changing. I used AI and AI as an example here, but they're constantly changing. So, being able to come back to them how things change at Facebook ads, different optimizations, how they roll out different campaign structures. Now, it's smarter with the pixel when before you would try and like push this in. Again, using that as an example, but constantly being able to do that. So, quick summary, identify. You want to make sure you know what you're actually optimizing for and why you're learning it and identify the best people in the space to learn from. Constantly do this sanity check as you step through here as you're coming back and forth as does this really make sense for me to be doing. Is this what I actually am supposed to be learning and developing on right now? Immerse yourself in all the [ __ ] Go into every little bucket of this. There are the depths of the internet that you don't know exist about woodworking for cars, woodworking for like you have no idea the depths. So being able to immerse yourself in that speed running by paying for different access, finding mentors, finding people who were uh who were where you are and getting to and got to where you want to be. Um, and making sure you identify the right gurus, using GPT this entire time to have context and go back and forth with you, cataloging all of your learnings, implementing for actual feedback and looping constantly through this process and then deciding if this is something that you are learning for fun or if you are learning to delegate or you are looking to do yourself, right? real life examples of this. I bought two or three different courses that basically taught the VSSL, taught the tech, and then taught the sales of how to do a callunnel. Launched the entire thing in a weekend, and by the next week, we were doing, you know, 20K in a week, which was, you know, basically on pays for that 100K month, increased pricing, got another sales thing to learn how to do sales management, like order forms, routing, all the stuff we had no idea existed, all while iterating on the VSSL from another course, all while running ads that we learned from another course. And we iterated that and you know 5 months later we're doing a million a month all from things we learned in courses and then me just obsessing over different things inside this space and constantly asking questions to the right people who had already done this. Um so that's how we did that one and then the MR community. I was posting about this live but I'm just trying to find the best of the best who actively run this study what they do. Um, I already collected a bunch of the books, did summaries before they physically arrived and fed them into GPT to give them context to my situation and I haven't bought anything yet. So, that's kind of this next step other than books. But, um, I haven't bought anything yet. So, if I can find somebody who can do this and then my real goal here is just to learn it um, completely so that I can delegate it out. It's already going to happen without me. But if I can add some extra juice or have some context so I can understand kind of the levers that we can pull to make this the best possible, that's the goal. So that's that early morning one today. So sorry if the energy is low, but it's not. Just sounds low. Um daily update. Yesterday we did like 50 or 60 G's. Um day before that we did the highest day we've had since September. Um which is like 120 130 something like that. So things are on the right pace. We got a sales manager in now. uh through posting which is great because the content is working uh and I'm really excited for him. I think just that alone will get us back into um basically all-time high record or you know top pacing months and then from there it's just growth of the team restructuring of that. So anywhere from four to eight weeks would be the target on that and we just keep on pumping. So today's video 52 54 something in a row. Um so all of them are cataloged here so you can see and I break them all down by different category that we have. I've been making them every single day. So, hit me on X or IG if you have any questions. Happy to help with anything.

# financing, pay plans, PIFs... (info/coaching cashflow) | E55
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=354_ScXNyfo

In today's video, I'm going to be talking about financing, payment plans, and cash collection. It is all the craze right now to use financing. So, I'm going to walk you through some simple math models to show you how much money you actually keep when customer use different payment methods and when the cash is actually collected, which is a big big difference across these. All right, so we're going to go through those examples. We're going to go through the different financing options and some of the things the customer sees. And then some of these notes are super super important on how you do things like term alignment and different tools you can use. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've now done 72 million in that business in total. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on this channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. All right, so let's dive in. Now, I'm going to mainly just live in the spreadsheet, but I just want to use this as a guide to walk you guys through. So the different main types in almost all of these and and I can basically touch on info uh versus coaching but for almost all these we're going to use coaching as the example. So first thing is the three different core main types. There are so many different variations of this. This is my napkin math. This is my not opinion but kind of opinion on this and these are the three coursees. So you either have someone who plays a piff and I put discount there because a lot of the times it's framed as a discount whether it actually is or not. So in this example, we're going to say a PIFF is $8,000. Okay? So in your PIF model, you're going to have that you collect $8,000. Now, this is both cash collected and revenue. We're going to use those interchangeably because that is important in this because there's both of them exist. Okay? So when you have cash collected versus revenue is the total contract value of what you sold, which will get be important here. Internal pay plan that is going to be generally speaking where you have terms internally to collect the money. So you're not using any partners, you're not using anything. And in that case, let's use an example because you're generally going to I mean almost always you're going to charge more for this because you have risk of cash collection and you also want to frontload as much cash as you can. So in this example, we're going to say it comes out to $10,000. So instead of selling it for $8,000, instead you're selling it for four payments of $2500, but you are collecting the cash. So you get 2500 right now and then you have it set in your system for three months later you're going to bill another 2500 another. Other people do this where they can frontload it. So it'll be like oh it's $2,500 a month for the first four months and then you get a year access. All of this is a coaching annual example for this but you can make this work for you very very simply just using you know the formulas I'm about to go through. And then external financing. External financing. This one is the big question. So a lot of people will use the exact same price for PIFF. A lot of people will use a little bit higher, right? It kind of all depends on you. And external financing is going to be something like a firm, uh, Split It. WAP has a ton of options. Uh, Clara, those different examples. Uh, a little bit harder in the education info space. That's why is crushing it with this because they have, uh, you can do it direct through them. And then there's a bunch of other like coach specific ones like my coach or whatever it's called. Um, so with these ones, generally speaking, generally, uh, you are going to collect, you're going to charge more because you have a fee. Okay? So, in this example, let's say your PIFF is $8,000. Your fee on this, and I'm going to go through the exact fees, but we're just going through a quick overview. Your fees on this are going to be anywhere from 10 to 15%. I'm going to break those down and how they happen, but so for a 10% example, what you're actually going to cash collect is 7,200. Okay. Now, that is because 8,000 and we're just using a 10% fee of the amount that you're collecting drops down 10%. So, you're actually collecting 7200. Okay. Now, we're going to walk through these different examples now, but I kind of want to talk about this first. So, for the external financing portion, why I say that the fee difference and the spread is there is because if you use something like a firm, for example, they are providing you with a you're getting a credit card number. Okay? So basically how someone's entering in is they're applying for a loan through this and they are then getting approved getting a virtual credit card that they can charge with your system. Okay. When you do that you are then charging them on your processor. So you are making a 2.5 or three or whatever percent CC charge that you pay to Stripe to whatever your processor is, whatever your fees are. So you're losing 2.5 there and then you're also paying a percentage to the financing company. Okay? Okay. So, when you pay the financing company, that's going to vary anywhere from 7 or 8% to 12 to 15%. Rough numbers, we're going to say 7.5, 2.5 to a credit card processor. Both those numbers hit, you lose 10%. Okay. Now, other options of this places like split it. Split it is going to be through W because they have such high volume transa uh volume limits on theirs. It crushes like I know companies who are doing large numbers using this like very large numbers using this. Theirs is different. It is a higher fee structure. It's anywhere from 10 to 15%, but it's a so. So, you are making the money through a on the back. So, you don't have to add the credit card processing. So, basically processes, hits, lands, you know, the classic 3 to five business days. So, that's where that that will hit there. Okay. There are other ones that I'll go through at the end of this just kind of as like notes on here and then these are really important. Um, but let's get into the math. So, I'm going to let this take over. Hopefully, you can see this. See if I can zoom a little. So in option one, we're going to go through the cash collection and when you actually receive it. So like the cash flow of when this occurs. So in model one, and again where I'm getting this, and if you've seen the other videos, uh this is basically the lead acquisition funnel and what it costs to achieve each piece. So if you get a $30 lead, this is using a VSSL opt-in funnel. Just very simple. Cost you 150 bucks to get an app. Cost you $300 to get a booking. 50, you know, 5% of them show on the booking. So, it cost you $545 for a live show and then 20% of the live shows close, which is a $2,700 CPA. You can mess with any of these. You know, I know people who have 40 plus on this, but then your CPA is 1,500. I know people who get $10 leads, and that funnels flow like crazy. All right, so very variable, but we're going to use this as an example. So, in an internal PIF, just like a normal PIFF, someone's going to pay you $8,000. All right? And this is going to be kind of funny, but so they're going to pay you $8,000. Your ad costs on that from here are going to be 2,700ish. Your sales team is going to be anywhere from 13 to 15% of this. And then your fulfillment, if you're doing coaching, there's a lot of variables of this. And I have the different ones where it's if you're the coach versus if you hire coaches versus if you're doing group coaching. This is the example of onetoone coaching where you're paying a coach. Okay, that's going to be the service delivery portion of that is going to be 15 to 20% let's say and people get away with doing better but this is for onetoone service versus group. Group you can get it down to two or five or whatever percent and when it's you it is zero in cash but much more in time. Okay, so in this you're going to be making 36% basically gross profit. So you're going to make $2,800. All right. Now important fact of this month one, month two, month three, right? So on month one, you are you are collecting all of your revenue. You have $8,000 in cash collected and $8,000 build. Okay? So all of that 100% cash collection. Your ad bill is due basically this month. You could technically throw it out to month two, but for this example, we're using it here. You're going to pay your $2,700 ad bill. Your sales team is going to get paid immediately as well. And your fulfillment team is going to, generally speaking, only get paid to start. So, your gross profit that you see in cash on month one is like $3,900, right? But your total that you know it is, if you're tracking your numbers is 2,800, $2,900. So, there is a,000 spread right there or $1,100 spread right there that you will slowly drip across the year that you are paying a coach. Okay? There are people who do this where they just model it and they go, "Hey, hey coach, here's the $1,200 I'm going to pay you for this client for the year." A lot of people do not do that because if you have this person leave, if you want to change stuff or whatever, you just prepaid them and then you'd have to go out of pocket again to pay a second coach. So, it's very realistic in terms of how this actually works. So, this doesn't seem like a big deal. You know when it's a big deal is when you're doing a thousand new clients a month and you are seeing this number and your CPA is fluctuating like crazy and it's going to 3,000 something and all of a sudden your sales team is hitting all these bonus thresholds and they're at 17 or 18 and this number starts to get a little tighter and tighter. Your overhead's climbing and all this is happening and you're not putting in a bucket 30 of these a day, right? So if you're just selling a,000 units, that was my quick math but it's 900. it. So, if you're not putting cash aside to know for the next 11 months after first pay, you still owe another $1,000 in this example, you h you have to pay that into the future. And if you're not bucketing that out, so this one is an example of what happens where you collect all the cash, you look crazy like profitable, but really just have a ton of cash flow that's coming in. And if these numbers are higher, which they can be, like you need to make sure that you have this cash for all of these pieces because the client paid for a year of service. You need to fulfill on said service with a coach that you have to pay for over a year. Okay? Or for the year, right? So that's an example. Now, next one in uh internal payment plan. So in this example, we said instead of an $8,000 PIFF, you're going to self- finance them. You're going to do it internal. So, you're going to charge 10 grand in total. So, you're going to have 10 grand in revenue, but really on cash collection, you're going to have $2,500, which is going to drive that down. Okay. Now, in this model, you're paying $2,700 in ad costs. So, here, let's actually do this. So, first things first, let's make sure I have these aligned so the numbers are equal. So, 15 here, 20 here. Okay. So, same cost structure, right? Oh, yeah, but that that's carrying that. So, no, it's not. Let's do this just so they're the same. Right? So, you're paying $2,700 a year. You're paying a sales rep, which is technically, this is kind of true, but we'll mess with that in a second. And then you're paying $1,600 in fulfillment. Right? So, on paper, you're like, "Oh, I'm making way more money." Way more money. Right? But what's actually happening is you're collecting $2,500 in four payment plans to get to your 10,000. You just paid a $2,700 ad bill. You have a sales team that you're paying. And what really happens depending on how you have this structure, this is actually this is a nugget. You can pay your sales reps however you choose to pay your sales reps, however your comp plan wants to. Now, it is very common to pay a percentage but maybe smaller of a total revenue collect uh of a total revenue amount just like right off the rip, which is crazy to me. There is a method where you pay them every time a payment comes through as that commission amount or there is you pay them this amount or maybe a little bit higher of what you normally pay as a percentage on the only the cash collected in the first 30 days. That is what a sales rep is responsible for if they are selling payment plans of thousand you know 10 pays and just like racking them up over and over and over. There are future numbers like cash collection percentage and things that you don't know about yet. And what I'm about to show you is you are in the hole for months depending. So in this example, you're paying your sales rep on the entire full amount and your fulfillment is that same 1,600 and that still drips out. Okay? So nothing changes there with how you're fulfilling in the coach. But what happens is you only collected 2500 in cash and what actually happened is you subbed fees from your credit card thing and whatever else little small fees that you have to process that payment. So you actually kind of cash collected like 24,400 call or it's probably harder than that. But month one you're down $1,900. Doesn't seem like a huge deal. Understood. But what's actually happening is or I'm sorry, what happens if you're selling a thousand of these a month. This is like the whole cash trough game. If you're only selling pay plans or majority are pay plans, you are like deeply this is per unit. This you're deeply in the red for month one. Month two you still have no new cash and you're paying a coach. So it actually goes deeper. Month three you paid to coach again. You're deeper. And then in month four, so basically you pay for the first three months and then on the beginning of that month is when you pay for the next quarter, you get another 2500 and you are now in the green by $239 because you just collected 2500 but you still paid the coach. You made $2,300 new net in cash that month and the blended across this so far is your $239 up. Okay. Now, as this drips across next month, next month, you're back into the red until you're over here. Okay. get another cash. Now you're back up to your 2,300ish slow drip down again. And that last payment, bump, that's what brings you into the bigger profit number. And all of a sudden, you're here. So on your normal, you collected 24,400 in total. You never even got to 2400 until the final pay. All right? And that's like the big difference here. So the things you don't necessarily know when you're starting or when you're scaling into this is what is your cash collection percentage? And that's kind of what I was talking about over here. So, what is that cash collection percentage? If that cash collection percentage ends up being 75%. You are never receiving this final payment on average. Sometimes it's like this. So, you lost money. Okay? If it's just the last one, you barely squeeze by and actually made less profit by getting more units and having more headaches and more things because you were like, "Oh, I'm just going to get a ton of people in on pay plans." But how it nets out is you actually don't end up making that full 10 grand because of refunds, because of people who just like cancel cards, people ghost you, like just you never collect the future cash. That's why like people use all these financing options and piffs and stuff like that is to get the cash now, pay for the service throughout because they want the cash up front because it's more valuable than some beautiful future number that is like not collected yet. Okay, so that's that model. Can go back and forth on it. We do it. I mean, we have them for sure in-house. uh we have like a pretty strict pro uh process. The other thing actually that's not fair. I didn't give you a full picture. So in this in this example, this would also stop because if you are monitoring this correctly and actually know who's falling off, you stop paying your coach. So the bleed essentially does stop. You don't continue to dig into the red because the second somebody stops paying you for coaching when they agreed to terms of payment, you would stop paying a coach. So, just want to say there it's not like you're bleeding money beyond well, you basically stop service when you stop cash collection. So, make note of that. All right. External financing. So, in this example, this is where I was talking about if you have $8,000 payment uh or an $8,000 PIF that you are charging somebody. Usually, what you would do or what a lot of people do at least is they would actually make this like $9,000 in total. So, you're charging N grand on a PIFF that's external financing. So using like a split it or something like that because they're going to charge you 15 points or 10 to 15 points. So in this example of that you'd actually be cash collecting 8100. You're going to make that on the first pay. It's going to drip down. Nothing is actually crazy on here except the financing and when you actually like receive the cash and then now we're going to go to the customer side of things because that's where the big variance is here for you. If you price this accordingly, the or you like do the math on this, you're actually making more than your PIFF if you increase it above what the fee structure is. Okay? So, let's get into that. So, again, everything's basically the same on this. I can go through and match these for you, but you understand what I'm saying. You're making more cash collected and these numbers would stay the same across all of these depending. Um, I did want to make another note. This sales team thing, a lot of the time you are paying the sales rep on this number. So, like the cash does get a little better in these. And if you have strong cash collection, you're not paying fees. You're actually making more money. Like you have less costs. Like this works, but it's like the long game. And the and if you have bad service, if you have bad product, like if you have bad you have bad issues that happen with coaches, like their pro your customer is not someone who pays their payments. Like this doesn't work. But if you hone this in, you can you can technically make more. It's just like a longer game. Um and all the big dogs use financing a lot of times. So like don't say that needs you need to do pay plans but just as a thing. So quick going through this CC versus AC. So I went through that. So the different ones is going to be a lot of the time like if you use a firm you tech you technically I think can do the other one. Um fee stacking I went through that. So going through how you're going to have credit card processing fee and you're going to have that fee and then a firm split it. So how split it works and I just want to go through the different options of these is essentially split it must be put on a credit card. So when you use a credit card, you have to have the amount in credit limit available on the card. So let's say our program is $9,000. Like if you don't have $9,000 or in this example, yeah, I use 9,000 for the bottom option. If you don't have $9,000 available on your card, you can your customer can't check out. So what they're going to do is they're basically going to charge uh the first payment and they're going to charge the remaining. So that full 9,000. They're going to they're going to check the card for it. So, it's going to sit in that like pending bucket and then the first payment is going to end up posting and then the other one is just like a check to make sure that the credit limit's available and then it'll fall off in three, seven, 14, whatever the day range is. And then we'll throughout the process, throughout the 12-month term, six-month term, whatever they decide to sign for, they are going to check that the amounts are there. And then every 30 days or whatever the pay plan structure is, it's it's every month. So, it's like either every 30 days or every month on the day, it is going to pull that amount and you are they're going to slowly pay it down. So, it's a great option. A lot of people are crushing it with it. It just has a higher fee structure and then you're collecting it via a after multiple days. There's a whole other system and talk about this about like how you handle refunds or how you handle like payment dispute issues once it comes to like having these. The other thing is it is not a loan. Okay, so let's just actually jump down to this because I just want to talk about this real quick. So, a loan versus credit card versus these other options. So, you kind of have three options when it comes to external financing. Um, a customer basically gets a loan, a customer uses one of these options that are like complete like approvals and then you have credit cards and like someone else is so muching better at me than this. So like there's probably nine options but like these are the three I'm using as an example or you can get people approved for a credit card. Okay, so a lot of people do this very very popular in the MMO space because you can get them approved for like some 0% interest card for the first six months. They put 10 G's on it. You're gonna help them learn how to make money and make the 10 G's plus all this other stuff back and pay off the card before they ever have any interest. It's like a it's just like a pay plan, but you get all the cash up front as a company. Okay. So, big difference with Split It is it's all 100% approvals, no APR, and it's just the financing. The fees are just on the back. So, the fees are for you. So, I'm bouncing all over, but So, fixed fee versus variable. Um, a lot of these programs are going to be fixed. I actually have brokered some deals where it is a variable on the back as long as it's fixed on the front. So, somebody like a firm is actually going to have 0% interest free, all these different things that they're going to push towards, but sometimes they will offer offer APR. Sometimes they'll do partial approvals, some of these things. And a lot of people can't even get approved in like the info education, whatever space for a firm at this point because a ton of people did it. Um, but with that it can be a variable in the front end and it it makes it so you can't sell your customer the example of oh it's you know I think at $8400 it's $700 a month. So like it oh it's uh it's $700 a month when the sales rep's talking to them. They go to fill out the affirm thing. They got to fill out the small app or whatever and get approved for it and they go to do it and said it's $812 a month and it's like okay well you told me it was 700. So like that's not cool on the variable side of things, but something like split it and something like an internal pay plan, like those are exact fix. So it's very easy to sell it. You always know what the answer is going to be. You just have a bigger fee structure on the back. Um is one big thing. Term alignment. This is huge. Term alignment if you have pay plans. So let's say that you have a six-month coaching program, okay? And you offer people to pay for it for 12 months. Now it is a lower monthly fee. you're going to get a higher take rate. It's going to take up a majority of your cash collection depending on how your sales reps are and how like a majority of your units. And depending on what you're trying to accomplish, it's not going to convert in the best way towards ascension, towards retention in these different ways because at month six and whatever, you're going to try to push them to either stay and pay again or you're going to try to push them to go into some other community or renew or whatever. and they have six more months of payments they need to make on that credit on that for the first six months because you misalign the terms. I have made this mistake. I did it on accident when we initially signed up for this and set all this up. I just didn't even know that the options were available and they were misaligned and it nuked retention rate because people did not want to then pay you 300 500 whatever a month when they're still paying three or 500 to their affirm their whatever because they signed up for payments that were longer than the term of your service. Okay, a lot of people will do this at size because it doesn't matter and they make all their a lot of their gross profit or like of this of their majority of their customer LTV uh in that first payment and they go okay if we can get them at this higher amount we can do this bigger cash collection then it doesn't matter we can just make the money here that's not how we play and it was a mistake for us to accidentally like like basically allow it without checking it when it happened. Um, customer brand quality. That's a big one. We've had this a lot of mixed bags on this. Some people are like, "No, the people who finance everything are like the worst customers." And we kind of agree with that. Like we definitely, if you look at our complaints or this and that, almost all of them are people who did financing external, not internal. Um, so really guess depends on the market and who the person is and what the offer is. Like it depends on a lot of things. So just like look at your own data for that. Um customer brand quality also in terms of that is like there are a lot of companies out there that are like no like if you can't pay for this right now as is like you're not my customer. Great example tax wealth consultant guy that we met when we were at the event was like yeah I refuse to accept financing because if someone can't pay for it like they're not my ideal client because he helps manage their money. He helps you know do all these things with their taxes. It's like if they're trying to finance it, and there is a case to be made for somebody who wants to pay a small interest or no interest and make payments, you know, and then use that cash for now. But like in this example, he's like, "No, absolutely not." Like someone who's paying my $10,000 fee across 12 payments instead of just upfront is like not my ICP. So like that's very important. Um customer UI, same thing there. It's just important to understand how this looks for a customer and how they go through it because there are different options. Different ones will bring them through like credit approvals. Different ones will like reroute them and ask all this personal information. Uh other ones have none of those questions at all. It's literally their name, their email, and their banking, and it's like you're done. Or just your credit card name, your banking. Um like split it, for example. So, but higher fee structure, but really worth it if you make it work. So, WAP guys have that right now. They just signed that in like a month ago, and it's like apparently crushing for them. I've heard they've done already like uh eight figures through it. So, that's amazing. And then tools to use. WAP was the one example I used. Um, a firm has been great to us when we did use them like more heavily. We have very low financing percentage. That's why that's hot on the mind right now. Uh, because we're rechanging the terms of our deal on the back end, not on the front end. Uh, and talking about changing up some of the offers. So, if we do that, we just want to make sure we have the right fees. So, hopefully we can reroll this out and get 20 40 whatever percent. I still don't know what the hot spot is on what like the dream state of cash of of cash that is financed. um or have like how many pay plans versus not and tools to use. Another fantastic one, Golden Nugget lead, L E A D FI Douglas, he's a G. Um he created a software that basically with name, email, and phone number. You API to them and then it sends back how much if that person is qualified for however much in financing on like the pre-approval style things. uh both on credit cards and I'm pretty sure now on like the the pay now or whatever pay later I don't even know what they're called. Pay now pay later something like that. Um so with those you can then see how how much credit availability they have on current cards. You can see how much they're preapproved for. You can see um like some income ranges on like where they were posted. So it's a ton of data. So, a lot of people use it in the lead processing, but it's very useful if you want it at just the um so like people use it for routing when someone becomes an application for like who the setter should hit or to like DQ people automatically so they don't get your emails if they're under XYZ bucket. Um but another big one is to arm these sales reps with having the access to knowing how much they're available for. And I've heard that go both ways. It's like one if they see some number they don't like, they don't try as hard, but like they still could buy. it's just like you don't necessarily know it or the data is like slightly incorrect. And then I've also heard of people being like, "Oh no, like I I know with conviction that this person has access to 15 or 30 or whatever grand and this is going to change their life and they need to make a move on it." So both ways. But hopefully that was helpful uh the math on these and the sides of these. But yeah, hopefully it was. So uh yeah, message on Instagram, message on X, we're cooking along. Daily update. I add all these to www.rroncl.comdoc so you can see them. Um, we are cruising. We got a sales manager. Today is onboard Pulooa. So, I'm doing this early as can be so that I can do nine hours of meetings after this. So you guys rock and we will talk

# what's actually working in our "vv system" right now... | E54
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMs2lVrdNR0

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the VVS effect and what is working. Now, we currently are running three funnels. A VSSL opt-in funnel, a DTA funnel, and a low ticket ascension funnel. I'm going to be talking about which one of these is printing cash but not scalable. Which one of these is burning cash, but how altogether they are working now that we have over a month of data. Last year, we did 30 million cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done now over 72 million in total cash collected. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on this channel is to share what did work, what did not work for us, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of cool people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. First off, I am tired. My eyes are bloodshot. I'm on hour 14 staring at this screen. I did go to the gym, so that doesn't count. And we are running on nicotine, caffeine, and I'm a content creator now. So, let's go. All right, first funnel, we have the VSSL opt-in funnel, which is quick overview for everyone. A name, email, opted in to watch a free training. VSSL goes to an application after the CTA comes in the video. So, it is not you can't just apply immediately. You have to wait until the CTA, which is like call it 24 minutes. Some are shorter, some are longer. Land on an application. When they fill that out, they are routed if they're either quality or a DQ. Depending on how full the calendars are, the DQ will either send them to low ticket as a bridge or it will put them on a lower quality calendar, round robin, two different round robins, high quality, low quality. They will land there and then they will get on a sales call with a closer and they will be closed. Okay. The DTA is this, which is this right here. And that is just sending them direct to a page that is headline VSSL application that is right there. So they can literally apply the second they land on page that then runs through the same router. different application, different questions to qualify them more and then routes them to those same three options. If my video is lagging, I bought a new laptop and I literally haven't set it up yet because I have been on this one for too long and I don't have time. So, I'm sorry. And a load ticket. The load ticket is a two-step. So, first one is name and email. Then that is when they begin the checkout process, takes them to a checkout page. So, we get them as a lead as well as we can remarket to them via email. Then they check out on here, move over, and on the Otto is actually instead of getting more money and offering more things through upsells and downells, which we're going to talk about, it pushes them to a booking page where they book in with a setter, talk to the setter over here, and then they get qualified, disqualified, and pushed over to a closer call through set and then to a close. Okay? And then quick little thing, once they're done booking the call, we ask them to fill out an application. There is a direct correlate to the people who fill out more information inside the app on the end. Basically like an onboarding questionnaire that purchase. All right. So what are we doing here now? I have data on this for over a month. It's like 40ome days of these now where they've all been running in tandem, but we've been splitting like crazy. So I'm going to be looking at data over here because I don't want to put it on screen because it would take too long and I don't have that much time today. So I'm going to be looking at data over here and I'm going to be talking over here on these. So VSSL optin we are running two different opt-in splits. We have tried short or yes two different opt-in splits. We have tried short form. We have tried page copy changes. We've tried all this. The control still wins. So technically this is like a split that won a while ago. So it really is the like the control was a split from the one that we did like 70 million through. Um so one is actually winning of that. But now we are just running one of these and we are running one VSSL that won and the VSSL won by the split not winning. That makes sense, right? Our CMO came in and was like literally this you like if you run a split test and it is inconclusive like kill it. Go back to the control. We were not doing that for like eight months. We had two different VSSLs on and we had them all over the funnel in different places for retargeting and for other positions. So going through here, this is still directly our most profitable funnel. Okay, directly. Now VVS effect if you watch the roundt video it's kind of the joke it's the value vortex system which is what my CMO talks about and he talks about running all three of these in one. Now for our DTA you are we are getting dramatically lower cost per call dramat like aggressively lower but if you can understand why sending traffic direct they do not have to consume anything they don't have to opt in they don't have to do anything to apply right so you just have faster quicker throughput I know many people doing high millions uh a month with this model ours has not fully cracked or backed out okay so this is the one that if I was to say what would you turn offer is bleeding cash. It's that now interesting things I found. So I track and over here I'm looking at my data. I track when they come into the different funnels and then I track what happens basically on this backend which is the application, the booking with the closer or more so the call with the closer and then when they actually purchase. I have them sorted by who purchases. So on day I can see cool we had 12 units and then real quick across this way I can go where did they come in and at what times and did they come into multiple of them which is the value vortex system. Did they come into all these? Did they come into which one and in what order? Very interestingly, well, first off, for cold, this one number two was like vastly winning. So, it was winning on how many apps it was getting. It was winning on how many bookings it was getting, and it was also winning on how many backed out. So, I have videos on how we do tracking for this, but VWO has been the best for us because in a call funnel, it's extremely important. You're not having onpage events. So, you need to be able to see who backed out in the CRM and tie that back to what page did they come through in the split. Okay? So, you can do all that in VWO. very simply um vwo.com. It's like visual wooabooga organizer or something. I don't know, but it's vwo. I'm cracked out today. I'm sorry. So, also the comments on these last videos have been gassed. They're so funny to me. So, little things are funny to me at this point in life. Um now, this one, interestingly enough, if I look at the data, is showing over half of the purchasers that have come through this one have come through and already been in the original VSSL funnel. So, what does that mean? That means they're seeing an ad after the fact. They are already warmed up, which is the consumption theory, right? And then they're coming through here with a better application, a better system, better routing, and then getting on the phone with the closer and closing like real quick, like within two days, cuz it's a two-day booking window and like a very, very quick turnaround. So, what that means for us is, okay, maybe this is a function until we crack it on cold, which is like the real goal here. Because if you can practice on cold, meaning your VSSL, your headline, the consumption, the application does enough, you know, qualifying that even when you route people out that aren't qualified, the ones that come through are at a cheaper cost per booking than the ones that you'd get through a VSSL opt-in, like a normal one. Um, because you can get, you know, $50 calls through these, like no problem. Um, and up there you maybe get net net on the proper ones, 200 bucks, 150, 300, somewhere in that range. And that depends on a lot of things. A lot a lot. If you're optimizing for a schedule or a lead, you're going to get them for 50 bucks up there, too. But then they're not going to be the quality people, unless your pixel is like the most beautiful thing in the planet. And then if so, send me your pixel. So now for us, it is working on retargeting. So we have all these other campaigns that we actually don't do like real retargeting in the sense that you point them back to page, right? Like the middle of funnel ones. And we have the ones that we do. The ones that we do, we were sending to an old page with actually the old VSSL on it that used to convert better for us. At least we thought, and we didn't track properly necessarily. So maybe it was wrong. So we are now testing sending this as retargeting because so both in the emails which is a lot of them uh that come through booking wise and then also app then booking wise and then we're also testing it direct in ads. Okay so this maintaining to run the other thing on this is we're running a completely dedicated second one of these that is a different niche specific. So right we always talk about like the different buckets of it or the different messaging buckets. So, we launched another one that we had like in the archives basically that was um different optin or messaging around different opt-in, different VSSL, same app, same booking, same whatever. So, it was really just those first two pieces. We found that it was working on this. We said, "Let's launch it up here. Costs are solid. They're in alignment." So, they're not like crazy low, but they're backing out like crazy. So, okay. So, you have one of these up here that's rorowaz positive. You have one of these that's rorowaz positive. And then you have one of these of these variations that's very row as positive but mainly is acting as retargeting. Okay. Now the mystical one the low ticket. So we have three different variations of these. Number two won actually the original control still won and then we tested three and four and five and we finally have one that is beating the control. The control is ugly. It is gross and uh it's like almost like bad for brand in my eyes. It's so bad and I built it. So let's be very clear here. I was the one who designed it and built it. I threw it up in 2 seconds. I made a very beautiful one that was like an Allen Sultanic one had like a 3% page conversion. Good ones have like 8 to 10 bad. Then we launched a super ugly one just to like run retarget to and it was just like printing. Then we turned it to cold and it stayed at the same freaking rate at like scale or us, you know, mini scale but like testing scale. We made beautiful ones, nothing. Still haven't beat it. So now where we're at with this is we tested a new one that is a different format. Basically has everything above the fold. And that then sends over to the checkout page and the booking. The booking is crushing crushing like getting like 60 to 70% of the people that come through as purchasers. And then we also have a setting team then built into there that is pushing them back to get on a call or actually basically just connect with them live call, not push them to the set call and then push them to a closer. These stats on that, let me pull this accurate accurate for you just because I don't want to lie live. these stats on that. They're definitely Yeah. So, right now it's like 75% show rates of things that come through here once they get to a closer and have basically double the live call close. So, they are warm, they are process, and because they have the economics, which if you go into my other videos, you will see the economics behind this, it crushes. Now, why are we not scaling the out of this? Two things. One, it has a bandwidth issue here. So, as many setters as we get, we dedicate them to it. We try and do that best we can. You hit a weekend and something fluctuates. It's even a little bit lower. Random days, it'll pump out double the amount of units or 40% more of the units. Not double, 40% more units. It'll cook it completely, fill that availability. Now, on those days, you also have the lowest cost or net CPA because we're still sending spending around the same budget, but the economics are breaking. The economics is here, and then it's here, and it's here, and then it's here. So, the blended average is somewhere up here, which still works in a CPA basis. Like, I just said a lot of lingo. Let me back up. I just said a lot of things that are just very technical or or lingoy. The cost per acquisition after you collect the cash for this needs to be, call it 50 bucks, call it whatever. Let's call it 50 bucks. Just simple example for this. Okay. On days that it does a ton of them, same budget, it'll be around 50 bucks. Now, on other days, it'll be call it a 100 bucks. Simple math. In between there, the spread is 75. That is a massive swing when it nets out to what you're trying to get to, which is your ascension rate. Okay, our ascension rate is crushing. Last month is the biggest like question that we're waiting on because it takes X amount of time for those people to become from low ticket purchasers to back in ascension. We are doing everything we can to make it so that time table goes like this. For example, today we have like six of our units are ascensions. Okay. Now I track all this in HubSpot. So I have the purchase dates of all these things. So I can run a report and say everyone who purchased the low ticket last month. Show me a report on them and then how many of them bought the backend purchase since then at all during that same month into the future whatever. So I've ran this for the month prior. I've run this for the quarter before. I've ran all of that and we have been massively in KPI of what we're targeting for ascension rates. Cool. last month into this month, it is toggling a little bit of below KPI, but we're only five days into the month. And my guess based on the stats I'm looking at is over the next 10 days, it'll back out because those people then continue to consume. They see more ads, they get more emails, and then someone who purchased here is now warm enough and has already been nurtured enough to then book a call and apply. Excuse me. So that one is printing for us. But because the net CPA is rising and because or inconsistent, not necessarily rising, and because the call availability, it has like a double throttle issue. Now, I'm stupid. There's easy ways to do this. We can add upsells, we can add downells, we can make this into an AOV focus thing and basically make it front- end profitable. But because for us, the biggest thing here is getting them on the phone because we're trying to optimize for volume on the back end, that's an issue. So what are we doing about that? We are have been talking about it and for us we don't want to launch any of these like low like lowquality bad products. These quick faceless PDF things you see people launch and like just do it to collect cash. Like that's not our brand. That's not what we do. So we have to go through product creation mode in order to create the stuff that can be sold as order bumps and on there. Okay. So that's where we're at because as soon as we can add order bumps and even if we can offset it by $10 to $20, meaning that we're going to add order bumps to these checkout pages to make it so the AOV goes from 50 bucks to 60 or $70 and then that we can be over that range where we can scale into it knowing that those fluctuations still keep us within KPI. If we can do that, we can scale this like crazy. Put as many setters as we need just like on the bench sitting there ready because this is not hard to solve for. This is a little harder to solve for. So, we're doing everything on these page splits to try and just get it just naturally all while these products are being created because again, we're not going to sell [ __ ] People love to sell [ __ ] but we are going to sell good things because we want good products that then lead to better or not better but different uh products on the back end, the onetoone personalization, the onetoone coaching because that is where you're going to get you have the highest likelihood of getting a result. Okay? And that's why people pay me more for it. So, that's the current plan. um this one and we also have like complete different VSSLs being built around different brand faces. We are trying to reduce founder risk. We are trying to navigate and better align with the target demo uh with the brand face portion. So we're going to have multiple brand faces that do this across multiple right now when we ran when we run a brand face they run back to this core funnel which is uh the co-founder brand face. So, it like kind of has there there's some inongruency across that when it's like this person and then it goes to this person. Now, how is this going to work technically? I don't know because I'm probably going to have to have three different funnels built out for like different brand faces and we're going to go through. So, it's going to be brand face ad, brand face on landing page, brand face in VSSL. Big question, what about the emails? The emails come from the core brand face who it's been for 71 million. How do we do that? So, I'm navigating. we're going around. But I got a sales manager who's a rockstar, who's literally the number one person that we wanted and I'm stoked about it. So that's exciting because we solve for that. And then the feedback loops in these start spinning and we start going, "Oh, wait. 40% more of these clothes." Because now closers are hitting KPI and we know which one of these to feed. We can make tweaks to this. Another thing we're talking about for this one is adding a consumption buffer. So basically duping this out, VWO split testing it and just having the only difference that the button does not show until about 3 minutes in, maybe even as long as DT as as long as the CTA. So same thing I said up here, about like 20 something minutes. I don't know if we want to do that because we haven't taken them in. So it's kind of like a delicate balance of you don't want to like hold it off so long that they don't have anything to do on page, but you also don't want to wait. You also don't want like it works here because they've opted in, they've already showed the intent and you can remarket to them. If you lose them off this, the only thing you can do is retarget them back and that's kind of tougher because you might be losing people that would actually have the intent to do it and make it through the application at least. So, you just kind of have to play that game. But right now, it's like forcing zero consumption. They can just apply even though the questions are like, "Did you watch the video? Did you do this and this?" Like, and that's how we used to run it actually a version of it we used to run and then we stopped doing it and we ran this for a long time. It worked and we just scaled into that. So costs on this are crazy good, but it's more so about if it backs out, which is also a sales function. We got a sales manager. I'm stoked about that. That is going to be a huge needle mover for us. We're at likeund something on day and it's not that late right now. So things are looking good. Um, but things can be better and they can always be better. And we're trying to take this thing up to hundreds a day steady. So that's kind of the update. Kind of a mental blah. I am just busy right now. So, I'm going to get back to doing these early early in the morning so I can come up with like full ideas. This is more so just like brain dumps and me being dumb. Um, but I'm trying to make sure that I continue to pro provide value in these and continue to just give you an insight into what we're thinking, where we're at, and how we're trying to do it. And all by saying we don't necessarily know. There are dumb things that we've done. I found an automation that was broken. Oh, here's a fun one. Here's a fun little nugget. So, I saw someone talking about N8N. I felt like an idiot because I'm like kind of the tech and automation guy, but I haven't even touched the tool. So, like I'm not the tech and automation guy. Uh, we have three million something zaps. We pay like this absorbent fee. I think that's how you say that word. Uh, to Zapier. I sent these videos over to senior tech lead and said, "Hey, are there anything that's on our big ones?" Because we run like massive internal database stuff for the coaching side for like of analytics. So, we'll run like a complete database of things that show how many calls happened, sentiment of the calls with AI, uh what was covered in them, um did they cover certain things in them, the time of the calls, the averages across, like just this massive thing that basically shows like an analytics suite bird's eye view. Is the coach doing their job? And uh it's a lot of zaps. It's a lot of functions to get the data in and out, in and out, in and out, all the messages, all the stuff, all the video recordings, all of those consumed, all of them. Like, it's a lot. and it costs too much to pay Zap to do it. So sent over Naden and he plugged it in and we just like literally saved like 50% off our Zap bill like because we replaced all the core ones that were doing like massive amounts of data and N8 is functioning on executions not on tasks. So thought that was interesting quick little nugget simple things you don't even have to go crazy and go AI on it but now he's going to figure out ways to enhance it with the extra functionality. This was just a replacement which I made an X post about. I was like, I need to replace things first, then enhance them. Um, or enhance them in the process of replacing them. So, brain dump again. But all the videos are on here. You know where to find them. Daily update is that we're scaling into it. We got a sales manager, which was our main bottleneck that we were facing or that we thought we're facing right now. Bookings are consistent. We can scale into them, but we can't scale into them without it backing out. So now assuming we can do that we'll be able to scale the front and the back and the middle which is like sales and then the back end is yet to be launched and is about to be launched for the retention big long-term play which is where all of the profits the big profits are made where the enterprise value is built and that's that. So talk to you guys soon. You know where to find me Instagram X all the things. Have a great day and I'll do another one early

# funnels, lead nurture, & growth questions... (30min Q&A) | E53
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfNKrhcwC34

In today's video, I'm going through all the questions you guys have submitted to the request box. I've not even reviewed these, so we're going to realtime answer. How to grow your coaching business. This doozy long one, live webinars, tracking show rates, video nurture funnels, a player closers, email stacks, all the things. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done 72 millionish. Uh now, I will update this on the next video. And I'm not selling anything. Everything is just showing in this channel what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. First one we have here, we run a coaching and agency business, dual focus. Uh, we're making 350K a month and the agency is 80% of the business. Cool. And we built a software in house. Okay. We also have a software triple split of focus uh to support the agency and to continue working with coaching clients after the first three or six months of training. Cool. We do not sell the software as a service. Okay. So maybe not as focus. And we have no intention to do so as that is our business mo. Cool. So use it on deliverable. Got it. It's on the fulfillment side, not on the sales side. Uh we get all of our clients from referrals and YouTube. Also great. Helps grow profit for the unit. And we never run any paid ads even if even if we're an advertising company. Okay. Well, kind of like the whole PRA practice what you preach, but is what it is. Uh, we can afford a CAC of 2K to achieve a lifetime gross profit, LTGP, uh, to CAC ratio of 15. Okay, so you're making 30-ish is what I'm going to get by that. So, you're making 30 in LTGP. The coaching business is more profitable and scalable, and we've seen lots of clients going from the coaching to the agency. And the coaching business is different from anything else in the market since they're all agencies. You're selling two agencies, built it off $100 million offer book, great book. Agency's AOV is 45,500 a month. Solid agency churn is sub4% which is great. The coaching's 20k for three months. That's solid. And 2.5 after that ascension rate 75% from coaching LTV. So from the 20k to the monthly, which is also good. And for the LTV for both is 45K. So quick math on that. 2K for CAC ratio to L to LTGP. So they're making 30G. So it's costing them 50 15K of the 45K to fulfill on the service and they're keeping 30 of it. If that math is quick and correct on my end or their end. Um bottleneck right now, here we go. Question is that we don't have enough booked qualified booked calls. If you would buy this business today, how would you 10x it? Who do you think we need to hire to fix this bottleneck? and how can I find talents talents like you? Um, all right. So, I'm I'm frankly I'm confused, but the bottleneck right now is that we don't have enough book calls. So, I think you're a marketing you're an advertising company, so you should be able to get qualified calls, I would think. Um, but let's say you don't know how to do that. Uh, so if you buy the business today, I will take 25% of this business, drop in my DMs, and I will do twice a month co coaching calls and steer you clear. Just kidding. But, uh, how would you 10x this because of that? And who would you hire to fix this bottleneck? I would hire a growth marketer to just take over that portion of the business and give them a percentage of the new stuff that comes in and just leave it as that. So you'd front ad spend. I mean you could even do without the percentage honestly and just time to row. I mean you already know your numbers. So keeping the CAC under 2K so set it at 1K 1.5 and 2K and give them bonuses and or performance fees to do that. But if you just need to generate enough book qualified calls, which makes me think that you also might not have the booked calls that you just in it sounds like you might have booked calls but not qualified ones. Uh which is then just basically how you're running them through the funnel. So if the framing is correct to get the qualifying. So simple simple example, but like don't click on this if you don't have over 200k or if you don't make over 200 grand. Aggressive but like an example. So that's an extreme but you could do that same thing with like if you're a landscaper click on this. If you're an agency owner that does over 100K a month, click on this. If you are not, do not click this. Do not click this. Have it in the headline. Have it in the VSSL. Have it in the application. That literally DQS them and does not allow them to complete the form unless it does. And then you just need to run volume increase ad spend. Again, right now it looks like you only do organic. So, make sure it's in all your organic and you're not just pumping out stuff to get views and you're actually doing it for your target audience. Um, but yeah, that's how I'd focus on that. So, who would you hire? I would just do that. And how can you find talent like me? Uh I am I have no idea. I don't know what to say about that. You you just find like I was I built through this. I was not found like this. I was found building random sales pages and then learned this on the job doing it. So it was more so a risk in the other direction of where my skill set was here and it became here over time and iteration, practice, implementation. So yeah, that's what I would do. But I would just hire a growth marketer. And if you're an agency, you already know agencies. So, I would literally just hire someone to do qualified book calls and directly tie the compensation to your CAC if you know your numbers. So simple. Um, how do you grow a coaching business? Very vague. I do not have an answer for you. Uh, I would need to submit another one that has more information on where you're at, where you're stuck, what the current situation is, and I can answer it similar to this one. Um, yeah, I have tons of videos on this channel that are all about growing it, that are about scaling it, that are about the cost behind it, that are about the team behind it, everything. So, I'll do that. Live webinars. So, this is actually interesting because in the video where we all were just at the event, the one we're all wearing black t-shirts. I don't know why, but we just are. It's a digital marketing thing, I think. Um, they talked about how they do live webinars and then they use aevent.com to do basically like uh what webinar jam or some of those other ones used to do to like basically make a live webinar pre-recorded and then auto webinar. A lot of people back in the day and still to this day uh would sell products up to 2K. They used to call it like the auto 2K webinar. Um because that's basically like statistically supposedly how high you could sell something automated through a webinar versus having to use a call funnel. Anything above 2K back in the day at least. I don't know. I'm not super privy to the direct toart game on the mid to high ticket. So live webinars, we don't do them anymore. Um we do them internal, but when those guys were talking about it, they were saying they do it post-purchase of a low ticket. And when they do that, it is basically like they buy a low ticket and it's like, oh, and you also get this bonus of this free master class. They push them through the master class, which is really just a VSSL pushing them, you know, selling them on the next thing in the ascension. Um, and they do that both included in the low ticket and then push throughout the product in the community. Other people do it directly in the front. There are big boy companies that do it in make money online space that do live webinars that sell a 2K product. Once they sell the 2K product, after that they will book them in with a setter and then uh as like an onboarding call, go through the full presentation, quick start guide, the whole thing. And then they will push them over to a closer if they're a good fit, qualified, and looking for more uh you know, higher likelihood of result, which is personalization, onetoone coaching, like all that kind of side. And that's the higher ticket. So you go from 2K to 9K or 10K or whatever. Um, and then we have actually run them in-house, but the only time we've or I'm sorry, not in-house, um, we've run them well, I guess, yes, in-house, but also we have run them to our communities before when we do launches. So, when we've done supplement launches, we've done them, uh, where we did a partnership. I made a video on that. We lost our ass. It was [ __ ] terrible. Um, but that was on us cuz I didn't do the math right. Now, I know math better. But, we do stuff like that when we do launches. We do stuff like that when we do like swag drops, which are not made meant to make money for us, but we don't have never done that to like directly sell something inside the community. Um, but yeah, so that's kind of our take on it. Uh, a lot of people love them, a lot of people use them. We likely will use them. A lot of people do them for live events, a lot of people do them for challenges. Uh, we just have not used those because of the complexity around them behind them. And for us, the model and the math works on our current setup. There's just been breaks in the chain of the funnel. It's not the actual like offer structure model that's broken. It's like pieces of them. So whether it's marketing is broken, not getting enough qualified calls, solve for it. Now you get enough calls that are qualified like clearly there. It's a closing issue. It's a sales issue, right? So, like there's different parts of just one simple funnel that can break. It's not necessarily the whole model or acquisition method like you're saying here live webinars that needs to happen or change. So, that's my opinion. Um, can you make a video going over tracking show rates? Know it sounds simple, but I find it super easy to track row CPL cost per call. What is the best way you found to track actual showing calls? I'm currently using pipeline stages. Yep, me too. Um, that if someone puts notes to show, it fires an automation and does it. Can you go over system? Okay, so this one I feel you on this. I know what you mean by this. So it is extremely common for this number to be a little gray area. So it's all data in data out. Now a no-show or a cancel generally speaking is it is required that you have a more or less manual input that occurs from the sales rep because that is the only person who knows if they no showed or canceled like directly. Now, they can send it through email or text or something and there could be like a timer trigger and like all these things, but to be honest with you, the absolute best way is a sales rep is marking it. Same way that a sales rep is marking in your deal stages if someone is a no-show. So, it's good inputs. You need good inputs, good data to have good outputs, which is that number and that uh that number you're looking for on a tracker. So, I actually track this in two ways. I have a manual tracker and I have an automated tracker that comes from the CRM. So, the manual tracker is like the classic like look at Cole Gordon's videos like he crushes they they're closers so all they do is sales. Um, not all they do. They do a million things and they're great. But I just mean like they're very focused on sales reps. That's their entire business. Um, so they have manual trackers that are basically like calls booked on day, calls taken, no show cancel, offer closed, and then like cash collected and whatever and like all these other things once that and then you have percents across. So imagine this, you have 100 calls on day. Those calls all come through as whatever your default deal stage. So for us that is call scheduled. You have 100 that come in on call scheduled. Okay? Now anything can happen to them. They can then become a no-show. They can become a cancel. They can become like all these other things. A hot listing, a long-term nurture, a deposit, a closed one or a closed loss, like disqualified, okay? Or a closed loss or a disqualified because they're kind of different because like one is you could have won, one is they they were not qualified. All you're going to do in the automated version is you're just going to take the no-show and cancel and you're going to get 30 on there or whatever the number is. Most more realistically, you're going to get 55 or something on there. And uh you are going to have that number that's going to automatically either be in a viewer that looks at your CRM database and can pull that uh on day so you know that there was a 100 calls that were booked for day. Then you're going to have by end of day there's going to be reschedules. So you're going to actually only have you know whatever it is. You're going to have 40 that were live call. You're going to have 40 that were in no show and cancel buckets and then you're going to have like 20 that were rescheduled call it. So you're going to have 80 and 40 and you're going to have a 50% show rate. Okay. So once they land in those buckets, you're able to tell like where they went from there and you want to take basically and then on the manual one it's the exact same thing. It's how many calls were on day and then how many were no show cancel. So you sub those out 100 you sub those out. So there was 60 calls that were actually taken of the initial 100 that were booked and that is like the inverse of that essentially is your show. So I do it like you know minus basically and then divided across and I have it on both and they're like very very similar like there's small fluctuations. One will say 56, one will say 55.2. who and again both of them are reliant on a sales rep manually adjusting either the deal stage or the tracker for their daily tracker. Um some are easier for some teams, some are not. Uh we always just like to always have a uh sheet as well as the CRM because it's helpful in there, but it sounds like you're already doing it correct. Like it fires an automation. Only thing with firing an automation is a lot of times if you fire an automation into like a sheet, it just logs it one time and it's like oh this person no showed. but it's like the person could accidentally click it and then change it right after and it wouldn't adjust in your sheet. So that's why databases and like CRM are cool because they're real time. So like your chart would realtime change. It could go back and forth versus if you're logging them into a sheet, which it sounds kind of like you are. Um Oh yeah, because you literally said it. Um then yeah, it it likely you want like a live viewer. You don't want a logger that you are manually doing because every time something changes it doesn't update there. CRUD is what it's called. So, can you do a breakdown of a video nurture funnel? What is a video nurture funnel? The idea uh being you build the funnel within Facebook. So, you have top of funnel videos that capture 95% of the watchers first, calls out your niche offer. Middle of funnel videos, I assume still on Facebook, nurtures and builds trust. And then bottom of funnel is a VSSL to book a call funnel. I find that my product specifically needs a ton of trust. And I've had a hard time getting people to book a call and just pay a high price. Okay. So, you're talking about instead of having any pages, you're talking about having basically three buckets of people. Top of funnel, middle of funnel, bottom of funnel, bottom of funnel. I don't know if any of those words made sense, but you know what I mean. Uh, all on Facebook, which is very interesting because you never own the data. All you have is pixel data on that or or even like that. It's all you have is audiences that you can build from the pixel uh from the video view data and you're never sending them to your site by how it sounds like you're doing, which I don't do. We don't do. So, I understand the theory. I know people who run 10-minute VSSLs on Facebook on platform, like natively on platform, send them to a low ticket, convert like crazy. Josh was talking about that in the video where he has a friend that does, you know, 50K a day profitally on the front end doing that style of model. Um, we do not do that really. Like we have tested and done longer form videos. We definitely do it with testimonials or like kind of like compilation videos. um we have never at scale ran we've tried actually I know we've tried but like we've never run the full VSSL on platform uh for an extended amount of time so I don't know why you would want to do that and not own the data I mean I assume you're trying to go for a cost because you're trying to go for like video views and you're trying to just ramp it there so you can decrease the cost but like the economics work sending them off platform so I don't know why you wouldn't um I mean sure try it but all you would do is you would run a bunch of those on the top and then you'd have exclusion audiences. So like once someone does that, they only see the other videos and then like down the funnel. So that's like the same way that Jeremy Haynes puts in his videos, the hammer them strategy or like they were talking about that roundt video I uploaded about how you can do it for content on the front end prele, I'm sorry, pre- booked call, just do it with leads and they're just video view campaigns with no links. And the idea is once someone watches has a through play of one, you exclude them from that so they don't see the same video. So they're basically just seeing different videos of you over and over and over with like a 20, you know, 20x frequency across the campaign. That's like the general gist. So you're basically talking about doing that. And he talks about this actually. Go watch Jeremy Haynes's videos. He's so much better at this. And like he runs the actual ads. I don't run the ads. I just understand the concepts kind of. Um, but he talks about one, I'm totally blanking. It's like the fly trap, like the Venus fly trap method. And it's like this. It's like step one, then step two, then step three, and you walk them through the videos on platform. So he actually does do this. and then pushes them there. If your issue is a ton of trust, um trust is basically that their belief in you to get them the result. So that's case studies, that's testimonials, that's authority, like positioning, that's all of that. Um there are people that run ads direct and then also consumption once you get them. So getting their emails and then being able to remarket to them both through email and ads and continue to help them and continue to offer value to them builds trust. Uh so if you can do that through lead magnets and then just continue to market to them through those platforms with just more content, more value, do it through free courses, free stuff, things you normally, you know, sell, just giving to them. Like that's how you build trust, not just make them watch a bunch of stuff over and over on platform. Like that just kind of like gets them in front of you. I would, you know, I mean, I guess it's both, especially if we're providing value in the videos, but yeah, I would do that. Um, and then same with us, you know, we do an opt-in on a lot of our stuff and the ones we go direct to app on have a lower show rate and a lower close rate. Math, economics are like better, so like it makes it so it can it can get close to working. But we do the volume game for that specifically. So, we can do nurture, we can push them back to the site, we have tons of content on site, we offer them free courses, free stuff, and then when they're ready, they basically upgrade themselves. So, hope that answers. Go check about go check out har Jeremy Haynes I cannot speak Sunday night. Uh what makes an a player closer and how are you I able to identify that in the hiring process. It's the hungry one. I mean in the hiring process I mean that's a little tougher like you can kind of tell who's got it at some level and I haven't done direct hiring for this in like three years. So we used to hire we used to be the sales team and then we hired the sales team and then we managed the sales team and then we hired in managers for the sales team and then I have not been on the process of hiring or managing a sales rep since. So this is old news. Um these are yeah this is old. So but how I hear about it in operations teams and meetings and stuff is like you can just tell right you can tell and then once they're in everyone's running the same gambit. Everyone has the same like access to resources and tools. So the ones that stand out are the ones who identify themselves, who who stick out on their own and then putting resources behind them, identifying stuff and being identifying pieces that they can work on, making sure they have all the things that they need to do their job the best. And you can just tell they're just the hungry ones. They're the ones who aren't saying, "Oh, do I have a, you know, what's my minimum amount of calls I should have?" It's the ones who are pushing for the maximum. It's the ones who are opening the slots who see the opportunity and just absolutely grab it and just run. So I hope that answers. Um, again, not my super sweet spot, but for that, I would go to Cole Gordon. He's got a ton of videos on page that are all about that on YouTube. What does your email text stack look like in the back end for your opt-in application submissions between call reminders, nurturing, etc. What platform do you use to trigger emails based on different pipeline stages? Um, I've made an entire video on this. I think the thumbnail is where it's like lead to app to booking to close. And I basically talk about the different automations and what occur between them. Uh, for what platform do we use? is we use HubSpot for everything. So, HubSpot is our CRM on the sales, marketing, and a little bit of fulfillment side. Um, not super yet, but and like all of our data management. So, the email stack is that and then it's basically when they hit these different events and triggers, they get uh different properties at the contact level. So, in CRM, I have so many videos about these and you can look on the if you go to this uh www.rronclug.comdoc actually it's down here. this I have these broken down and in these I put like you'll be able to see which ones are which because this one is just these are the like you know clickbaity titles and this is what they actually are. Um so you'll be able to find one there like communication flow for the VSSL funnel like this one shows that. So basically you're you're putting a property in that says like when they achieved each event. So like an opt-in, an application, a booking uh um booked, what date did they book, what did they book for, and then when they purchased. And then you can identify like when they have this but not this. send them these emails. As soon as they have an application but not a booking, send them these emails. When they have a booking but not a purchase, send them these emails. And like you can pull them from list and add them to other automations easily um from that. So that's not really on pipeline stages. It's like a lead stage or like a lead where they're currently at in the funnel. Um hopefully that answers that. But what event do you optimize for? A lead or a schedule? Uh we don't do anything on lead. So Blake talked about this a little bit, but basically when you're launching one, you're optimizing for whatever you can get 50 conversions on in a week. So you can start to train the pixel. Uh, and that's from like scratch scratch. Uh, we optimize. So we have native events. So it's lead, submit application, schedule, and then purchase. Um, submit application and schedule only fire on the quality ones. So even though if they come through, the application routes them to different pages. And we only pushed back to Facebook the quality ones for submit application and schedule and then purchase. all of them are quality. Um, and then we don't know enough on a lead level, so all the leads come through. We optimize for schedule and we optimize for purchase and we do a mix of that. We keep a majority of ours purchase, but we have had major issues with our pixel and Facebook. That's why our acquisition exploded back when it did um because of this because we were unable to consistently generate bookings for the sales team. Um, and when we optimized for schedule, it was a way lower rate. It was a way lower quality, way lower close rate. Um and then when we optimize for purchase, they were getting capped and they were not fully spending and then you don't get enough purchases. It doesn't feed back signals. So then it continues to happen in like a vicious spiral down. Uh so yeah, so we had a lot of issues with this but in current state we run about call it 80% purchase 20% schedule. We want to run more on schedule. It is cheaper but it directly is like a correlate to cheaper is also lower show also lower quality. Um, so we're trying to play like a a we're trying to dance the line here on like how to keep enough volume while also just optimizing for quality people. So we're trying to retrain our schedule to make it so it's the highest tier quality people. So get the economics of a schedule but get the rorowaz of a purchase. So we're constantly playing this game and dancing with that. But hope that answers. And then same thing with low ticket. We optimize for a purchase. If you want a purchaser, optimize for a purchaser. and then just hope and pray you can get your volume and your cost in the correct thing and that the attribution comes back within the window because that's a big thing with call funnels. Um, and yeah, so also my video is skipping. I never backed up my Mac, so I still haven't moved to my new one, but sorry about it. Um, how to lead your team effectively and how do you keep your sales reps motivated after the first six months? How do you keep your entire team on the growth mindset and hungry? Now, I notice excitement can fade. Correct. Excitement can fade for you. Excitement can fade for your team. Excitement fades. completely. So the vision does not the cast out and the growth and progression does not. So that is a direct measurable that is easy to see that is easy to feel. Um so for the sales rep portion at least how do you keep them motivated after the first six months? It is known that there's like a lull that happens for sales reps and again this is not my zone of expertise. Please go watch like a Cole Gordon or some of these guys that like absolutely crush with this. Um Josh Joshua Troy talks about this. Um, it's a known thing that sales reps hit this pe like basically start to get, you know, they're human beings, right? They're not just like production machines and they have waves that they hit and when they hit a certain point or have been doing something for a long enough of time, it is very common for them to have troughs and how do you navigate that in the emotions. Go watch those guys videos. They're going to help you way more than I'm going to help you with that. But it is natural and it's going to happen everywhere. It's going to happen in your fulfillment. It is going to happen in your HR. It is going to happen in your finance team. maybe lesser because it's less uh banging your head against a wall that it might happen with a sales rep. Um but they're emotional. They're emotional beings and that's how they can navigate these conversations in a good way and also have these laws. So how do you keep the entire team on a growth mindset and hungry? Um I think aligning incentives is big. So I think them knowing that when the entire team helps each other and they dominate in their scope, so call it marketing or call it sales, right? they dominate in their role. They know they're going to get paid. And then also knowing that the rest of the team is in some relation way getting paid the same or getting paid in the same way when these other departments succeed is big. So you don't have to do that through a profit share pool, but there are ways to incentivize comp or tie the incentives to one another. Quick example of this marketing. So right now I'm talking basically how you keep the growth and hunger for the ops team. So like a marketing a lead of marketing can make x amount of dollars as base and then they can make a performance percentage that is based on call it net CPA. Now net CPA is all good and dandy. You can be the best marketer in the world but if you're running a sales team or a sales call funnel and the sales team isn't closing the net CPA will never be in alignment. So they have you know a horse in that race uh to make sure that the sales team is doing well. So it's tying the comps together right in that way. Same thing that sales has a rate has a horse in the race of marketing because if they don't have enough bookings they can't hit the volumes and they can't hit their incentive pace because they get paid as a percentage of net new rev. Um the fulfillment side of things is based on volume that comes from the sales team which comes from the marketing team and then also managing costs within there but if they need to pay their team XYZ to keep afloat they have to pay more per client because they don't have the new inflow. So they're also in the sales and marketing thing. So, it's basically making making sure everyone's comp and stuff is tied together so you always have that team um and everyone's driving towards the same thing. So, that's both the vision thing and then also just like a straight up financial thing um that you can drive behavior with. But every time they do studies, it's like, you know, the third or fourth most important thing is finances and the rest is like to feel valued, to feel like what they're doing is contributing, to make sure that what they're doing feels like progression. Like that's my goal of everything I do is just progression. Um just to feel the progression and feel like you're winning in that way. So hopefully that helps. But yes, excitement can fade, but habits do not. So how do you gain connections and contacts at the very beginning when you have nothing? Do I am the worst person to ask this question. Literally the worst person ever. Uh I have no connections and contacts or I had none until I started doing this. So I literally lived in a cave, didn't talk to anyone. I didn't I couldn't name I mean I could name because I knew who they were, but like they had no idea who I was uh in info and coaching space or really any space. Um I have never been one to really do that. uh in the last at least like 10 years I haven't or more. Um so how do you gain you are valuable? You put out stuff. You show that you're working on things. You do it raw. You are who you you are you to your core. You're not faking [ __ ] and people can tell that in two seconds. Uh so yeah I mean I think just being that I think buying courses and being communities I've bought you know simplest example. This is actually funny but like before I even started doing these I seriously had like zero. I had like the people I worked with and like original family, friends, girlfriends, stuff like that. And that was about it. And now I have hundreds of people that I can talk to that are in this like sector of online business. Uh the info coaching world and a little bit of lead genen affiliate and even those, you know, they're not there's not too much depth to them yet, but like I do have the contacts, I do have the connections and it's working. So, you know, me looking for talent opportunities and network is directly working from this. So me just sharing like where we're at in the trenches. And it has nothing to do I mean like it doesn't matter what the number is, doesn't matter if it's 100 million, doesn't matter if it's a million, doesn't matter if it's 10,000. Like there are literally groups on Twitter called build in public of everyone who's at zero dollars in cash collected and they have a band of people around them that are all supporting each other. It's like it's just a shared vision. Back to even like the last question and shared values on what you're doing um and just being a real person and doing that. So yeah, I think uh I think it's easy to do when you have nothing. I think it's actually maybe easier to do depending just by finding people who are in your space and then picking out the couple people that are maybe above that are willing above. I even [ __ ] hate saying that but above in terms of what your goal is or closer to the goal that you are trying to achieve. So, and then I've also met people in communities and groups. So, where I was going with that story and then I [ __ ] yapped uh is I bought a like memecoin trading whatever telegram thing and I just got in there and on and just started throwing Nate like talking about this and this and this and I had like 10 people I would talk to like all day every day when we were just like in the trenches for 18 hours a day just like making tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars like back and forth doing this and like it was just funny and fun. Is that real life and like real world connections? No. But like great example of like if you buy these courses and communities, you already now have a shared align vision. You're trying to start an AI agency. you're trying to become an online coach, consultant, you're trying to do marketing for landscapers, like any of those things, you already have that shared vision if you buy into something. Same way that if you're on a sports team, you have a shared vision, you have a shared interest already. Same way that if you are in XYZ place and town or whatever, you have shared something already. So, it's basically just choosing what type of things are important to you and then getting around people that have the same things that are important to them um that what they're going for. So, what do you last one? What do you look for when hiring an a when hiring a copywriter? Thought that was a grade a uh copywriter. And what would you say copyriters who what would you say to copyrighters? You think AI would replace them? All right, let's start there. I would think that copyriters already have been a large portion replaced. I was just at that event and there was a guy who owned a large copyrightiting company and basically said he's just like shutting it down and pivoting portions of it because they already got taken by AI. I didn't really know if I believe that or not and we'll see. Um, but it's basically who can use the AI. So, if copyriters can use it, there are guys who are crushing this right now, like Mario something, uh, Stephan Georgie, like those guys were on AI the second it was right there to use it in copyrightiting and just like essentially used it if you watch any my other videos to like decrease their fulfillment time and costs um, and just still charge the same thing. So, to my understanding, so you can fact check that, but the idea being that they just made them more efficient at their job, but they're still the best in the world. They still know what is the best in the world. they still know what works and AI got them 80% of the way there. So then they could do five times the amount of project load for the same amount of dollars assuming maybe a little bit less but you still did five times the amount of [ __ ] for the same cost or yeah now for the same cost to you. So um what do I look for in a copywriter results? I'm at the point now where I look for like experience. So if people are doing it or have done it, I want to see that they have. I like to know they've done it in the industry. I like to know they've done it in the space where they're already selling to that market. They know it's important. Um, there are people who go really, really deep in this and I think those have proven time and time again to be the best. You know, there's a ton in the Alen Sultanic Nothing Held Back group. Those guys are like so good. Um, I'm not a copywriter at all. When AI came out, it like saved my life because I could get 80% of the way there and post something live and a copyriter could come in and clean it. Before that, I had to come up with words or just funnel hack someone and copy paste and change [ __ ] and that was not ideal. Um, so yeah, I'm basically looking for a copywriter uh who has the experience, who has the results, who does it in a fair compensation way and who is smart to be efficient but not do it in a way that they charge XYZ mass amount, not based on results and then take 12 minutes to do it via AI. It's like that arbitrage is not there. The arbitrage is between the results and the time or money it cost the person to do it. Um, so hopefully that makes sense. I was going to take notes while I did that, but that ended up being 30 minutes. Apologies kind of. Um, so here is where you can submit more of these. I'll do these like every weekish. Um, I want to keep these kind of like high level if possible. Not high level. I want to go deep into them, but I don't really want like beginner e and these didn't feel like beginner ones. So, I feel good about that. Daily update. All these are in the dock. I just hit 51, I think, in a row. So, today should be 52, I believe. But that's what I got. Hit me on X. Hit me on IG and we will talk soon. Have a good week.

# you should NOT start an info/coaching biz... here's why. | E52
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpH5mLJ1JKU

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing why you should not start an info coaching business based on the math. We're going to be talking about why most people want to start these and if it makes sense for you to do. And then we're going to go through marketing, sales, and the fulfillment of the different business models and do real-time math on how much profit each one of them makes you. And if you stick around to the end, I'm going to go through ways that people have 100xed this and made big boy money from their info coaching business. Last year, we did 30 million in our info coaching business and we've done 72 73 million now in total in ours. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with same people doing cool [ __ ] All right, so let's get into it. Now, why most people want to do this? Simplest reason is just like they see easy money. Okay, it's just like, oh, why wouldn't I? And it is in fact an easier business model and can be easy money in compared to in comparison to a lot of other business models. All right. So, the first thing I'm going to ask though is like what is your goal? Is your goal to make another 100 grand a month? Is your goal to have a full standup company and then exit it and do all these different things? Like the most important thing is what is your goal before you start to do this? Because the next thing that happens down on this is your focus then veers into this. There are ways to limit it in terms of time and money that you do that and or the exchange of those. But the biggest thing is, and the reason that where I'm coming from with this is I saw and inserted myself on someone's tweet where they were asking like why, you know, how do you guys do this onetoone coaching thing? It just like sucks up this time, but I can make a couple hundred grand doing it a month. And it's like, you're correct. You could. You 100% could. But the focus and for somebody like that and for people like that who have a main business and then who are basically bolting on info coaching for people who want to pay them to learn from them, it can be a massive distraction. like massive massive distraction. If you're building a software thing, if you're running e-commerce, if you're doing lead gen like any of these things and right now you're spending of your working hours, you're spending 100% more or less on this one thing or if you're already one of those people who have like two or three businesses and you're spending 33 33 like across the different businesses, which is already probably not good and one could be bigger than all three if you just focused. This is adding another thing to it. There are ways to limit that and there are ways to decrease the amount of time you spend by paying people to do it, but then you're still managing them. So the time instead of costing time which is you know the biggest resource you then exchange that for money which means you make less profit on it and you still have to spend time to do it and a lot of the time in these smaller ones like you still got to spend the time in general because people are paying for you. You are the expert. So people do it for cash flow. People say they're going to do it and they're going to exit theirs or people who just have info coaching businesses. Hormosi made a video on this and I'll be talking about that a little bit later. He just had one that came out recent. like you know 99.99% of people do not exit these businesses. There's like more or less like three that I can rattle off that actually sold and not big numbers and hormones even says on his it's like a licensing company that he sold and and they call them education businesses instead of info coaching. It's like you know similarish. Uh and I'll get into why they're sold and how they sold because he talked about it in a video. That's a direct copy from that and then I'll talk about like 10 other examples of cool ways that people have done it um not to sell but to make literally 100x down here at the end of the video. But exiting it's just like don't even account for it. Unless you're doing something that's like the 0.01% you're not going to exit. So it's strictly a cash flow game and that's why you're doing it. Um it is easier than a lot of businesses. There's no doubt about that. like spinning up like an events business even or even some of the physical e-commerce stuff with you know fulfillment and having to do like there's it's an easier business model the cost to fill generally is like or the the method of fulfillment is generally speaking time or pre-recorded or like a one to many situation which is easier um and then I would urge you to really only do this if you are expert in the field uh if you are a lot of people in this like info coaching game sell to each other so it's like info person selling to info person or like online marketer selling to online marketer and it's like this vicious circle and like I hate it. I'm not a fan of it. Like I mean we've bought them for sure. Um I buy everything like that but I don't know it just like kind of rubs me wrong versus like being an expert to of in XYZ niche and using online marketing to fuel it. So example fitness. I heard somebody talking about like a a gardening one that was doing over seven figures. Dog walking or dog training I'm sorry not walking that was doing over seven figures. Being an expert in the field and then bolting on the online marketing I think is like the real pure way to do this because you're just maximizing you know you're throwing a magnifying glass on that expert's thing demand are people already asking for it for examp like you know we have our expert for example gets plenty of DMs asking for coaching or onetoone or this and that um you know people ask me for consulting like there's a demand for it already or you are solving a problem it's all comes down to solving a problem like can you provide the value and solve the problem and then time versus money kind quickly talked on this already, but the different models and how you do this or if you even do this is a time and money exchange. So, a lot of the time these business models are are expend on your time for money. So, it's still like a you still have an hourly rate when you do this and everything you do has an hourly rate. So, like knowing that going into this and trying to optimize it for where you make 10 grand an hour versus you make $150 an hour, like you need to think about that going into this. And then when you replace yourself and pay people to do it, you're limiting your time, but you are increasing the cost to have it managed for you and decreasing your profit. Not necessarily a lot. You can do it in good margins, and I'll get into that right here. So, marketing the I'm just going to bucket these in three very simple ways. There are more than this, and don't [ __ ] on me for that. There. I'm just going to say marketing, sales, and fulfillment because it's simple and that's what we're going to use. Okay? Okay. And those are the three core buckets that I'm going to use on my opinion. So, marketing, organic versus paid. Now, ours is 95% paid. Okay. Now, when you have paid, you have a large cost or a cost, not necessarily large or depending how you how you run it is uh either percentage large, but organic. Now, all of these [ __ ] guy, not all, a lot of these [ __ ] guys, a lot of these things, these guys, they get to a couple hundred grand a month, they are able to do that strictly on like a warm audience on following they have built on either X, on Instagram, on YouTube or wherever, and they don't need to run ads. Now, why that is good is because in your units and in your overall P&L, your marketing expense, sorry if I'm glitching, it's because you don't subscribe and because I haven't swapped to my new laptop yet. I'm sorry. But um the organic versus paid. Paid is a large size. So when you hear people talk about rorowaz and it's 2x or it's 5x. It's like that is how much you spent on ads to how much you returned from ads which generally speaking is like a majority of your revenue if you're doing it. Not necessarily but like it could be 20% it could be 40% of your revenue and it directly eats into how much profit you have okay or your cash collected. So in this model we're going to talk about this real quick. So, acquisition funnel, this is a very simple VSSL opt-in funnel. And this is the math behind it. So, let's say you get a lead for $30. Of that, of those people who opt in to watch your VSSL, 20% of them apply. Of the people that apply, 50% of them book a call. So, now it cost you $300 to get someone on the phone. Then, 55% of them show up for the for the call. So, it cost you $545 to get a live call. And then you close 25% of them. It cost you $2,000. $2,200 actually to get a new purchaser. Okay. Now, if that person is paying you $8,000, which is not crazy high in the high ticket space, but like definitely more than your $27 ebook, $8,000 over the phone because it's that high of ticket. Generally speaking, and I'm going to get into that in these, generally speaking, that means that you need to pay a sales rep because you are not because you're using a sales team. Now, this is that time versus money thing. I'm going to continue to go back and forth with if you are taking the calls, you do not have a cost for it other than your time. Okay? Now, in this model, I just said 55% of them show up. So, you now have blocked off, we'll use 50 on this so it's easy, but like two hours of your time. Let's say only one showed up. And really what it is is one in four of the live calls. So, you had to take eight calls roughly to get this one unit. So, you just spent eight hours to get one unit and make eight grand in cash collected. Then you spent two grand on ads, which netted you $6,000, assuming that there is no sales team because you did it. And the fulfillment is all your time as well. So, you just made six G's in eight hours roughly, let's call it, based on how long you took on sales calls. Now, you have to fulfill on this and coach with them. And what is your hourly rate? So, let right like now you spent the eight hours here. How many hours are you going to spend to work with the person and get them the result of why they're paying you? And we're going to go through the different models of fulfillment versus the sales versus the marketing. It it can get spread out. And if you're running an ecom business, if you're running a like any of these other things, it's like why are you doing that? So most people are not going to be if you're that small and if you're in that model, you're not going to have metrics like this because you're not going to be running paid. So in this what what would happen with an organic and someone like Eman talks about it how they have 70% margins on their net net net like not gross like their net margin is 70% which is like on 70 million which is just nutty. So for them it's going to be a zero ad cost. Okay. Because and it's not actually zero because if you want to account for it the right way or whatever it's like how much do you pay your team to actually do the content or even if you're doing the content like what's the time cost on that? But in literal dollars of this, if you're not including team that you pay to do it or you just pump out all your own content, an organic sale does not have any ad cost or marketing cost directly. Okay. Sales team, this one can vary, but like we'll call it 10%. And fulfillment, depending on the model, which we'll get into, it's 10%. So that's where you're making your 80% here. And then another 10% goes to your overhead that is lean as can be and you're making 70% margins. Okay, now that's the difference on the organic versus the paid. So being able to do it with an audience. Now the thing there is if you do not have consistency in growth of the audience through organic methods, it you would like to depend on paid to scale. The thing with paid is it is consistent. Organic can be consistent for sure depending on like content outputs and like knowing your numbers on what where you sit on like engagement rates and um conversion rates of different pieces of your organic audience. Um but that's just like a general gist. Now sales direct versus over the phone. A lot of people cap it at 2K. I have, you know, I mean, I personally bought stuff up to 15 grand without talking to somebody. So like what I mean here on sales is direct versus phone. So a lot of people will sell something that is $297, call it. Oops. $297, call it. They have no sales team because they're selling direct. So what I mean by this is like either running ads or organic. All these can be interchangeable. You can have an organic phone funnel that only does community or this. And you could do a paid funnel that does phone that does direct but does like like there's these different options. So, we're mixing and matching. I'm trying to give you examples. So, the phone version is on a sales team. You would not sell it this low. You could not sell it this low because the math in order to sell something over the phone on just just a 20 $297 unit doesn't make sense for how much you then would be able to pay a sales rep because on average you're going to pay a sales rep 10%. When you are using an outsource agency it's 20% to pay a sales agency and that's why you're using high ticket and when you're running it in-house you're going to call it 15 to 17. So we'll just throw 17 in here. Okay. Now, with direct, there's no sales team and the fulfillment is dependent on these different models down here. Okay? But like, let's say it's zero. You're basically making all this because you organically sold somebody. You posted on in your community or on your Facebook or I'm sorry on your on your Facebook on your uh Instagram or inside your on YouTube and a thousand people bought this thing and you didn't have to spend any money in ads. You didn't have to sell anyone over the phone on a sales team and the fulfillment cost you basically nothing because you're selling a community. So you essentially just made 297 per pop and then the only thing is then the cost to fulfill on it which is either your time one to many in a community or you pay a coach or someone for community management plus a little bit of you. And that's how a lot of these guys in that model works for the WP communities uh for the Discords for the different things like that is it's the collection of people. It's a direct to cart so you don't have to talk to anyone on the phone. So fulfillment is extremely low. There's little to no ads at all and there's no sales team. So that is how they can basically only have overhead thereafter which is how much they pay the lean team. The fulfillment is you know one to 5% call it with like course uh with uh community managers things like that. But that's the gist. Okay. So direct first phone. Now if you're selling something over the phone uh what example do we use 8,000 and you're selling it organic your sales team like I said we're going to use the in-house number. 17% of it that includes managers that includes setters that includes everything. A normal sales rep's 10ish, call it maybe 10 to 12. W2 add 20%. Manager add two three points. Uh setter basically the same cap 2 to three plus two. So like you can get up to 17 to 20 real quick. And then I specifically know agencies that either do it for 20 or 25 of the net new rev. Okay. Fulfillment. Now if you are selling for something for $8,000, fulfillment's next on this. But on average for service, you're going to keep it under 20%. Okay? And this is an the example of you. It's organic. You posted. You went through this to get someone onto the phone. They booked in. And then it cost $1,300 to pay a commission to a sales rep and the whole team. And it cost you $1,600 to the coach, the community manager, the people on the background that are fulfilling on it. Now, again, this is at scale when you have like a big business because normally this is going to be like way lower because it's either your time that you're selling for $8,000 or like group time and it's still just like extremely limited. So again, pretty solid margins. Next, fulfillment. Two different types of things that exist here. So like education industry-ish is info coaching. I'm simplifying and this is my interpretation. So info is going to be like your consumable. So a lot of people will sell a course, a community or like group. Okay? And that's and a lot of the time it's all of them. So you'll get login access to a group where you have like trainings and education to learn the thing. You have a community that goes side by side to ask questions about it and like as you go through the course material and then you have group coaching calls which are like that little bit of personalization to have Q&A that's not like a support inbox. I know people who just sell course. I know people who just sell community. I know people who just sell course plus community with no calls. I know people who just sell calls. Like you can interchange these however you want. And you need to be able to make sure you do your math on what it's going to cost you fulfill because a course cost you b literally nothing the time to do it. Okay. And then the hosting cost of Kajjabi or wherever you use or school. Community is going to cost you your time and then either you're going to upgrade people from the community to manage it or you're going to pay a community manager to do it. And then group coaching is either going to be your time one to many which is extremely scalable to a pretty high range or you are going to pay a coach to do the group coaching calls which is also one to many. So still you're paying one person x amount of time for many people. All right. Now, next piece of this, and again, all that in to keep the math up to date in this $8,000 example, an organic sale, a sales team that happened because it's a higher ticket thing. You couldn't sell it direct. I have bought things for more than 15 grand just with an order form. So, not saying it can't be done, but generally speaking, over 2K, you're going to be selling it um you're going to be selling it over the phone. So, you're gonna have a sales team. So, let's put the sales team here. And all these things I was referring to are either zeroing this out if it's just like a login access it. And then if you have group coach, you have to pay a community manager, whatever, it's 2%, it's 5% depending on the volume. Because $160 is not what you're paying the person. You're paying the person 40 grand or 26 grand or whatever number you're paying them. And then it's spread out across however much volume you are doing per unit. Okay? That per unit decreases if the person is making a flat fee. If the person is making 2% of every person that comes in, it stays 2%. Okay, hopefully that makes sense. Now, fulfillment in coaching, there are four different layers here. And you have coaching that is onetoone. So that is someone who is paying you $50,000 or $10,000 to literally work with you directly. Now, in that model, someone's paying you 50 grand. Oops. Generally speaking, there is no ad cost on this or it's later in a funnel that already happened. So, it's like the p top of the of the uh funnel of like or the ascension ladder. It's the top. So, you've already liquidated ad costs. So, zero ad costs. A sales team likely is happening or they're talking to you directly to buy. So, it's either 15% or zero. And then fulfillment in terms of actual dollars is zero. Okay. When it's one to one. Now, this is a massive time suck. And in the direct answering of what someone was posting about, I was like, "How do you guys do onetoone coaching? Like, I feel like I could do that, but I just don't have the time." It's like, yeah, exactly. So, are you going to trade off making 200 grand and feeling the indebtedness because someone paid you 50 racks to want to then to try and help them get the result they want? And the reason they're paying you 50 is to make more than 50 in whatever value exchange. Whether that's literal in terms of monetary, they pay you 50 cuz they want to make 200 or they pay you 50 because it's going to change their health or their relationships or their whatever. Like if you do not get them the result, not a good thing. Okay? So like you're going to put x amount of time into this to make sure they do it and that is going to distract you back to our focus thing from your main business where you're making money in physical e-commerce or as a yoga practitioner or as a or like you know or scaling whatever. Okay? Okay? So, it's going to take away your time because you're going to be focused on helping these people do it in exchange for $50,000. Okay? Like, simply put, that is what you are doing. So, that's a one one example, and that's where someone is going to pay you the highest dollar value in your ladder. And there are other like kind of offshoot things, but like in this example, we're just going to use these four. The one is the peak of the pyramid. you can charge the most amount of money and people are paying the most amount of money because they have access to you and they have the highest likelihood of getting the result versus if they buy a $27 ebook that you produce, they do not think they're going to get the personalization, the one-on-one, the the likelihood of them being able to follow through on it or the value of how they look at it is $27 versus how they look at something that is $50,000. Okay. Now, next one too many. So, this is changing the fulfillment style as well as the offer. So in this you are doing group coaching okay and in that let's say you can charge 25,000 not $25 you can charge $25,000 okay or what's more realistic is maybe a 12k program and again these there's so many depths to this this is this is six-month range is this you know some of these big guys charge $1820 or whatever for six-month access right now and it's a group and it's coaching calls that are mixed with group and the person and it is a community and like that's it. I think I said the same thing once but like and there's like a little teeny course that's attached to it and they charge 20 grand and it's a six-month thing because everyone focus on recurring now which I'll get into later but one to many the difference here is somebody is now going on and they have to like bid for your time. Now whether this is in community or this is on live calls in this example I'm talking about live calls. So now instead of you doing oneto ones with this person and only having your time one hour to their one hour where they're trading 50 grand like people like Cardone I've heard have charged like 200 grand or 250 for like three hours. I don't remember the exact number so don't quote that but it was definitely over 100 and it was per call it was it was I'm pretty sure it was over 100 per call maybe 180 for two I don't know something like that but it's high and that is for uh coaching direct consulting calls because people can pay that because they think they're going to make or they know they're going to make and that's the thing they the highest likelihood that they are going the highest likelihood of result that they're going to make more than 100 grand from the hour of what they learn on the one to one piece the next for this one to many is them getting on a call where there's 15 or is there 40 or is there 200 people that are all going to you one to many instead of one to one where they are trying to get their same result but they know they have to bid for the attention. They're asking questions in the box like yes it's you answering but is it onetoone? Is it direct communication and feedback? No, it's not. Or are they in a group chat where you will answer but they're also answering a bunch of other people versus onetoone texting someone. So it's different. The value is perceived different. You can charge less money. Okay. Keeping everything the same. No ads, no sales, no fulfillment. Okay. Now, coach onetoone. This is where instead of having you do this, you have coaches. So, your coaches do a one-to-one call with them. Um, and this is generally speaking also a little bit lower. And we're using like the true expert model here because at scale on like a real business that runs this, and not to say they're not real businesses, anything that you know, whatever. It's not they are real businesses, but the ones that are at scale already are at these models. And I'll show you an examples of that. But a coach onetoone generally this is like when you're pumping you're doing a lot of these there's no way that you are doing one to one. So instead of you doing one to one you have coaches doing oneto ones and you have 10 coaches or 50 coaches that do this and they go onetoone and that is the next tier down on the ladder where they'll pay pay nine grand for six-month access where they get onetoone attention from a coach and they get all these other things. They get the course, they get the community, they get the coaching, but they get onetoone with a coach. Again, highest likelihood they're going to get the result. they're cool with it. Now, the next on the ladder is one to many, and that is a group coaching style again, but where the coach is the person instead of you as the expert of the person, which then can be broken into cohorts and pods, and you can have one group, one group coach with 10 people in it instead of one coach with one person on it. Okay? So, you see as we're tiering down this that is call it three grand. I'm just using examples on this. We're just dropping it as we scale down because that is the how the value is perceived of these and the likelihood to get the result drops as you do this. But eventually there's like a floor and that's where kind of these numbers land and it's dependent on your industry, your space. If you're, you know, in yoga like I said versus dog versus like make money online, vastly different dollars because it's what your market is, where they value it and what the return is, the ROI justification either emotionally or literally in terms of dollars. So now I'm going to give you an example of at scale how this looks. So let's say for our program we're charging 8 grand. The ad cost is this number up here. Sales team is actually 17% let's call it an inside team and fulfillment is 20%. What this is is someone is paying for a onetoone coach where they also get community. They're paying for onetoone coach for six months or a year let's just say. Okay. So, they're paying $8,000. We are using all paid advertising to do this and spending large sums of money a day to consistently acquire clients because we do not have an organic pool. So, it's costing us $2,200 to get a customer. It is then costing us $1360 in sales, sales management, setter, whatever. And then it's costing us $1,600 to pay this coach that does onetoone work. Okay. Now, gross profit on that is 35%. So, you make $2,800 of that 8 grand in this example. Now, I don't know about you, but as you scale up a team and go through 35% gross before overhead, before software, your marketing team, your all the pieces that do not fit into either your ads, your sales team or overall sales or your fulfillment team. Everything else that happens in your business is an overhead expense in simple math or simple in this example. Okay? It's going to be generally speaking. you're gonna need a lot of units or you're going to want to increase that percent because you're only making 2000 bucks 2,800 bucks of that 8,000 or you have other offerings or you have these other things but like I'm just giving you an example of selling one offering in this. Okay, now people who have done this I hope this all makes sense. Um I just yapped for 24 minutes and it's just so important to understand like the differences in these and how the percents or the the pieces like cuz if you don't have paid you you know you could save 30 points off this, right? If your ads are that, it's almost 30%. So you drop 30% to the gross profit line and then that water falls down. If you do paid, now you know if you do direct versus phone, phone teams, you know, are going to cost 15%, 10%, 20% depending on the number. The fulfillment, this is going to have little to no cost to fulfill. This is going to have a lot of time to fulfill. And this is going to have a lot of cost to fulfill. It's like what's the tradeoff? So like should you start one or not? Yeah, go ahead spin one up. like you're going to lose focus on what you're actually doing if you're doing something big and if you you should be doing this. The only people I think should be doing this are people who are experts who are already doing something big anyway. So, it's a cash flow game. You can easily make a couple hundred grand a month doing this. FYI, but ways to 100x this talked about this and what something actually sells. He sold his and he talked about this literally in a podcast yesterday. So, I'm like directly ripping this. So, shout out him. I watch all of his [ __ ] I'm like it's perfect. Uh it fits how my mind thinks. So for him, the whole point is like recurring value and that's what that's the part that sells. So like why people come back. Um so in this model that 8K, let's say is the six-month membership and people are obsessed with it. It's like the best thing ever. They need it. They get the one to one touch point. It's what helps them get the result because that's what they're paying for and they want to do it forever. And you know your turn 15% and you keep most people and you have a constant inflow. Like that's valuable because it's recurring because future cash flow is predictable. Okay. Now, what's valuable in the examples he gave? I'm literally pulling this from his podcast. I listened to the plane home yesterday. He talks about how like there's like hot lists like so different things in like real estate or different things in um like he used another example of like you know product blueprints or something where people can like basically the like the creation portion of a p of a business model. Those coming out recurring are what people continue to pay for. It's like they're having a subscription to get access to new information that comes in. So, same thing people do with like uh financial newsletters and like updates on markets or whatever. They pay for that data and that information and that's why it's valuable is because it's consistently you can you can predict that that cash flow is going to be into the future because people are consistently paying for it because the product is valuable and it refreshes itself which inherently makes the recurring aspect as well. Okay. Ads another one. And so when he talked about the gym launch example, he was talking about how they were refreshing, they were basically testing, launching, and uh, you know, validating ads and then they were like launching them inside the thing. And same thing, it's like it's consumable. So like those ones die, new ones come out and they're giving it to the community. And that community is paying X amount for recurring month over month to get new access to that, you know, the what's working now essentially of ads. And likely, you know, I don't know his business model or what it was, but like he [ __ ] crushed it, so like doesn't matter. But you know the nine other things that he was offering them that were refreshing and education and access and all those things. So they sold for whatever 40 million 50 million something like that. So what's valuable and then the bigger game of this is let's say this is okay. Let's say it's kind of a distraction. You make a couple hundred grand a month which is like fine and it does you know a little bit of time distraction. You keep working on your main thing. Generally speaking that's not the case. Here are three examples of people who are doing this that are both making money on this and also crushing it with a bigger backend. Okay, private equity. I know a guy that's doing this with like operations and different pieces of that that is running an info coaching offer is doing great numbers in gross profit, net profit and now it just needs to focus on scaling it and on the front end uh which is the paid side versus the organic because there's not a community. So there's going to be ad expense there and then has to hire sales team because it's high enough ticket that has to be over the phone and then the fulfillment is very dialed because he already has that. So it's like 5%. Okay. So the bigger play there though is let's say he makes 30% net on the entire company and does a million bucks makes 300K. The bigger play is those customers are then people he wants to actually buy their businesses into the future. And when he buys their businesses depending on how he scales and does and sells it for later or the cash flow like it's a 100x play. So like the info coaching is a feeder to a bigger business model that's into the future. Life insurance I know a guy who basically I know two different or three different actually uh people who did this but they sell a course it's like on money management on like wealth preservation on retirement like there's these different angles to do it because life insurance has different angles of why people do it and different messaging points on why people would do it. They sell the stuff. They make some money or even no money on the info on getting them in. And then they all end up buying insurance on the back end, which is a high highly commissionable depending depending there's different commission ranges, highly commissionable product. So they make all of their money on the actual being an insurance agent and they float it and do acquisition through insurance uh or I'm sorry through info and coaching. And they do make money there actually. And then they have clout and like brand name and all that. And then they make the most of their money on that. And then there's 19 other ways to extend LTV through referrals and whatever. But just as an example, all this bigger game is just like increasing the back end. Um, Hyros, they talked about this, but Becker, you know, shut down his info coaching and his other stuff to run Hyros, but he also like we bought it uh a course he was selling that was like a Trojan horse of he made money on it for sure, uh, like in the info coaching business and then was basically pushing everyone to use Hyros and all talked about Hyros when it was newer and we bought it and it was great software. So like no nothing bad about that. Um but that was exactly what that was. It was like a feeder. It was he was doing info coaching to cash flow I'm sure both cash flow the actual business and like starting the business as well as then get new customers into the software and platform that were directly in market and then those you know Hyros took off. He sold that thing for nine figures like or a portion of it or whatever. So it works. It works. Um and yeah I this was I didn't even realize this 30 minutes long. Um, I hope you understand the concepts of what I'm getting across here. And like I do these videos cuz it helps me understand more. And every time I do this, I'm like, "Okay, how could I do this better?" And when I think through these numbers and talk these out loud, I'm like, "Oh, that's 17. Like what if that was 13?" Or like, "What if the closing was 35% on average?" Like that kind of stuff is huge and at scale it makes a big big difference. So hopefully this was helpful. Sorry this is like a yap session of 31 minutes. Um, daily update. I'm back in the cave and I will be here for a long time. www.ryanclog.com/docck has all the videos I've made. That video of all of us just shooting the [ __ ] at the event in Dallas has the most views on my entire channel, which is just kind of like hilarious. Uh, and I think the most likes. So, yeah, we're just building. I have some fun updates coming soon, but I'm inking them before I talk about them. And yeah, so new laptop. I got to figure out how to back the other one up and do all that stuff and migrate that over. But I appreciate you guys as always. Hopefully I didn't yap too hard. Please give me some feedback on that. I could have been more direct with this and had this done in like 5 minutes, but it would not have been as in-depth or many examples or things. But maybe that's what better. So let me know and hit me on IG or X for communication. Talk soon.

# we made 1.62M in april... here's how. | E51
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAM1eCgzWIg

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we did 1.62 million in cash collected last month and why that blows. I'm going to do a quick recap of where we were in years prior and then we're going to break down what went right and what went wrong last month and where we are changing things. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected and we've done 72 million 73 I think now uh million in cash collected in this business in total. And I'm not selling anything. Everything on this channel is sharing what did work, what didn't work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. all the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. So let's get into it. So in 2022 we were at 690K 23 695. Last year we did 2.75 and again that was the year we did 30 million and this month last month was 1.62. All right. So not good. Not in the right direction based on where the team size is. Not good, right? Um, so as you can see on this, like the slight down tick here, we've been trending at around that rate for the first few months of this year. All since around Q4 of last year, so acquisition broke. And if you watch other videos on the channel, I talk about how acquisition broke. And now we're in a situation where sales is there, marketing is there, and sales is not. So as you can see here on this chart, we have 110k days, 105, 100, 105, 10 whatever, and then like 30 or 50. It's like the most inconsistent thing you've ever seen. But that's good to know that when they are doing good, it's the same lead quality, it's the same volume uh and they are backing out to over 100 which is on pace for that three million. We just need consistency. So what went right marketing? So what we are currently w uh running inside the marketing team is this. We have a VSSL funnel is going to be along this top here. So optin page name, email running to a VSSL page. We have splits of these going on of different VSSLs as well as different opt-in pages going to an application page which we splited our way out and then changed routers that go through to qualified bookings and disqualified bookings that land in different buckets of closers based on their um close rates and like that where they're tiered. They land on success pages and then go to a sales call with a closer where then they are sold and go to terms. Okay, so that's going to be your VSSL funnel. The DTA is essentially a direct to application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL, but you're it's headline VSSL app button under it pop up and you apply right there. So, you don't have to it's non-gated, so you don't need uh the opt-in to get there. I have other videos talking about where the pros and cons of these different funnels. This one gets higher throughput um but sometimes does not get as high as quality depending on how well you do with framing and it just doesn't push as much consumption or add as much friction. Okay, so we're running this one right now testing. We have three of these going. one is like a clear winner amongst those three. Um, so we actually just toggled to just run that one. And then we have other variations coming out that may push more consumption like button uh delays, stuff like that. And that runs here and then runs through that same routing process. And then the low ticket, we have a low ticket funnel that is a two-step. So first page is a sales page. They begin the checkout with name, email, go to the checkout page, you get an opt as a lead. Then they check out, they then book direct in. I have other videos talk about this again but I talk uh pretty extensively about this where it's an ascensionbased funnel not a uh front-end profitable focused funnel. So it is not optimized for AOV like you always yes want to get AOV higher but the more important thing is ascension through the next steps which is booking with a setter setter booking to a closer closer closing them okay and I have other stats where I talk about stats of these uh I'm sorry other videos talking about all the stats of these and those are the three funnels that we're currently running in the value vortex okay so those are the three setters are grabbing auto sets self sets and confirm sets so this is all new to us um last month I believe was the first we started maybe it was end of the month prior. Um, but they are officially now claiming all marketing bookings directly. So, doing call confirmations. We took off the call center that was doing uh 20our day, 7-day a week calls uh for us to confirm bookings. They are doing self-set, meaning the classic run through the CRM, find them um dial 100, get five, your pick up five, you know, one set. And then auto set are those implementation quick start calls that happen post uh low ticket booking. Okay, so we're running all three of those. We scaled the team to like 15 or whatever it is right now already. Uh, and that is cranking along. Now, we're hearing stats on what they should be, what they shouldn't be, more outbound dials, all these things. I don't know. All I know is it's getting us 40, 50 sets a day. Um, which is high, right? And it just drives down that cost per booking uh as like a blended number. Okay. Booking volume has been steady on the tail end of this month over like over half the end of this month. it's uh you know whatever quick number 100 150 200 whatever the numbers um of booking volume that's steady day over day reviews push we had like one lower review come through and we were like let's just try and flood it out and we did our process that I have another video on that talks about how we do review collection we pushed that and got hundreds of reviews and we hit like a new tier for us on all that which is great across all of the socials backend buildout this is huge I will do another video on this once it's live or kind of the plan for it when it is But we're at this Anik uh Singal Expert Summit event right now. And this was like kind of one of the main pieces of what he talked about, which is essentially you're doing acquisition that liquidates a little bit. So call it 50% of that. Then they're selling they're moving through the funnel to a higher like core main program, a 5K, a 10K, a 30K, whatever your main offering is. So you liquidate a portion, cash trough until you get to there where you actually make some profit. And then on the tail end of that is where you have your recurring, your mastermind, your low ticket. Just something that is recurring. It's built in that is membership that is very sticky. Um some people do it with software. It's like a Trojan horse style thing. Um but either way, that is where the profit comes from. That is where the baseline comes from that can cover all of your operating expenses. So quick math, let's say it's $300 a month. You get 3,000 of them. You're making 900 to whatever a million depending on pay plans or things you decide to roll out. And that is covering a million bucks a month in overhead that you would have depending on your gross margin on that which generally speaking is like 99% because it is a one too many if anything cost to fulfill on that back end ideally if you build it correctly. So we are building one of these out. We've never had one. The only thing we've ever had on the back end is just buy more of the same stay for another year do that. So I think this going to be huge for us. It's also a piece of the puzzle that is goes into the enterprise value where you have recurring, you have community, you have growth there when right now ours is like single termed where it's a year. This one is continuous. It is recurring. It is there is year options and pay plans but it is continuous. So that SEO we did some fun stuff here. We got some scores up to like 100. We have a bunch more traffic that we're getting on the pages that we want to be getting traffic. So, it's actually not that much more in terms of like actual clicks and open or I'm sorry, clicks and sessions um that we're getting, but it is the higher intent and for the keywords we want, which we've never ever focused on. So, this is cool. Show rates those climbed. I did videos on this, but we have hammer them strat going. We have now with the setters. Setters have the craziest show rates I've ever seen. Like on certain stuff, it's like 80s and 20 plus percent live call, which is like double for us, which I know is bad. I'll get there. Um 100k days. I talked about that brief, but again we are these are 100k 100k 100k I think that was like 95 I don't even remember but I think that was 95 but this is terri this part's bad and I'll go into that in the what went wrong but back into 100k days we had a bit there where we were not and it was just sweaty not cool um because again for those of you who are new here why this really blows is because this is basically like break even at these numbers just because team is so big and the team is built to be doing three plus a month three to five a month um on the operational side There's some stuff that would scale up in terms of fulfillment, but all those costs are pretty lock. It's just the overall arching team. Everyone's W2, not 1099. We're built like a real business on an offer and it's still when we have these low dips, it's not good. So, hiring and sourcing using everything that we view you that is happening here on YouTube with my stuff as well as just the company being so branded, so well done and like known in the space, we attracting top talent for everything. So, I made posts. We're trying to hire a sales manager. we got the top top top people. Um, and we have been filtering through those. And it's just cool to see that what we're doing here, what I'm doing here with the YouTube stuff and X and whatever is paying off for that. And then also, like I've made in other videos, our chief of people is like a rockstar when it comes to this. So, we already get good talent in that way. This was just kind of like gasoline on it and more specific to our industry for the marketing, acquisition, sales side of things, which is like kind of the pocket that we live in. Um, so that's been really good networking event. We're at an event right now in Dallas. Met a ton of cool people. I've always been like in the cave and the quiet one and it's nice to go to these and meet people and go to the dinners and have fun. Learned a ton of stuff. Um, a ton of stuff and the little things at certain levels can be two, you know, the two, five, 10% lifts can be millions of dollars when done correctly. Um, and then splits on splits. This is just kind of a joke, but we're constantly running new splits. We launched two new ones this morning. We launched three last week. We're constantly crowning things or finding them. And then also trying to make sure I say that in the same breath as like there's such thing as splitting your way to zero where you just continuously try and split test split test until at some level there's like non continuity or like congruency across things and it breaks things. So we're trying to be cognizant of that but for us with the three different funnels it's pretty easy to segment what is being tested and what's not and make sure that there is continuity across them. So splits on splits what went wrong sales for booking CPA consistency financing numbers more things went wrong than this. I am absolutely sure of it. I have to get on a plane so I'm being quick. Uh but that is basically all sales. So for us for a long time it was marketing marketing marketing marketing marketing. You know we kind of are more of the people who believe in like one thing being the issue at a time like focus on one core thing. There's a million things going out of business very core departments that are constantly running and like achieving their things. But at some level there's always a bottleneck that is just like physics or something. It's it's there's always a bottleneck somewhere even if it's a little. And for us right now, it was marketing for a long time. Marketing is now in, CMO is now in. They're cranking. Um, setters now are in. Like the booking volume is there. The quality is there. And they are not backing out. So we have days like we lit a fire today and we're at I don't even know 12 something 13 14 unit like we're crushing today because we like lit a fire kind of thing. And that's not how it should have to be. It should just naturally be like that. So sales per booking CPA is a direct correlate to that because if you have a 15% versus a 30% live call close rate, it legitimately, you know, cuts your CPA in half. Um, so marketing is kind of waiting on being able to scale into bigger pockets. Um, because they don't have the feedback and the signals back on purchases. So even probably quality bookings that should theoretically close are not being closed at a consistent basis. So it is hard for us to know where in marketing that's happening. And then financing percentage. I just want to throw this on here. We went from we had like a a I think we Yeah, it was a firm setup we were using. Um and we went from a very high percentage, not very high, but like sub 50, but in that range of how many people were financing and we changed up terms and some things on it and it dropped to like 5%. And that one definitely hurt even a couple units a day. So I am working to figure that out and change that because even if we get it dialed in the goal should be around 25% is kind of like what we hear. I actually don't know but like so comment if you can tell me what your percentage should be for the best LTV because I'm trying to solve for what is the best percentage amount on first on front end like high ticket purchases not front end as in like AOV but like your core product which is technically your back end I guess but like we're talking about back end back end um what percentage of that should be financed to where you get the best LTV so obviously you're going to match terms so you know a 12-month plan to a 12-month plan or this or that but what is the best percentage that you would be allowed to do to maximize front-end cash while also planning out for who actually turns into higher LTV. So, that's something we're like thinking through and how we can do that, what offerings we should do, how much we should pay in fees in order to get people the line, all that. Um, so yeah, so that's where we're at. Um, biggest thing in sales right now, hiring sales manager. We have three core ones that we're talking to right now. I think we just found one that's a rockar. We were trying to just figure out, you know, math and comp and get where it where it needs to be. But the second we get that dialed in, then these become the norm. So if these already days can just happen more or less, and then these days happen, it's like if we can just stabilize around these, which is easy with the current volume, or even less. Like some of these days are 20% less in bookings and still close out the same. We do that. We're at three. And then it's just pushing more volume swapping, making sure that the sales team is where it needs to be and that the marketing can the marketing will then get the signals to know to be able to scale into the right pockets, which is then from three to five pretty easy. And that's just an arbitrary number. It could be five or six. And then all at the same time launching everything on the back end which will change this global number. But usually what we've been talking is about 90% new cache. And this will change that that this new launch will change that math. So we will have likely a higher portion of like active or non-new um cash. That will be great because it'll be higher margin or gross margin. And yeah, so that's where we're at. There's my daily update. made a doc on here. Made a funny video yesterday of all of us just talking in the room, all sitting there in black t-shirts for some reason on accident from dinner. So, sorry if that was douchy or egoey or something. I didn't mean for it to be. I was just we were just trying to have fun. We all sit in the lobby. We're like, "Oh, we might as well just do this in the room next to us." So, www.rycl.comdoc has every video. I'm on day 49 or 50 or something in a row of doing these. I'm trying to find top talent that want to come work with us and build cool And yeah, just kind of want to be able to look back on these and say, "Oh, wow. We were at 1.6 and now we're at 10. So yeah, that's where we're at. And hit me on IG or X and watch some of the other fun videos. Talk soon. But

# no mics. no scripts. just what's working... (raw Q&A) | E50
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSc0AhgBO0

In today's video, we are going to be doing something different and just do random Q&A with some random people I met at this event. All right, starting it off. What is one thing that's working right now in marketing, online biz, ops, any other things? Low ticket ascension offers. Low ticket ascension offers. Not an SLO. SLO selfquidating offers when people run you through like [ __ ] seven or eight upsells and downells to squeeze all the juice out of your ass. roll of it. Yeah. No, finding smart people is working. But low ticket ascension offer is you're you jam all the AOV into the checkout step and then you go right to the call because then you get 80% of people to book a freaking call after they buy and then it cuts your CPA to acquire a client. Like so you're not you're not doing upsells or anything. You're just trying to push everything in the cart. Not even right now. But yeah, but we will put everything on the Chico page. It'll be like radio button upsells. How many? Uh, two. But you can have three. I've seen people have five radio button upsell before. And I've had up to three add-on like order bumps, but I've seen one or two does best, though. Yeah. Next. Next. Who else got one? What's finding finding smart people and good people is working. It's a I think a timeless strategy. It's definitely working now. Where do you find them? Where do you find them? I made a whole video on this. Yeah, my Twitter. No, I made a whole video on this talking about private versus public hiring versus like sources. Like if you're hiring copyriter versus an HR director, like the nothing held back group, for example, is like this pocket of like people you can hire for this, but then you're not going to hire 92 other positions that, you know, from that. And then having good [ __ ] When you have good [ __ ] it's easier. Yeah. Good brand, good known. Yeah. It's have something substantial and be talented yourself. All right, Cody, what do you got that's working now? You're you're the only one that's not as online marketing e I'm not a online markete guy. Uh so I'm just going to go with just something like tactical and just like on the topic of hiring. So I'm just going to I'm just going to take that uh and run with it. So I would say something that that working and that I learned the hard way was correctly like giving the right titles to roles in your company. You know, a lot of times when I'll work with companies and it's like you go in and they're doing 700 grand a year and it's like they got a CFO, a CEO, a CMO, and a COO, but they're really just like a bunch of task runners. And so it's like I think it's important that you like actually properly give the right title because it's bad for the person and it's bad for you because if you if you you know hire your cousin and she's your bookkeeper and you call her your CFO then when you get to 3 million a year she can't do any CFO stuff and then you have to either fire her or downgrade her role which is also not fun to do. So um just correctly titling roles for the functions you actually do. I like that one. Solid. And in classic fashion, I'm not gonna dox or say anyone's name or anything or say what anyone does. Cody Barton. He's rich and successful. All right, we got that. Uh, what color is your lab? Yeah. What color is your label? One thing that's been working super well for Ascension. Uh, this is sending me into software to book a call. Anything is I I just call it like the one hour fast start cuz sometimes when people buy like a ebook or like a low ticket product, they don't actually consume it. So what people do is have like a video series to try to teach the philosophies and then sell them, but no one would even watch that. So what I do is I run a campaign. You could do it evergreener uh once a month, but we just say like, "Hey, you probably bought this thing. You probably didn't go in and watch it. We can actually see the stats. 90% of you didn't, but we want you to win so bad that we're hosting this workshop. It's one hour long and we're going to teach you everything you need to know to get started in one hour." So we get them on there. We teach them. It's a teaching webinar. You can it's pretty much like a normal webinar free and then yeah it's free just for buyers and so it's all buyers there and at the end you make your pitch say like hey this was great you know just like before you probably you might not do anything with this so get our done for you thing or get coaching get accountability whatever and so we just run those and then so I was talking to this other guy and he started doing one a week so there's four different calls and four main topics that are taught inside of that product and they're evergreen so you can use stealth webinar um I use I'm starting to use a events that's a Good one. And so buyers are getting a live stimulated Zoom call and you get on a Zoom call and a live. So you run it live once. Good idea. You record it and then but it looks like a Zoom. Yeah, it's on Zoom. It's called a Yeah, it's a high. So I talked to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A event. They work way better. Yeah. They're way better converting higher webinar jam easy web like because it's Zoom. So people like oh it's a Zoom call. We should jump on your thing on cuz also fitness it's like you not our Yeah. And at the end it's like, well, you flip it. It's the easiest argument to the back end because it's like, here's the thing. You had all this information in the course you bought, but you didn't do anything about it. What's going to change tomorrow? Book this call. Accountability. What's working for you right now, Ryan? Uh, well, you guys are on the same team as me and those two things are working. So, finding good people. The Ascension Funnel. Anyone who watches, anyone who's on this channel knows that the Ascension funnel is crushing for us right now. What else is working for us right now? What about your other fun? Like your other funnel is it still working fine? Your VSSL book call VSSL's. Yes. But we're using Blake's Sorry I do you. Uh you're uh using your value vortex situation. The one that's not working for us right now but like secretly is is the DTA. That'll that will which is our direct to app funnel, but I talk about that a ton. But no, here that actually rolls into this. Good. So the next one is what go-to tool or system are you using that's quietly driving results? So like that was a fire one. I didn't even know about that. Yeah. What about the thing you told us about the the lead content campaign? Yeah, I mean that's that's working right now is just bottom of funnel nurture towards leads and and apps who are um who have come through your funnel and are likely to book a call as far as like getting higher quality book calls in a sense, right? because you brought that up earlier which is like we were talking about like is that actually influencing it and I thought about that a little bit more which is we cut down the VSSL from like a longer VSSL to a lot shorter but one thing that I think to go back to your question was I think in a sense it is helping the lead nurture to book calls because there's a trust factor or a trust recession around leads who have gone through other coaching programs in the past and are worried about booking a call because they know that a call is not a strategy call, right, or a blueprint call, it's a sales call. So, I think the it can be in a sense like I I I do would like to dig into that data, but I am curious like if the people who are leads but haven't booked but have gone through the app, it's like getting the quality. Yeah. Yeah. It's getting the quality to book. So, this is like so everyone so everyone understands he's saying. So, I I've talked about like the hammer them. Shout out Jeremy Haynes. He talks about that where you're basically running testimonials, pre-objection block, stuff like that as video views between when someone's booked and when they get on the phone call. He's talking about doing it prior to the phone call for people to get on. But still no like retarget where you're sending them to directly to book. You're just literally just in their face all the time with what kind of content? Just belief shift, objections, whatever is going to come up on the sales call basically. That's interesting. Authority content. authority content speaking on stage. Yeah. So like this is interesting like we don't do this. So like us rolling this out could be like a two five 10% lift and like that's opportunity. Opportunity lift, dude. And then I think just like a timeless thing to bring up too is it is shocking how many people because I did some cult consulting with people who are trying to scale like some low ticket funnels or VSSLs or whatever and it's shocking to me how many people don't actually run like financial models or economics on their funnel and they're like oh I need better ads. I need more creative. I need whatever. And it's like, do you really need that? Is it just like CRO? What are you doing? Oh my god. Get out of here. That was cloud chasing. Oh my god. Okay, that's good. No, but what else? Tools, systems, like tech. So, that was a good one. That's like a a tactic that would probably crash for us. I could plug another one. I mean, I got two ready, so go for it. All right. Uh, one we're we're going to roll out more is Hero Pixel just data enrichment. Uh, one thing we're going to try GTpper, it's a chat GT rapper. Uh, it's Faceless Digital. No, I'm joking. Um, but what we're going to try is after someone opts into our webinar. It's like what if before they go to the automated on demand version, we can pull their like see their how much they're making and based on how much they're making, we send them to a webinar where at the end there's a specific payment plan or financing or pricing that fits best for them. So, we're going to be rolling that out and segmenting it, but it's good for book a call. Just Hero Pixel. Oh yeah. Yeah. We we don't use it right now, but those lead guys um Douglas, they do that too. And we were talking about doing that, but we only thing that we would do for that is arm the sales reps with the data because we don't collect the phone number. You need name, email, phone number in order to pull it. So you'd either have to do it for us either post application or post purchase of the low ticket. And you can't real time route them. you like kind of can, but you have to do like a loading screen and all that stuff, which like it just seems like overkill right now. So, just give the sales reps to know how much total credit they had, how much like basically what's currently on there, and then also they have like this weird blended metric that's like what they could access for like a firm or CLA or whatever. We don't, but we for sure want to use it. It's like you either do it with more volume so you segment the leads you want to hit or you do it like you're saying like postpurchase for ascension or we'll just like scan our list before we do a webinar and then just we do like activation campaigns and we only run it to people who can afford it. So imagine you're only emailing people who can afford your backend offer. That's a good one. And it's just freaking you go all right guys. You only send it to them. You're like yeah. So you can get very specific because in today's age where whatever money isn't as accessible supposedly to people or they need to pay in different ways then I feel like it's going to be a big to segment where you're sending these people based on how much they can afford. Yeah. Because then it's not going to scare them away because even if you do a webinar we pitch the there's payment plans we pitch the 997 we see people bounce off because they're immediately afraid. But imagine if they jump on and we have a price point or payment plan that makes sense to them there and so the conversion rate will go up. We may not lose them as much or they won't be in the chat being like what the freak like like we even we saw I saw like Iman Gazi's recent launch he did when they dropped the price at 1,500 which isn't even that much like a business opportunity. The chat was just like they're all piss you know getting mad. Yeah. Have a video of it and obviously it's YouTube. public that doesn't reflect the the launch is crazy, but it just shows people's like me like what the they forget the bonuses and like what the heck they all mad. So this cost money. Someone at dinner last night was talking about how someone had like a call it 300ish product that was direct to cart and they blasted and did like over 20 and like did over 20 million just like pink doing that not on even like a live video series launch nothing like literally just a launch mid l and I was like what just like direct access and then community that's like just like evergreen not even like drip or nothing like that's wild one other thing I just thought of just on launches is um we so over the past year we've run challenges every month for one client. And one thing that we started to do for pre-qualification and also for show rates was just getting people to go through a quiz on the thank you page. That was that people do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Why do they do it? Yeah. So, it's we Yeah, we'll build a score app on the thank you page, but we kind of like rigged the the score app to be no one can get over like 65 or 70%. In terms of like their score and the quiz is framed as like a pain thing. So, it's like discover your own discovery. It's like discover how likely you are to build muscle or whatever and it's like they they just can't get over 75%. So then they feel like they need to show up in the What did Yeah. I was going to say cuz you Yeah. You built one that's on the back of So for us it's low ticket. I don't know this guy but found him in the hallway. It's uh ours is low ticket low ticket ops low ticket purchase then book a call that's like a quick start starter implementation whatever call and then on the thank you page of that is an app that you put on there that has free form questions and stuff. Yeah. So it's like an in it's positioned as like an intake form or an onboarding form and originally I made that form for a different offer and I I wanted to just get like market research data. So, I was like, "Hey, why did you buy it? Why did you almost not buy it? Why what were the bonuses that you were like most attractive to you?" And I was going to use that data as like market insights, which I did. But then I actually ran like a meta analysis on like all the buyers who filled that out. And they were about four times more likely to ascend into the backend or higher ticket products than people who did not fill out the form. And then I found an even higher correlation between first purchase order value. So like their initial AOV when they bought the low ticket and if they filled out the intake form they would have sent it like 11 point something percent versus like 3%. So can you do you think that's like it is there a way to make more people fill it out and it'll follow that or do you think it's just inherently like the people who do it do it like I don't know if it's causation or correlation but I think not having it is not a good idea. I've seen people do it even on I was wondering why it's there because people do on m like free webinars or even free challenges and I fill it out and nothing happens but it must be it must be doing something good or crushing. So um all right, what else we got on here? Uh what else on the tech side of things? We've got um we got someone else joining us here today. This is just raw. We're just shooting the show. Cool. Um, what else in software though? Anything else on that? Uh, I mean it's not really soft. I was say you're what are you using AI wise or something in in marketing media buying creative world? I love Claude right now for reviewing copy and making different voice styles. So you like you just take take like the VSSL or even like YouTube content or whatever, take the transcript and then make a style in Claude and then you just paste the raw text in like 30 minutes of somebody talking. It'll give you like an amazing voice and style and then if your copyriter wrote like a whole VSSL, which like we just did, then I can say, "Hey, like rewrite this whole thing in the voice and take it from like score it first and it'll say, "Oh, this is like a 70 out of 100." and I'll be like, "Cool, rewrite it so it's 100 out of 100 and bang on with this style and then you plug in the style, hit extended thinking and it'll just rip like a really badass VSSL or ad script or anything you want." Yeah, you were telling me about that the scoring one how you like scored the VSSLs. Yeah. Yeah. What is that based on though? Who's What did you feed the AI? So like who says it's a 10 or like 100? Shout out to Peter Kell. I do that all the time. I'm like, "Oh, we bought Peter Kell's course. We bought uh Jerry Aes and stuff." Like I buy I buy everything. Peter Kell's got like a a VSSL assistant like um prompt or whatever that he uses. But like even if you don't have a prompt, you can always say like, "Hey, based on the like if you're doing like a a web page." Actually, that's the thing I've been loving doing with CRO is screenshotting like the mobile above the fold of the funnel, giving it to Claude and then saying like, "Hey, act as if you're a conversion rate optimization expert with like 20 years experience or pretend that you're Chris Goward because that guy has like a sick book on CRO." and then like rate the conversion elements of the page out of 10 and then like give me suggestions on like how I can make this page way better and beat this as the control and then it'll give you all the suggestions and you just say hey can you mock this page up and then it'll literally like build a demo page like a wire design it'll design it right copy plug everything in you can like literally publish it as an artifact send the link to your funnel builder developers or whatever and they'll just have like a at least they can have a visual because usually You're giving like the funnel builder ideas like in writing, but if you can give them a visual. Yeah, that's interesting. And you don't have to like mess around in Figma for an hour. You can just do it. I'm going to I'm going to shut up about marketing after this, but something that everyone always asks me and I'm like this is not my expertise and like you two are going to know this. You're like all all of you were not going to know this as well, but like everyone always asks what is Yeah, same. Uh what is simply put like shortish answer on how you would like start a campaign or how you would basically do testing in the beginning like literal structure of the camp and like optimization on something for example let's just use the VSSL call funnel if you were running one from scratch how you would start it with testing like ad breakdown campaign and then once it's in scaling how you'd run that as if you'd run AVO you'd do CBO you break these loaded it it's not but like no no but seriously short It's a short answer. No, because there is there is a CBO. There is scaling CBO. But like No, honestly like because that's one that happens all the time and I'm like you can look at YouTube videos where people talk about this forever, but like I never say like in the trenches this is what's happening. Okay. Cuz I don't try your best. That's a long Okay, I'll see if I can go quick surf method. Yeah. Yeah. Just Yeah. Surf scale. Yeah. Surf. I forgot about that. That's like an OG, dude. 100k a day just dump dump a CV caps in like a thousand bucks maybe work. Come on. What is it? Okay, so like if you were to start whether it's like a low ticket funnel, callunnel, whatever, like from scratch. I personally have found the best results doing a [ __ ] campaign and it's like you're creative testing because like you don't want to just like throw all the [ __ ] at the wall. Plus, when you do graduate stuff to bigger scaling campaigns, Facebook actually just found this out on Monday talking to our Facebook rep that preheating ads is a thing in meta that they actually want you to validate spend on an ad before you move it to a scaling campaign. And if you ever graduate stuff like into your main campaigns that are already spending a lot, those ads usually won't earn anything if you like make them and they don't have spend behind them on the post ID. So anyways, it'd be like one campaign obviously, but it's on it's on [ __ ] So it's So it's [ __ ] and you just every single adset you have the same creative. So let's say you have five videos and two images or something. So you'd have seven adsets and every ad set is only that creative and it's the same creative in both ads. Uh, and then the only thing that's different is like the copy or the headline or just like a different variation of like the hook if you want or something like that on the creative side. And then every ad set has the same structure. So, it's like every ad set is two ads, but each ad is the same creative, just make a different copy variation of it. And like I've started those and you get like really good cost per call because the budget's lower. So you start the budget, by the way, really low because then you're forcing Facebook to just get you something for the spend. The the CPA is way lower. It's not sustainable, but then you'll at least find whatever ad creatives you can then use. So let's say out of those five videos and two images or whatever that you ran, one of the images pops and does really well and the CPA is really good and then like two of the videos are really good or three of the videos are really good. You take those post IDs and then you move it into a CBO at like a more ideal budget which is like whatever that calculation is. You try to reverse engineer your CPA so you can get 50 conversions in a week and on that campaign and that's why that's how you're choosing what you're optimizing for based on that. Yeah. Of the budget. Yeah. Yeah. Cody, is this making sense right now for your quiz? There's actually a challenge. It's rigged though, so you're never going to be put. Yeah. Yeah, it's rigged. Okay. And then you drop those in. To put simply, that's I mean, no, that makes sense though. Literally the amount of times that comments, DMs, whatever that people ask that and I'm like there are so many people like on YouTube that talk about this in so you like that I think fundamentally isolating variables. Isolate variables then you move them into the big campaign only when they're proven. Yeah. Boom. That would have been nice. Look at that. Boom. No, I know a dude who's literally doing that with a freaking low ticket. He's got no high ticket on the back end. Last I checked, 50k a day. I saw the seats and cash or uh that's just low ticket on the front end or whatever. No, that's a good one too. Nursing's also a good one too. 50k in like revenue cash. Yeah, cash day low ticket upfront profitable company. Um and he's doing he's I was like, "Bro, how do you run ads?" and he's like, "Oh, I just freaking throw in a CBO." And you just isolate a variable. Then you freaking throw in a scaling thing. He's like, "Yeah, I don't really know. I just make he's really good ads." All he thinks is, "How do I write really good ads?" He wakes up. It's kind of like Mr. Beast. He's like, "Make good videos." He's like, "Just make good VSSL ads. 10-minute VSSL ads. That's all he does." I'm like, "That's it." VST on platform. It is in health. So, you have to think about what's the market. It's health. It's not supplements. So, obviously, if I'm in like bisop or other things or relat, I probably wouldn't do that. But health specifically. and female market. I would do that for sure. Chill. Nobody running that market by the way. Uh if I was in All right. Doesn't work. We're bring Yeah, exactly. That market's terrible. They have no money. Um saturated. It's super. So bringing Cody back into this and then everyone What are we at by the way at minutes 22? Cool. What part of a current model you're running in your business or otherwise is not scalable? and what's your plan to change that? And that's just like the idea behind are you doing something on purpose that's not scalable or are you doing something on accident that you're just like we just have to do it? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. So I would say the the one thing that I'm doing right now that's not scalable is I'm going to more events and speaking and you know doing things like that to you know just kind of ramp up uh one of the businesses that I'm involved in um as I'm working on paid ads on the back end just to get you know more momentum going. So I don't see it as scalable because I the life that I'm designing doesn't involve me going to events very frequently. Uh, so it's not scalable because I choose to not want to do that. Um, so that that would be the biggest thing. And then what was the other part of the question? Well, then I guess that you already kind of answered it. The plan to replace that is you're doing paid ads in the background. Yeah. Doing paid ads in the background. And I think I think I mean for for anyone like in getting their offers up off the ground, I think, you know, organic and just like just brute force at the beginning really can just get momentum going. Um, but yeah, so I think that's that's the thing I'm doing right now that don't want to do longterm, but is a good short-term thing. Yeah. No, that's that's fair. You you said ours before this, but I think it's funny. What the what you think is not scalable that we're currently doing with the lift ticket? No, I actually I think that uh if I was to answer that, I would actually say that VSSLs are not as scalable as people think. And if they are, you're probably doing something borderline illegal or not FDC compliant. Um, I mean, just I've like said on this channel like, "Yeah, we've done 70 million through one VSSL." No, no, but like but but so like but but you did 70 million over a certain number of years for sure that I think it's like there's like a VSSL will have like a limited scale potential because you're always hammering the crap out of that top 3% of the buyer pyramid which will replenish. It doesn't just like go away. It's always being refed. until you Oh, that's fun. So, like you're saying if you like hammer it like if you hammer it like if the market is replenishing I got it. That's interesting. So, like you can ride it but like once you get to if you push it too hard too fast then you'll usually break it like really that's why you're like well we went to like 50k day and spinning the whole thing broke and we went back to 25 then all of a sudden it starts working again and it's because like it doesn't have to like force itself out of like the pool of the [ __ ] that's working and then like that's why the low ticket works so well. That's why organic cont devil's advocate. Sure. Do you think there's a message that could work on a larger pool? Yeah. I mean maybe. Yeah. Okay. But it has to be transition from unaware to that that's that was kind of Blake that was his answer before this about low ticket about where it is in the like awareness. It can only get to 150. Let me say it this way. just extensive being over being over reliant on one acquisition funnel style is it's very dangerous. You need to have the value. You have to have the [ __ ] You got to get the value vortex, boys. Okay, we got it now. Thank you. You have to have like another There's another There's another throw in. So, like generating leads is valuable. Like I used to be like hardcore DR and I thought that like branding and stuff like that or like engagement campaigns and content didn't matter as much. But like brand awareness campaigns are inherently valuable if you run them long enough. People don't run them long enough. Lead gen campaigns are valuable if you're running a callunnel because then those leads will end up finding their way to your conversion campaigns. Low ticket is valuable because it keeps feeding people into your buyer pyramid that will then buy from you later. I don't know man. That sounds pretty scalable. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now, now it's scalable. It's caps. What else? What's What are you doing that's not scalable? Um uh obviously Oh, right now our webinars when we were testing them live, you can't just keep doing them live. So now we're just moving them to automated. And so I guess our plan to replace it because one of the issues is time zone. So you pick a terrible time for your webinars, you're freaked. Like no one's going to show up. It's over. And so what we found working with other webinars, what we're going to start doing is when someone signs up, it'll just stream at 700 p.m. in their time zone, no matter where they are in the world. So it's always 7:00 p.m. at night. It's like the And if it's Thursday, pages auto change all the time. And then if they miss that, then you send them to an encore like classic, but then it's at 2 p.m. the next day. So the way we're going to replace it is we're going to start doing that. Um, and then maybe we'll put a low ticket in front of it. But I'm I'm lowkey so bullish on webinars and live events right now. I've heard like six people say I'm I'm a low ticket person that not even about how like I love low ticket. I told you we should do it. I know you the challenge idea. That's the workshop one. You should do a challenge. Yeah, challenge workshop. Low tickets are great. It's basically the same I'm pushing. I know, right? Well, that's what Yeah, cuz Sorry, I didn't mean to cut off, but yeah, but you can like you can live I know somebody running with one person on a team though. It's one guru, one guy, and you live simulate it on Zoom after you do it once. Russell Brunson is selling online one. I Why is everyone saying that it takes like seven people 24 hours a day for like live like a guest, but when you live simulating Zoom? You're doing it high production style. It's like everyone on all the time for days. It takes a lot. But do you need to do live? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. We've never run one. No, but even like your first one, just having a basic ass page where you they and ideally it's paid because like if it's free, the show rates sometimes like as low, right? He's like, I will not I will no longer run free. Unless you but it comes No. Yes and no. Yes. So the biggest offers are free webinars out there. It comes down to economics. If you have if you're going at volume play, cost per lead is going to be lower for challenge sign up. You're going to have a VIP option. Y if you can get people to purchase the VIP through emails, obviously Otto page and you do that post option on the front. You have two options on the front. No, it's no opt but then heavily pushed in the group with bonuses and so it just comes down to economics at the end of the day because we've ran a ton of challenges over the past year that that have done you know I'll I won't say it millions 10 millions billions couple hundredk per challenge for sure um and whether it's free or paid the the it just it comes down to the economics of like are you going to get a cheap enough lead on the front and to hit the volume target that you need to hit the cash target that you need on the back end. Yeah. Cuz the paid acquisition of a of a buyer lead, sure, it's going to show better. It's going to close better, but typically you're going to have less volume. You played the volume thing forever. Maybe you do. We've played the volume. How do you guys make volume work if you're not sending emails like crazy? Like because I've heard that I've heard like all these people say that they do it's it's a volume game. It's volume game. on the thank you. Well, I mean, seriously, we have a we have a we have a copywriter that does two emails a day every single day as blasts in addition to the automations they'll get that are like specific and contextual for whatever they did, right? And like that's volume and we have insane amounts of content that then goes on site that if they want to make their way to there and like or and all the stuff consume, but like these other guys are like we do volume. They don't have any of that or very limited to that to IC and they still get it to work. It's like we have to have those touch points. But but are you forcing them into like a a challenge event or like a workshop event or is it long-term evergreen? It's kind of like that's what it's just like a long it's a different Yeah, it's different model. When we just sign up for a free event, I put them in like a a WhatsApp group or you put them on so we can just it's forced attention, right? Like like a lot of the uh like lead magnet funnels and trip wires and stuff, I'll see like a 60 60 to 67 day ascension to a book call on those. Wow. which is rough, but the the cost per lead is so cheap. And so again, like it comes back to what you were saying, which is like if your VSSL is capped on a direct market of 3%, you need top ofunnel leads, can you afford within the overall budget that you're pushing per month to have like a certain percent that's that is just lead magnet leads that are coming in within a certain period of time or going to the center of a call. That would be crazy. I can't imagine how long that would be for us. I think almost everything is scalable. Well, yeah. I mean, you could put a machine. It's like I was thinking like events or this or that. Like that would suck, but like people No, I think I think like people look at like like a finite thing and then they're like, "Oh, this isn't scalable." But then there's all like everyone's making everything work and then there's always just a ton of [ __ ] around whatever the single thing is. But some of those brands also have like a two out of five Trust Pilot rating. So, but they're also scaled. But they're also scaled. doing things can't scale. You have to choose what what what you're willing to pay for like what what the cost is because well no I would say there's also examples of people doing pretty much the same thing with with good trust pilots. True. Yeah. So it's I think it's zooming out more and then thinking of the value vortex and how everything's inter in interangled. But like even those even people that are running like for example VSSL's at like a heavy clip, they don't just have one. Correct. They have multiple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like that's that's still VSSLs. So it's like VSSL. I didn't say that I didn't say that VSSL's everything is scalable. I did not say that VSSLs are not scalable. I said being over reliant on one VSSL or one acquisition. It's always more than just one thing. I was hold on. I have some non-scalable things. I have two non-scalable things. this conversation. Ads that don't have ROI. This is the most non-scalable conversation will not have ever cut. Ads that don't have ROI can't scale that. True. This is why he's legit. This is why he has death and tax uh you can't scale a dirty pixel. If you have [ __ ] up pixel data and you scale into that, that's going to [ __ ] you up. That's fair. That's fair. What do we got next? What do we got next? on some like fun or more fun questions. All right, we can do quick ones. Quick ones. Yeah, quick ones. These aren't fun. These are just quick stories. What is the boldest move you're seriously? Yeah, right. Yeah, tell us your scariest story. What is the boldest move you're seriously considering in 12 months? Within the next 12 months? Like the biggest biggest like out of like what is something crazy you're trying to accomplish in the next 12 months? It can be personal or professional. I we're trying to [ __ ] get to like 8 to 10 million a month and I'm putting my absolute [ __ ] dick on the table and if it doesn't work, you know, it's like that's very stressful because the thing's way bigger and you got big payroll. You said you said we're scaling to 8 to 10 million a month. Oh yeah, we're just going off. We have like a more than a like we have a million dollar a month payroll and Yeah. You need to tell us like you got it's harder to roll up the bigger it gets. It's harder to keep leaning in the more team. What do you tell yourself when you're facing okay you want to do that next? What do you tell yourself every day as you keep going? There's got to be a conversation in your head that gets you that big I have a fundamental belief that I can do it because somebody else is doing it. Yeah. And uh that's the main thing. And then number two is that's just my appetite. I wouldn't be satisfied with something standing still. I like to continue to evolve and grow and expand. With your appetite, what does that get you? Figure out what I can do. Figure out why. I mean, I know the general trajectory of where I want to go in business and it's big. So, got to do it. Yeah. Well, Luke just said they're on the because somebody else has done it. I've said that like 50 times on here. I'm like, if I I am not the most creative person in the world. I'm not the zero to one person, but like if there's literally a framework, I talk about buying the courses or whatever, but if like I see somebody that's literally running this exact model to pick a different market and whatever, but like they're running the model and they're doing 10 million a month and it's like dumb down. It's like they're running a direct toart offer that then has a setter team that goes to closers. The price ranges are around this and it's like now it's volume and like that is the extreme dumb down version, but like the model can push to 10 million to 15 million a month. And then like what they're talking about the event and I talked about this in the video here yesterday was like and then you add these things for low ticket ascension once you get to these rates and you add recurring on the back end for at these rates and then this push like if someone's doing it at that scale at 150 200 plus there's people in fitness space doing 300 million just like loads with that whole machine but you all you see is this and it's like okay like someone can do it so why couldn't we but going beyond that is extremely difficult for my brain being like what is the unknown I talked to Adam on here and he was like I told I basically said that yeah we're trying to push this thing into like people do it at 10 million so we can do it and he was like what would you have to do to get 50 million a month and I was like I don't know and it's like the I think it's Cardone or uh Dan Sullivan's one or I think it's one of those two but they talk about it's like the 10x thing it's like if you're doing your annual planning it's like how are we going to grow 30% or 50% this year you have like 40 things you could do 2x is better than 10x yeah that's one easier yeah 10x is easier than 2x and he's like okay if you're going to What if you're going to do now instead of growing double or whatever 50%. You're going to grow 10 times. It's like what can you do? And you're just like scratch scratch scratch scratch and there's like two here or maybe none of them. And there's one thing two things that you can do fundamentally shift to get to that. And it's like that's re that's about as far as my brain can go on that kind of stuff before it's like I'm going to create Apple or you know what I mean? Like I can't I don't go there in my in my forecasting abilities. I feel like the bullest thing that I have to do is step out of operating like I think I found out where I best role in my business like business and let go. What are you hiring for? He's hiring for like I'm just gonna I mean Craig Craig and I'm probably gonna bring stuff partner with Craig. People like Craig who have things you can operate and scale because I try to like fit into doing it and it'll just like burn and so I have to let go of okay hand it off and then just do a bunch of that because I can get the deals and get the connections but it's scary to like let go of that because you start so young you control everything. The idea letting it even if you start old you control everything though. That's a limited belief. Josh Yeah, Josh answering the scale question. And it's it's him right now. Yeah. I can't scale. It's like there's all these I I have all these offer ideas. It's like realistically I can't do it by myself. So yeah. So what stops you from building a team then? Me? Um I'm not a manager. I'm an entrepreneur. So it's I can't manage. I sure I can build a manager, but why not just find someone who already is or can operate or who can do that? I want Ryan's in my team, you know? Like I want the Blakes. I'm you know I want to be this dude. You I can get this dude like where you get to five wherever. But it's like game pasta. you had to get a Ryan, you had to get a freaking Blake. So now it's Neil's people. That's why all my friends are operators. I only surround myself with operators, not entrepreneurs because I need to see like what makes a good operator, who's good, feel it out, develop that relationship and then I can and then also operators, they share stuff and as entrepreneur helps me see further and then I just can cast that vision to myself or to operators and so it's real. That's the next step. I would challenge the limiting belief though. Do it. Yeah. Do it. Yeah. But just the like one of the things that I've learned is like as a leader like your job isn't even to know how to do the thing. Your job is to design what the vision is and what the outcome looks like what does success look like? Like you can manage, you can learn to manage, but like you can manage people to outcomes. Like the way that I teach my team to lead, which I say lead versus manage, is to lead on outcomes, not on tasks. And if you hire monkeys, then they're not going to be able to figure out how to get the outcome. So it's like finding people that have in their past experiences achieved outcomes that you're looking to achieve in your company. And then literally like I do this for like departments that I don't understand. like technology I don't understand it but like I write a document for what does success look like to me in my terms from like technology it means the websites just work all the time it means like our our things connect like I don't know all the technical language but like I can break it down in layman's terms and like I give that to my senior webdev and it's like I'm like this is what success looks like whatever things you do on the back end I don't really care but this is the outcome that I'm looking for and I do the same thing with my CFO. I don't know how to do this crazy financial forecasting, but like I give, you know, it's like giving people outcomes and if they're talented, they can go get those outcomes. If they're monkeys, they're not going to get the outcomes regardless. So, it's like it doesn't framing as leading over managing does free up that like like managing managing is like you're micromanaging the tasks they do. And if you hire people that don't know what they're doing, you have to micromanage them and then you can't scale because you're just chasing them down for what tasks they're doing versus leading them based on the outcome that they should be achieving for your business. And with your what your model is copy this what yeah when what with your model there is plenty of comp and room on the table for someone like that to be like extremely motivated for quite a true a smaller portion of the pie because you have so many offers because you have so many pieces like just doing the comp plus getting the right person like bro I have studs that that are like six fig just at low six figures that work in my companies studs like talented talented talented people like you don't have to give away the farm. Not saying like partnerships are bad like you find good partnerships like just challenging more so the the thought of like because that's I feel like the man Yeah. And that's why I think financial models are so important. What I'm realizing is because financial model shows outcome like even say I hit up our media buyer and I was like here's our best case. It was like Josh Troy's like best case, base case, worst case, whatever. I sent him the sheet. I'm like, "All right, stay within this." Like, "Can what do we need to do?" Worst case is like 40% of both. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "No, these are the KPIs." And so, yeah, that's I like that lead instead of manage cuz I can lead the outcome. You can lead the outcomes. You cast your vision. The way you attract those people is you cast the vision of what you're building. And then if you cast the vision and they want to come work for you, then you like just show them what success means to you. And if they and then you lead them to that. And if they're not doing it, then it's like, okay, you're not the right fit. All right, guys. We're 40 in. We good? Anyone have any final closing fun? I don't know what he was talking about for like 10 minutes. Guess what? Yeah. 90% of the people that somehow ended up on these is that short answer. It is. So, all right. Cool. Tomorrow, I'll do the month review. Sorry for the mobile terrible audio and things.

# somebody always has a bigger boat... (8 figure months) | E49
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN4SzF3fIYo

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how somebody always has a bigger boat. I'm at a marketing conference right now in Dallas, specifically for AI and low ticket, and I'm going to be sharing some of the most interesting things I've learned in the first day, like Noace AI launches that are doing 2.5 million in a week, 4x rorowaz from low ticket before it even touches high ticket, people that are doing eight figure months in info that you've never even heard of, gazels, and boring businesses. All right, last year we did 30 million in cash collected. In total, we've done 70 million. now at 72 million uh in this business and I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, this video is going to be a bit different. I'm in the final hour here. I have been non-stop at this event, but AI low ticket. So, on day one is Anuk Singal's event, and I'm going to do my best to not divulge anything that is, you know, paid for or not specific. Um, but what Anuk basically talked about today and what the whole event about is very funny because if you go back through the videos on the channel, it's very similar and I picked up a ton of stuff that I learned today, but um, very similar to what we are modeling ours off of. So the entire model is essentially using low ticket ascension. So acquisition, liquidating a portion, the number they target is 0.5% liquidation. So you're selling something for $50, it costs you $100, you're liquidating 50, right? you're getting a 0.5 rorowaz there and then then pushing them through um different products and then on the back end though very important is having something that is recurring like a forever mastermind style thing a community something that continues to run the engine and keeping that recurring number building up until it basically covers the entire cost of the business. So for us for a long time if you see any of the other videos on the channel we did not operate in this way. Um, while we do sell a recurring high ticket thing, we don't have any back-end offers. And that's actually something we're working on right now that launches in like two days. Um, and I have this tomorrow here, but tomorrow is the first. So, I'll be doing a full month in review of April. So, tomorrow's video will be good on that. Um, so yeah, Anik talked a ton like about a bunch of stuff. Super super smart guy. They've done, you know, 40 50 million a year. They've done big numbers and I think he's done 200 or something that in total of info and coaching. So, he crushes um and obviously is involved in 92 different things. So really cool to hear and learn from him. Sales. Some of the crazy stuff I took away today was sales agencies that are in this space. I didn't really understand that they will work on like a percentage flat retainer. Like I don't like if we would have heard about this two years ago, we would have done this. The sales agencies when we had hired them uh were always operating as basically like 1099 sales managers that would get like a percentage kind of and basically like a base and percentage. These guys now run as like full agencies where they'll take 20% and they'll just full run your entire sales team. So it's like you're selling a thousand dollar unit, they're taking 20% of that. They're paying the sales reps. They're paying all like they're handling all of that CRM pieces like everything which is actually like very very attractive because if I look at our model um we should be running it less but like sometimes when how comp models are and like like how we have it structured with bonus pools and now with W2 and all these other things like 20% can happen uh on like on a certain pay period. So it's very interesting because we should be it's just like a benchmark. So, I learned a ton from these guys and like met so many connections. And the the general gist of this and this someone always has a bigger boat is like I go to talk to people and I try always to like as best I can like if to just not have the ego to not be the oh yeah we did like you know x amount of millions or this or that. There are people doing so much bigger, so much larger numbers that you've never even heard of, that I've never even heard of that like are just so quiet and do eight, you know, nine figures a year, like literally that are doing mid eight figure, like just big numbers uh that are very very quiet. And some of them are just launches in all fairness, not like full businesses. They're just offers that pump these huge numbers, but like still and their margins are big. So this is not to be like, oh, they just pump some vanity number. It's like they are taking home 25, 30, 40% of these, which is just insanity. So, I learned a lot from these sales guys and we're still on the hunt right now to hire. We have a couple that are in the pipeline. I'll go into that more in the month and review. Low ticket ascension was basically the entire target of this today. So, like two or three of the main talks were about this um that were specifically basically ways to transition them from low ticket to high ticket uh high ticket for sales, how to do it in the uh structuring of the offer. Um, I'm forgetting the name of the guy that came up there today, but he absolutely crushed it. We I used to funnel hack his stuff six years ago. He's like the number one affiliate like on all these projects. Um, Brian, I believe, and he is just like they have an agency that specifically does this. It's just like there are people that crush and have been doing this so long and have been doing this so much better and keep like a lot of the profits, which is like the big thing that I keep looking at is like when we scaled from 10 to 30, like everything broke and margin took a dive. like profit was there for sure, but not at the level it did. We didn't keep the 30% margin game when we scaled, which is a bummer. So, that's like something we're working on for this next wave of scale. And then Eddie, just special shout out. He just knows everyone. Like I've been going to dinners and after things and it's 10:45 right now and like we're just always doing something with like real heavy hitters and cool people that are just like quality people. Um, and he always puts that together. So, he was the last talk today. They have an agency, Bad Marketing, that just they do everybody and they have run everybody. Even if they don't still today, they did at one point and like he just he just crushes. So, there's a special shout out. But, uh, most interesting, this is the fun part. Noace AI 2.5 launch. I don't want to like divulge again like other people's info, but there's people there that I'm sitting across the table from that are just like spun up an offer. If my video is skipping, it's because you don't subscribed. Uh, that spun up offer and launched it completely. no community, no nothing, like an actual just course product deliverable and cranked it and did like 2.5 million cash just like bump with really aggressive margins. Let's just say I was I heard someone talking about how they did 4x rorowaz just on their low ticket at like a pretty low price, not like some like multi00 thing that then also has a similar ascension rate to what we do for high ticket, which means it's literally like there's no cost to acquire the high ticket. So it's all there's no advertising cost on the acquisition portion of a high ticket. So it's just a sales rep and then fulfillment and even on this model it was one to many. So it's low fulfillment costs on it. So it's like they're printing cash on how they're like on their uh gross margin. Software multiples I heard multiple people talk and I actually will jump down there too to exits everywhere. The software multiples that I'm hearing that people I just don't know that game very well. So like for exits is what I mean by that. So the multiples that people are expecting and have gotten and people in the space that are that they're getting. It's just something that like I don't understand and I've never built like I'm technical but not that technical in that way. So it's just crazy to see like the numbers that people are getting offered or have been taking for their software companies. Um I brief mentioned this but info 8 figure months there are people doing size like mid tens and upwards uh in info that like you literally don't even know about that are in like these weird subniches that just crush crush and like it's kind of info it's like info coaching and then some of them have like physical stuff but like it's just insanity. It's like you it's just the market is so massive and it's just such a like frame shift when I'm over here like oh yeah we did 1.6 we did 30. It's like these guys will do that in two or three months like if that or like you know earlier. So just crazy. Um gazelle. This one's funny. There's a guy that's here that's in Dubai that has a gazelle. He has a zoo in his house and I think it's hilarious and my new life goal is to have a gazelle because it's just hilarious to me. Um exits everywhere. Multiple people have been talking about exits and how they have been taking them anywhere from high six figures just kind of like just to get rid of the business and just call it a day to guys I talked to this morning that were doing five eight someone did over uh um someone did over a $10 million exit and all of them which was interesting to me were not info and coaching. Um, so it was I don't want to again I don't want to like say specific, but it was like pieces and parts of their marketing companies a lot of them. So like an agency style stuff where it was service work where they had contracts and they had things like that. Uh, which was very interesting. You don't really hear about a lot of info coaching and when even when you do it's there's a couple that have sold that are like notable that people know about and even if you dig behind those some of the conversations today are about how it's not really around the info and coaching portion. it's around like a recurring part that exists in the business or it's around some like IP specific part or it's about some like data play almost never is it actually the coaching and info portion which is very interesting. So it's like as we begin and continue to build this it's like where are we optimizing for when we're doing that? Um obviously like I've dug into this in other videos but it's like you need to remove founder risk. You need to make sure that there is a lot like you have to really decrease the risk and really make sure that's like automated in a machine. And for us, we're doing that in terms of like the founder risk in terms of like too much focus or or places we're stuck when it comes to fulfillment as well as marketing. Um and then making sure everything's structurally sound and obviously in terms of like accounting fin like operations in that in that way everyone's W2 like checking the boxes that but interesting to hear that almost everyone is not selling the info and coaching part which we've kind of like known forever but optimizing for MR both in physical and community based optimizing for high ticket and low ticket MR so there's different pockets of like where your percentage of your revenue comes from and then optimizing for multiple uh acquisition sources both in like literal traffic sources as well as methods. So like different load tickets, different VSSL, different angles, different brand faces so that there's a hedge there uh is going to continue and continue to be more important to make sure that it is a an exitable sexy business in that way. And then boring businesses tax right onto that. So many people are talking about how these skills in this industry, if you apply it even like 10% of them to a business that's like people call them boring businesses, but um home services, landscape, snow, roofing, flooring, um cleaning, like these different businesses, the ability to then be able to sell them um because they're already those are those are companies that people already buy. Those people those are companies that roll up. Those are companies that have like consistency and structure around them and have like real real to them versus just like an online business. But when you layer on the online portion, you can move quick. And when you layer on other skills in terms of like leadership and operations and uh hiring and things that you can do with like a digital flare to them, it's pretty crazy. So, sorry for the brain dump of the video today. Tomorrow's will be good. I will be getting up early and going through month and review because I'll have all my numbers and pulled everything together. Um, but then yeah, so general update, we are hiring for the sales manager. That's the current bottleneck. Days are up and down, left and right. Today's like 80 something. Yesterday was like 50 something, I think. Let me check for you real quick. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yesterday was 50. Today is 60 on pace right now. So just down, but all the volume is still there. So it's literally closes. It's like we have people at a conference, so like they're not closing. We have this that we have that. It's like it's just not good. So, it's all around the closing portion of it right now. Sets are crushing um or the sets like the actual volume of them, but they're not backing out and then you can't feel the marketing. So, we're just sitting in this loop and then we are launching the the backend stuff. So, we're coming up with naming conventions. But, I'll talk a lot more about this in tomorrow's video. So, sorry for the rough one. Daily update doc is here um where you can find all the videos categorized all of that as well as the main idea and the date they were posted. I believe today is day 48 or 49 and it was a one. So I am sorry but got to do what we got to do and it's 10:53 which I'm pretty sure is 11:53 in Eastern. So I'm making it with 7 minutes in spare for the day. So appreciate you guys. Sorry for not being active on things and providing the value. I wish I could provide more but my brain is fried. So talk soon.

# the setter strategy that DOUBLED our output... (full setup) | E48
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7Ee_QDhCI

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we're using setters to double our sales. I'm going to walk you through the different sources we are using and show you where they are visually on a funnel map and then talk about the different categories of how we are marking them in the CRM from the different sources and what their outcomes are for show and live call close. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. 70 million in that business in total. That 30 mil was last year. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on the channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of cool people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Now, apologies, I'm on mobile and I'm in Texas in a hotel room. If the loom glitches out, I'm sorry. So, sources to start, we have app no book. I'm going to break these down and show you, but app no book financially qualified booking confirms DQed, so disqualified booking confirms, low ticket op, low ticket buy, no auto, low ticket auto call, no show cancel, Mandy fall off, and custom time requests. Now, let's walk through these. So, app no book, what that basically means is actually twofold. So, app no book is basically meaning that somebody applies but does not book. Okay, so they all of these go into a Slack channel that are named setter whatever and then they are hitting these channels. So we have like different pods within the setters. And for quick reference point, we did 70ish of this with no setters. We've only had setters for a month now and we have like a sicko setter manager that came on the team that is crushing this for us and it is like an absolute production department. Like they are hitting crazy numbers for us. It was hundreds of sets last week. Like we had one day we were like 42 sets which is crazy for us because we were booking 150 calls all through marketing with zero setters at all. only closers, only volume, which we learned. We probably left like I don't even know 30, 50, some crazy number on the table. So, right here, you're gonna have app, no books. Now, these are people who applied but didn't book, and that is the first time we get the phone number. So, we do have this Mandy portion here, which is like a Mandy fall off. And what that means is that an AI is going an AI bot is going to text them if they apply, but don't book within 5 minutes. Okay. Now, this happens 24/7. So, we're basically trying to get them to call. As soon as someone calls or contacts them, the AI turns off. But if they're not online, we have like 14 of them now already. So they have pretty much good coverage. But if they're not over the weekend, stuff like that, it auto texts. Now that the what the AI could not do was handle the voice portion because it's still like we've tested a bunch of them. It's just not good enough. So now that they're dialing, it has like a massive uptick. Now the Mandy falloff portion is basically saying that when the AI gets alerted that there's something where the person needs like human interaction, it fires into a channel and then they do it. Okay, that's that one. This is the FQ and the DQ. So FQ is right here inside the process. So VSSL funnel across here, direct application funnel here, low ticket funnel here. Now when someone applies but then doesn't book, we hit them. When someone books and then is sitting here, we're now just rolled out a call confirmation team. Okay, so these people, we've had this for a really long time through a call center. It was like 20 hours a day, seven days a week. Uh they would dial, but they had a dialect and they had like a script where we kind of try to keep them clean. So because they didn't know too much about the company and it was just difficult. So we just now replaced them a week ago on both the DQ and the main Q uh or the main financial qualified with the actual setting team to do this. Now I'm going to get to the stats on these on confirmed sets of what these are. Um but it is like night and day in comparison to what we had when we were using that team and that team was already like 70% higher than when we didn't have any confirmations. But this is working very very well. Now, next portion, everything is in this low t low ticket bucket. So, in here, low ticket, somebody uh basically begins the process to check out. So, it's a two-step. So, they'll put in their name and email, and they'll go to here. Now, this one's a little more difficult because it's all via email because we don't have the phone number. So, we're talking about adding the phone number, but we don't want to break the stats. If the loom is glitching, I'm sorry. I'm on mobile and it's not great. So, um this one is all email, but we're talking about adding a phone number for here, but this is a big one. So when we we're optimizing the funnel in the low ticket for ascension. So someone's going to come in here and they're going to book here with a setter directly. If they do not, which is like 40% of them, so we already have like a 60% take 60 to 70% take rate, which is great. But for those 40% that do not, we then are setting it up a channel to live call them to try and get them on the phone or more so just do the live set there and then push them over here to a sales call. Okay. So all of these are pushing to a sales call, a set with a closer. And then the other ones is a completely dedicated team that we're calling like auto sets or imp calls or whatever you want to call them. Um, and this is where someone buys low ticket and they book in a call directly with a setter. Those are 15-minute Zoom calls. They do the call and then they get set with a closer if they're qualified. And those have insane stats. Okay. Now, the ones that I did not cover that are not easy to map out on here are going to be no shows and cancels. So, anything that falls off of this where they book, but then they uh no show or cancel even after they're confirmed or whatever, those also fire into a channel based on the HubSpot uh outcome of the deal or the deal stage more so and they're fired into there. So, that's kind of the gist of these no-shows, cancels. Went through all of these on the low ticket and the uh main VSSL funnel. Now, custom time request. This one I I'm trying to remember who stole it from, but on the booking page under the booking widget, you're going to have text that's going to say no times available that work for you. And it's going to be a link. And that link is going to either take them to another booking widget, which some people do, but I don't like that really that much because it the reason they didn't book in the first one is because they didn't find a time within the 48 hours, which is what we optimize for on the booking widget because that is the highest show rate that is just statistically shown. It's like, you know, 48 or 72 for some people. Some go out further. it feels like a crazy good product and offer and you're not doing as much volume like you can go out further because someone wants it so bad they're willing to book out and show later but for us with the volume we're doing it's always been 48 hours um as the booking window. So the link under there instead of being another calendar widget which we're talking about doing as a setter calendar widget but right now it's a form that they'll just say it'll basically just ask them when an exact time works for them and that as soon as that form is submitted it'll fire off to the setters. the setters try and reach them by phone or by text to make sure that this is a good time for them. Try and connect with them as early as possible and then set them with a closer. Okay, so these are big. Um you'll get I mean on our volume we'll get 10 of these a day depending on people who can't find a time or that time is either not available or it's further than the 48 hours. So they hit these and they get some good on that. Now how we are categorizing these in the CRM. So, inside the deal level, you are going to have the SDR owner or setter, whatever owner as a contact uh I'm sorry, as a uh as an owner property. So, you're going to have the contact owner or the deal owner in there as the sales rep. And then you're going to have another one that's going to be the SCR owner. Inside the STR owner, they're going to mark themselves only when they have claimed that person. Okay? So, important they mark themselves that. And then right under that, they're going to have a set source. This is going to allow you to be able to track depending on the source that they came from what the outcomes were. So you can pull reports, you can do all that kind of stuff on like if they came from this, this or this, what were the different ones? And that's what I'm about to show you. So for us, an auto set we are categorizing as these. So we auto set them a booking for 15 minutes and then they did a set. Now stats on that for auto booked to set is a 76% show rate and it was already over 76. Uh, and this is actually like a longer stretch of data when they were training, too. So, it's it's actually higher. Um, but 76 and an over a 20% live call close. Now, before everyone torches me for our live call close and all that, it is obviously something we are working on. If you've seen any of the other videos, I'm actively hiring a sales manager and we are like overhauling that whole team. I keep hearing that like 30% is the standard, but we had 25 20 25 as live call close the entire time we were doing like $3 million months, which just means it could have been four or five million, which is just crazy. We're stupid. I get it. We're here now. So 76% and 20%. Now self-set. We're going to define self-set as basically any of these that they're digging the CRM and finding these deals themselves to dial. So any of your app no books, any of your app no buys, any anything that is not auto set is basically only these auto calls. Selfs set is anything else, the custom time request, the whatever those dig CRM and set 61%. So obviously not as good. Now, what is also skewing this data right now is we're running DTA and testing it and this has a much much lower show rate. So, if we were just running our main VSSL funnel and our main low ticket funnel, we know the stats on that well enough. This is like brand new to be running. So, and having setters that are also ramping. So, this is kind of just like not fair data, but it is what it is. This is real. So for us right now we have 61% of them are showing and 12% live call close which still is like okay you know I mean it makes money but it's not like way in the green. So 61 and 12% on these breaks that out to what's the quick math on that 7% sales for booking. Can't do math live but that's okay. Confirm sets. Now, these ones are going to be your booking confirmation and your DQ booking confirmation, and they are going to be a 69 and a 14%. So, these stats right here, we've run triage is what we called them, the call center for a long time. And they were at peak 70ish%. And but their live call wasn't as good. And this is within four days of data or five days of data, I think, because we started on Thursday. Today's Tuesday. So, yeah, that's how we break them out. That's how we do it. And then if one is not uh set and then here's some ninja sauce for you. So the it's very common in the high ticket or like callfunnel space for if you don't confirm a call you mark it as free on the calendar which we've also never done which apparently is stupid but that's us. Um you mark it as free so that it can get double booked and then it makes it so the calendars can be tighter because the people who aren't confirming you're not like canceling their bookings for them because you paid for that marketing lead and all that but instead you're making this spot available so it can get double booked. If two people both show, the setter takes the one that didn't confirm, the closer takes that one, and then they handle it. Um, but with that being said, the we put in the CRM a mark as free and you can toggle it and it'll do all the API stuff on the background and like and push it in. So, it'll find the deal, it'll find it will take the deal, it'll find the contact, it'll run the contact, it'll find the deal uh I'm sorry, the event on the Google calendar and it'll mark it as free through that because it'll know who it's booked with. It'll know the customer, it'll know the sales rep from that section, be able to find that uh calendar event inside the admin of all the of our Google calendars and it'll be able to mark it as free. Why that's also nice is once something is marked as free, you know that it is not confirmed. So you can run your reports in inverse and being and you can say how many of these that were not confirmed, which is marked as free and don't have any of these categories set, what was their outcome? Did 10% show up or did 80% show up? Like we we don't know. I mean you're going to assume it's going to be low. So you have auto set, self set, confirm set, and non-confirmed all by owner. So then you can run it by person across each one of these and then have different commission rates for different things that are either more difficult or less difficult. Okay, combine them all. Someone gets a good commission depending on what bucket and how well they're doing in their role. Okay, little bit of sauce. We've never used them. I don't know why we didn't use them. We tried to use him and then we had our SDR manager working at another gig that he was exiting from and we paid him like a lump sum to bridge his income threshold because he was making call it 20 grand over here and he was going to start at 10 plus percentage or something let's just say and so we paid him like the bridge amount so he would make the amount on the way out and then like two or three months in after all this stuff we found out he never quit the other one and we just got railed so that's why we didn't do SCRs it's just we had a bad taste in our mouth but that was our bad so now we're Daily update. Made this doc www. needed that part. Ryan clog at/docck. I have all the videos I've made. Today's day 48. I'm sorry that this is rushed and cornered and whatever. I'm sitting wish I could show you my desk setup right now. Find it on X, but I have a magazine under the table and it's all shaking and whatever, but we're here and we're doing it. All right. We're at a marketing event and meeting some of the people for the first time in person that we've only ever digitally worked with or talked to. So, company update. Yesterday we did, let me look real quick so I don't lie for it. Yesterday was I believe not a good day. What was yesterday? Yesterday was Monday. Yesterday we did 81,000 uh which again in the right direction but like today is down not good. So we are have a very much so with the same lead volume and the same call volume. We very much so have a sales problem. Um so we have multiple sales managers we have now interviewed and I have another hundred in my DMs. Um, which is great. Like, it worked fantastic. I wanted to make these videos in order to be able to acquire talent and it worked. So, I got top dogs that I'm talking to that are specific to the industry, specific to the space, all the things. Um, and we have a good company that they want to work at that they've heard of before, which is really, really cool to hear and have like built together. So, we're excited. Um, but it's definitely the next domino to fall because as soon as we can increase these right here, these live calls, show rates are solid, right? But these live calls, when we get that up, it's game over. Um, well, it's just not game over. It's the beginning. But it'll be, you know, double the rate. If everyone's saying that 30% live call is the base, we're doing 14 right there is roughly double the units, right? Depending on how you want to look at it. Um, double the units, roughly double the cash. Um, and that'll put us in a really good place because then we'll be steady state over record months steadily. um with that piece in place and then everything will get marketing feedback because marketing can't scale right now without knowing the dollars that are coming back in the machine and we think that they're ineffectively coming back in as feedback. So we don't have signals. We can't scale into pockets because we don't know what they are because we only have half the units that we should be having coming through on qualified leads. So that's where we're at. Appreciate you guys as always. You've been giving me so much good learning things and support and all that in um the DMs uh on Instagram and on X. So, keep that up. I appreciate it. And I will talk soon. Comment on this one. Like on this one if you liked it. Sorry if I was late. Sorry if I am scattered.

# how to 10x your LTV to CAC... (full math breakdown) | E47
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrRe7PG25mM

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing the profit math behind three different funnels. And by the end of this video, you're going to understand which one of these funnels to implement in your business to make the most amount of profit. I'm going to start by walking through each one of these funnels and how they work. And then we're going to deep dive into the math on what it's going to cost you to acquire a customer through each one of the funnels. And then if you stick around to the end, we're going to talk about how you can two, five, even 10x the profit through these funnels. All right. Now, last year we did 30 million in cash collected through our info coaching business. We've done 71 now actually 72 million in total cash collected in this business. And I'm not selling you anything. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So let's get into it. So funnel number one, I'll try and be quick on these, is a VSSL opt-in funnel. This is the classic send someone to a page to claim a free training. They put in their name and email, sometimes phone number. They are then redirected over to a VSSL page, which is the training. They watch the VSSL and it pushes them to apply. They fill out an application to work with you, to join your program, to whatever, and then uh after they apply or push to book a call. Once they book a call, land on a success page that is pre-objection block framing, watch this video before your call, talk to a closer, and then become a client. Okay? And we're going to break down the math and the percents of how the funnel drops off over here after this. Okay? Now, the DTA funnel is a direct to application. Some people call it a direct to VSSL, but essentially this page is a headline, a VSSL, an application, and sometimes some testimonials. And the idea of this is they don't have to opt in. So all of the traffic makes it there. On on something like this, you may have like a 20% opt-in rate on the lead uh to uh VSSL. And here you would have 100% of the people making it to this page. Now, after someone applies, they make it through the exact same back-end part of this funnel where they book a call. After they apply, they land on a success page, same framing, all of that. Then they talk to a closer and become a client. Okay? And then this last one in red down here is a low ticket funnel. And for this we're going to use a two-step checkout. So you are going to send them to a sales page, VSSL, headline, all the copy selling the program talk or the uh low ticket item. Could be a program, could be a community, a course. Selling them on the idea of it. They put in their name and email to check out brings them to an actual checkout page. So you capture them as a lead there. Then on the checkout page, they are going to purchase the actual product. Now, this is in our case an ascension optimized funnel, not an AOV. So, instead of having uh one-time offers that would be upsells for $99, $200, whatever. Ours is just pushing them to book a call, like a starter call. And that is with a setter. So, they book into the call with a setter. Then, the setter talks to them, qualifies them, sees if they're a good fit, and then pushes them, sets them with a closer, and then the closer talks to them, and they become a client. All right? And then we're going to talk about this BE1R and BE2 in here in the profit section. All right? So hopefully that was a good gist of what's happening here. Now in an effort to make this as easy as possible while sharing both of these, we are going to talk the VSSL optin funnel first. So quick math on this. Let's say it costs you $30 to get a lead. Oops, why didn't that work? $30 to get a lead. Of those leads, we're going to say that 20% of those are going to become applications. Okay. So, one in every five is going to apply that opted in. All right. Now, from there, we're going to say 50% of them that apply book a call. And then from there, we're going to say 12% of them become clients. So, in this situation, it would cost you $2,500 to acquire a customer. Now, down here, we're going to talk into cash collected and what that means and the math behind it, but this is just the math behind the funnel. All right. Now, let's say your lead cost was $15 and everything else remained the same. Now, that might not always be true. All of these are variable. All of these could change because you could get $5 leads, but they could be the worst quality and they would not convert at the other steps in the same way. But, we're going to just use this as an example. Let's say it was a $15 lead cost. Let's say it was 30% of them applied and 50% of them booked and 12% of those bookings closed. $833 uh customer acquisition cost. Okay. Now, bring these back to where I had them in pocket. Oops. Sorry. What was I say? 20 50 12, right? So, your 2500. Now, the other thing to note when I say 12% here, people are like, "Oh, it's a 20% 12% close rate." And it's not a 12% close rate. This is from booking to client. So, this includes show rate and close rate in in one. So, industry standard, let's call it 50%. which would mean this is a 24% live call show rate or close rate. Okay, so just a blended metric that we always use that's like sal we call it sales per booking but sales per all booking. So it's like all of these all of these and that's cancels no shows reschedules and then all only all client units. Okay. Now in a DTA funnel we're going to assume it's going to cost you $7500 7500 $75 to get an application. Now how many of these applications turn into bookings? We're going to say the same amount. So, in this model right here alone, you're cutting your costs in half, right? Let's just say this is an example. Now, how many of those bookings close and turn into clients? We're going to say 5%. So, it's actually going to cost you more in this example. Now, why am I saying that? And these are all example numbers, but you know, relatively in the right direction. People absolutely nail this. And some people have this as the example. So, like when we're testing right now, this is pretty similar to what ours looks like, which is terrible. So, it's going to cost you $75 to get an uh application here instead of 150 because it is the first thing. It's directly there. It is non-gated and they can easily do it. There's very little friction. Now, once they do that, we're going to say 50% book. It might even be less on this because someone applies and if the framing is not correct, they're like, "Oh, wait. Why do I have to book a call now? Like, I just want to fill out this application and see what this was all about." So, maybe this is even lower. Now 5% and why this is the case the stats show and it makes sense why because there is less friction there is less consumption they are not further in like an actual journey with you in time sake and because it is so easy for them to apply the show rate tanks. So normally if you have a 50 or 60% show rate out of the box when testing this say it's half say it's 30% 40% that show and then once they even do show because there was not as much friction because they've not consumed as much information they are less likely to close. So the blended amount of this we're just going to say is a 5% sales per booking which makes this bloody $3,000 to acquire a customer. Now there are people that crush this absolutely crush this and with the most qualified thing ever. What you can do is add qualification. Have it just a really good VSSL. Have it super targeted. So it's like only do this if you make over 200 grand. Only do this if you do that. Like you can do that in both the VSSL, the headline and the application. You can just DQ people if they don't have enough assets, if they don't have enough uh income, if they don't have, you know, whatever. If they're not interested, like you can do so many things. So you could make this $200 application, which sounds crazy, or whatever. Actually, even higher. Let's go like 300. You could have a $300 application that comes through here, right? In this, but of this, 80% are going to book. And like guys like Jeremy Hanes are like, "Oh yeah, just put them in one. Put the booking in the app." I like the idea of having like two steps so you can capture the other people on the other side because I think you'll get more throughput. Not tested. He's probably right on this. But he puts the booking widget inside there. So it's actually 100% on his. And then once you get them on the phone, because you qualified them so hard and you pre-framed this so hard, you can continue to get your 12% roughly or even let's go even higher. Let's say it's uh 15 to 20%. And you then only have a $2,000 CPA. Also, if my video is glitching, it's because you don't subscribe. Um so $2,000 CPA on this because you qualified, right? And that's the that's the thing overarching of all of this. The economics are the economics. like it is what it is. But like if you have the right messaging, you have the right framing, you have the right qualifi qualifiers, and you have, you know, pretty solid like okay media buying, like this math works, right? So that's the gist. Now, low tickets and then we'll get into the fun part down here, which is the gross profit and the backend cash collection and the recurring and all the jazz. So what's it going to cost you to get a low ticket lead? Let's say, no, let's be real, more realistic. Let's say it's $50 to do that. Of that $50, so it's going to cost you $50 to run ads to a page and get someone to fill in their name and email to begin to check out. Now, the framing on this is very much so like you're you're buying right now. So, it comes out to 55 or to 50. 55% of those good-ish number rough could be 60, could be 40. Let's say 55. So, it cost you $91 to acquire a customer. Now, why I had this net net ad cost on here is because these are absolute. It's net ad cost is the same as ad cost. Net ad cost. This model is different because you collect cash early in the funnel. So, it did cost you $91 to get a purchase, right? That's what you got here. But you made in this example, $37. So, the net is actually, and I just uh lit this green because cash was collected. Um, it's still negative. You still lost money. Uh, but in this model, it cost you $54 net. So now you spent 91, you made 37, and now in this stage in the funnel, you're only down 54 bucks. Okay? So on this next section, we're going to say that 60% of the people book with a setter. And this is where you start to see the math get different. $152 is what it would have cost to direct if you didn't collect cash. But really, it only cost you 90 to get somebody on the phone with a setter or to technically get a setter booking. This does not include show rates and all that, but $90 is what it costs. Now, how many of those then make it over to a closer? We're going to say 50%. Kind of high, but we're just going to say it in this example. So, that's going to cost you $300 direct normal, which you're like, "Oh, wow. It's the same as these ones basically." But really, it's 180. Now, this is the crazy number. These are going to convert way higher. Way higher because not only are they a buyer, not only did they talk to a setter, but they are like the consumption levels, like the the framing that they've gotten, the touch points they've gotten is so much higher. And this is like actual stats. So for us, we're getting over 80% show rates now or right right at 80 actually. Don't want to say over at right at 80. And the close rate is also dramatically higher. So we're getting higher shows and higher closes. And because the economics are working right now, this is kind of like a throttle point that we're at because let's say this is $100, like this math breaks. So just on a CPA basis. Now you could say oh on this if you had a higher cost here or the product was instead of 37 it was 97 but then you dropped the other percentages or if you added stuff post purchase which doesn't affect front-end conversion rates but we're trying to optimize for calls so these would break these percents. So there are little things like order bumps in here just better media buying just better creative split tests on page design to get one or two% lifts. So that's one of the things working on but this math is crazy. Okay so those are the three different funnels. Now, this is just the math. And before I get into this, which is like the fun part, this is just the math, okay? And you could play with these in any which way. You could have 30% up here. You could have what we used to have, which was, you know, sub $20 leads. You could have a 55, which we've easily had. We've had like 60. And you could have this at 15. And you could be have $800 cost per purchase just on a VSSL funnel. They're warm. They're consumed. You have a ton of data because you have all these emails, you have all these things. This one you can rip off the RIP and go a little faster and get people on the phone quicker because they don't have to go through all these steps, not as much setup. And this one is, in my opinion, just harder to set up because there's just like you have to have a product that's actually good to fulfill. You have to have like there's just so many different things in here that make this work. But I do know people who test this to like test a market in a niche cuz it's like if people will buy it, then they know. I like talking to people on the phone. I think this one or this is the easiest version of launch. This one is just kind of like tried and true if you can make it work. But like I'm trying to crack this and we still haven't even cracked this. We just started it. Um this is the tried and true. We did 70 million through and this is the new new now that we have like a brand built up and like assets and all the stuff that we can sell and like a full team. The economics al make the most sense on this and it's also a volume play because you're getting hundreds of purchases of this that then may convert later and are buyers in your system. So quick math but we're going to use this one now for the portions below. All right. So, Horoszi stolen word, phrase, whatever, lifetime gross profit. So, what actually matters here and to go back to our profit math behind this, this is just what it costs to acquire a customer. Okay. Now, what happens after you acquire the customer? And this is just what it costs to acquire a customer in ads. Okay. Now, let's say, and in the model up here, I'm going to use 6,500. So, it cost you $6,500 to acquire a customer. I'm sorry. It cost you 65. You cash collected $6,500. And in this case, it cost you, we're just going to pull this one over here from the low ticket funnel. It cost you a little under $1,000. Now, a sales team, what does a sales team normally make? We're going to use these as percents. A sales team is going to make 15% when you include setters, sales management, all that. Maybe even higher. Um, like I've seen this as high as like 20%. Um, so it depends on your model, but that's a closer, that's a setter, that's setter manager, that's closer manager. Fulfillment you want to keep under 20% as well. So your cost to a coach, your cost whatever. And this is I'm going to get into these on like renewals and backends and other things, but 20% on this as well. So your gross profit of your one unit backend is $2,900. So, you paid your uh the ad bill, you paid your sales team and sales management, and you paid the fulfillment team to do the actual to like fulfill on the service. Now, that'll leave you at 44%. Where this is not good is when this number is your CPA. When it's 30, when it's 20, when it's 55, and when it's 12, and you have wait 30, 20, 55. Just do this for example. When this number is this, which has happened, let's just say, uh, and your, uh, acquisition explodes, your sales team still still makes the same amount, your fulfillment still the same cost. You're making 7.55%, which is a 0.14 multiple of lifetime gross profit, 0.14, because you are in profit making, right? Where's my math coming from? Yeah, you're making $491 in profit on this LT LTGP to CAC ratio, right? So, it cost you 64 $3,400 to make 491. Now, let's go back to where it's 998. Now, you're making 2.91x because it cost you $998 to make 2900. All right. And this math right here, just so we're clear, is the cash collected minus what it costs ad costs, sales team, and the fulfillment. Now, the low lifetime gross profit is not really lifetime in this. It's one time. So, you've been paid one time. Now, this is what happens in as you go deeper into this. Somebody, what just happened was somebody came into your funnel and we got them all the way to become a purchaser. This is them buying their first high ticket thing and they may have bought this low ticket in this example. So, they came in, bought a low ticket, offset it, and then it cost you $1,000 net in ads to get them to become a back-end high ticket purchaser. Okay? So, you made $6,500 on that, but really it cost you those ads, and then it cost you $1,300 for your sales team, $1,300 for your fulfillment. Okay? Gross profit 44%. Beautiful. And again, what this is very likely to be, let's say, is like 2500. So, you made 20% on the front end, which is not so good. Now, here's where it gets all lifetime value, and people talk about this. Now, let's say you just have this exact same thing as a renewal. Okay? So, someone stays with you for a year. Let's say this our six-month program or a year or whatever. It cost you or I'm sorry, they then repurchase the same thing. They're like, I'm on another year. They pay you another $6,500. Okay? You have no ads. you have a let's say renewal team that helps them renew where you maybe pay 5% 10% maybe let's just say 10 just so we can be aggressive but your fulfillment stays the same. Your gross profit on your renewal is a 70% margin. You make $4,500 versus the first year where you made $20 or 20%. Okay? So you make 70% versus 20. You make 4500 versus 1400. Okay? because you have no ad costs and because your sales portion, which you may not even have a renewal team, they might just renew and you make even more money. Okay, that is the beauty of this whole lifetime value reselling to customers, keeping them longer, is because now you just took what was a 0.5 and instead now on your $2,500 ad cost initially, you are now making a 2.6 multiple on that number. Okay? And then if we bring this back to where it actually was in this model, I believe that was the negative. I think I have to negative my negative. You went from 2.9 to 8. Okay. See what I'm getting at here on the profit math. So, how you acquire them is how you set the baseline for what it costs to. Like, you want this as low as possible. If it's going to cost you 3,400, it's going to cost you 2K, and it's going to cost you a,000, opt for the,000. But understand that sometimes you need to run multiple of these to kind of like have them feed each other. But on the beginning you made 2.9 and after just one renewal and this and like people do this in six month or threemonth increments. Like I've literally seen people be like, "Oh yeah, our first program is a 90-day thing. It's 6,500 bucks. You get you in blah blah blah." They get you in, they still make money. Some people even go in the negative here to do this and then they renew them after those 90 days or 6 months and they're like, "Okay, cool. So now like the next 6 months or 9 months is going to be 6,500 bucks." They pay a full fulfillment team that's under 20%. So even lower than this maybe and they have no retention team and they have no ad cost because they already paid the ad cost, right? And the fulfillment then uh I'm sorry then the gross profit on that with that is then 5,000. So they make 80% margin on that. Okay, now this is where it gets different. This is basically saying, okay, cool. They're just renewing. Now let's say you have a completely back-end offer, too. And this is kind of something we're building right now on this. Let's say it's a $3,600 product or a what's the half of that? Oops. Let's say it's 3250. That's half, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's half. Let's say it's 3250, but your service offering is different. So again, we're going to say 10% renewal team, but your fulfillment on this instead of 20% because it's a onetoone service or something like that where it costs that much to fill, it's like 3%. So think about you keep them give them access to stay in the community. They get your app. They get some software. They get something right that cost you like nothing. Your margin on the back end then goes to 87% on this but at a lower dollar value. But your cost in time and money to fulfill is so much lighter that you could have 900 people in here without any operational like overhead or like time spent. And then so this example is someone comes in, they buy low ticket cost $998 and then I'm sorry right here then net to then get them in a backend purchase of $6,500 acquired you made $2,900 contribution to overhead. This is not profit profit because you have ops teams and HR and other stuff that like marketing team that you have to pay like all these things. This is gross profit not profit bottom line bottom line profit. Okay. So 2,900 here. Then they decide to sign on for the next extension of like basically the same program, but like the continuation of that. So it's still going to cost you 20% in fulfillment, but you already paid your ads and you don't have a retention team. Let's say you do have a retention team because it's kind of likely you're going to have a retention team. Okay? You then made $4,500. So these two combined, the gross profit you made on the first one and the gross profit you made on the second one, in comparison to the ad spend that was only onetime ad spend, you're now at 7.4x. Okay. Now, they then want to stay after this first year or second year, but they're like, I don't really need uh onetoone attention or this like crazy thing, but like I want to stay for the community. I want to stay in the group. I want to stay whatever. You keep them at a lower rate that costs you basically nothing to keep them in there. It's essentially just access or using tools that you already pay for. Uh maybe, you know, a one to many situation with a coach, something in that way. Very little fulfillment. You pay renewal team, but you might not. You make 2,800 bucks on that, which in addition to these comes out to 10 G's on that same 1,000. So your lifetime value, lifetime gross profit to advertising cost or two customer acquisition cost is now over 10. So that is how you get to 10x on your acquisition cost both by understanding your acquisition methods and how to get that CPA down and then how to drive the gross profit and actually understand it. So I hope that was helpful. um felt like I went in circles a little bit, but I hope it was very helpful for you to change some things in your business. And uh yeah, hit me on X or Instagram. Um I'm making all these videos just to try and find some talent, some opportunities to network with some cool people. So if you're cool people, let's network. And quick thing, daily update. I've made videos like this for 47 days in a row. Uh and I put them here on this URL with different categories breakdown when I posted them. Um the main idea behind them and linked out. So yesterday in our info biz we did 60 no 35gs bad day Sunday very low booking and it was the start of a new pay period so people aren't as jazzed to sell because it's just a fresh commission thing versus trying to make the push which was a massive day on Saturday prior um or not massive but it was a massive day for the sales reps because they were all hitting bonuses because they were like getting over the edge. Not a massive day for us. So we're working. We're trying to sales manager. That's our current um crux of this is this portion right here, this closer call percentage. But I'm just going to over so I'm going to cut this here. Appreciate you guys. Hopefully this was valuable. Talk soon.

# answering EVERY video request in 24 mins | E46
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXcn1BLQYWo

In today's video, I'm going to be doing an ask me anything out of the video request box. I have a form on this page right here where you guys can ask for topic requests to be covered in videos. And I just went through it and there is some gold in here. So, I'm going to go through these everything from effectively building VSSLs with low budgets to scaling from the ground up and what I wish I knew when I started. All right, so figured I would do all of these in one video. So, I'm just going to do it straight off the rip. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. We've done 71 million. It's actually 72 million now in total cash collected. And I'm not selling you anything. I do all these videos just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. Today is Saturday the 27th, and I am just going to have fun with this. So, this is going to be a straight rip. So, let's go through it. How do you ensure your leads view your trust assets prior to sales calls to keep them the most warm? and how do you manage your sales team to be on point to handle objections and not have to sit and review calls? All right, so how do I re how do I make sure that they're reviewing these? So first off, you have to make sure you have these and you have to make sure that they're in a consumable and easy to consumable format. So for us, first things first is it's going to go on a thank you page. So the main video, the objection uh pre-objection blocks, uh testimonials, things you want them to consume and review prior to the call are going to be the first thing they land on. So on your redirect inside your booking widget, they are going to land on this page. When a setter sets them, they are going to send them this page in your emails after they book. You're going to push them back to this page. If my video is glitching, I am sorry. It's because you don't subscribe. Now, going back to that, all of that is going to exist on one page and it's going to be like the pre-call homework. You must watch this. Everything is framed as must watch this before. Okay? So, that's the trust asset portion. Um, and then making sure that those are good and easy to use and yeah, just making them just required. So, the objections prior and babysitting. So, for us, the twofold. So one is like having an actual large objection list that is already uh trained on and as well as just like provided to the team so they have it in a playbook in the CRM or somewhere where they can see the most common ones. So for us it's like a husband objection um it's like the classic financial objection it's the you know time is this the right time for me all those things and those already have multiple example responses to them. They cover them in trainings and then we also on the back end almost in a reactive way. So that's the proactive chunk the reactive ch or yeah that's the proactive way. The reactive way is we then do actual live call reviews. So both like solo and then across the team as well. So everyone can um get value from the one. So it's like a one to many approach for sales call reviews. And then also we have a software that we use, Zoom revenue accelerator, that will go through how to uh or it'll basically scorecard them and you can ask in there like based on this objection or did they um set the tone, did they take authority in the call, did they do this and it'll answer through AI and give you a scorecard that is then summoned across the whole team where you can review them and kind of like quick scorecard without having to watch an 30 to an hour long zoom. Managing sales team process to make closes just objection, no friend breakdown happening. exact same thing I just said. So, we have a scorecard on this. A lot of people in the past have had VAS that do this. There's now AI that does this. So, there is Gong. Um, there is Zoom Revenue Accelerator. You can build it custom. Um, there's a lot of out- of- thebox tools. Someone just sent me one the other day that's like cheapo, but I believe the number for Zoom revenue accelerator is like 40 or 50 bucks a month per license, which is like not bad. So, for us, we have, you know, 25 30 of them and it's like a thousand bucks a month. So, how do you effectively build a converting VSSL, a high converting VSSL with a low budget? So, I built the first one um or wrote the first one and structured the first one from a $5,000 course I had that I'm pretty sure is now for free. So, um Becker used to Alex Becker, who's like super prominent now in crypto and also um owns the Hyros ad platform. So, he used to have a course. I paid like five grand for it. It basically was a troden horse to get you into the software which worked and we love Hyros and we still use it to this day especially for like the viewer. Um, but for the actual converting VSSL, he had one in there that was like a 15-minute script, and then he had one in there that was a 25minute script that was basically, you know, set intention. Here's what you're going to get. If you stay to the end, get this bonus. Here are the four keys in order to do so. And then wrap up in CTA very simply. Um, and then how you actually structured like the design, the video of it, PowerPoint style, keynote, whatever. And it had the different ones almost ESPN style. That was the original one we built. Since then, we have copied people. Since then, we have bought other courses. Peter Kell is a really uh big guy that has frameworks that are public. He's like the VSSL god. Um Nick Verge is on there. He has really really good VSSLs and uh writes them. As well as so you can either buy courses that have them, you can find it free on YouTube of people who have done it that convert. You can funnel hack people that have them live because generally speaking, they're either testing or working and the ones you can see that have a ton of uh spend behind them are still working or they would not be spending money on them. Um, and then the other is either paying someone like a lot of time it's like 20 grand right now, 15 20 grand or you can find somebody that you pay that is doing it as a percentage basis. So the sales that come through there, they'll take 30% or 10% or whatever and you can always broker a deal. Um, so there are plenty of people out there that'll breaker uh broker that deal with you and be willing to do that. So hope that answers that one. But could you do a breakdown of how you structure payouts for your team, how you invoice clients? So these are two different things. So one is how I pay the team or how we pay the team, sorry. And then the other is how we invoice clients. So before I say any of this again, like these are all my this is my experience. This is my opinion on these things. Um I kind of feel like weird egoy douchy when I say some of this kind of stuff because it's like this this is the way and it's not always the way it's a way. There's 25 ways to get to the same results and this is just my experience with it. So I hope that is clear. So how we structure payouts for the team. So the actual software, this is actually just kind of like a side tangent, but we used to use Gusto. Um used to work really well. And then now there's like deal and rippling. They always go back and forth and they have some tea if you want to look at them. They're always beefing back and forth. But we use Ripling for that. Um 95% of our team if you come team is just like people that do work for us and uh work with us. Uh is W2 now. Um the other part is 1099 but for a long time everyone was 1099. So how we structure payouts for the team is driven by KPIs. I have an entire video on the channel of like who is paid as a performance versus a flat. My goal is to get everyone as close to performance as possible. Whether that is the company's profit share total or if it is just the deliverable within their department. A good example of this is across like our seale or leadership style um team. We have a CMO, we have a chief product, we have uh sales and we have whatever. Let's just use those three as an example. All of them make some version of a base. They then make some portion of a performance directly or majority performance that is based on their role and their KPI. But they also then all interact with each other. For example, the CMO is going to make it based on net CPA, right? So they can control a ton of that in terms of marketing costs, but because we're mainly a call funnel and it's done over the phone, that then touches sales. So the CPA could be 5K, but if they close really well, it could be 1K. So they have, you know, um they have they're in the fight the same where they're trying to help sales with quality with whatever because the higher the close rate, the lower the CPA. Now sales, same thing. They're constantly looking for bookings at whatever uh volume of bookings. So they are trying to support in that with marketing and uh help there. Product that one is tied to profit share which is directly in line with the um the cost per new client acquisition which is essentially that whole bucket. So like acquisition is marketing and sales and then fulfillment is that product and people side. They get paid as a profit share. So they need to make sure that the costs are here, the closing rates here and they have the right people and the right quality. Okay. So how do we invoice clients? This is direct billable. So we use order forms. Right now we still use Clickfunnels. We use Stripe for processing. We do have backups because everyone says we're stupid if we're just on there. But we still have just maintained that because we have good customer support and we are good to our product and have a good brand and we refund people and have a low chargeback rate if they're not happy or if we don't feel like they're a good fit for the program and they were missold or anything. So that's how we pay. I think that's what you're asking here, how we invoice and then send receipts and all that kind of stuff. Um they check out, they fill out their card information, they side in terms on the client side. So that it's all you know kosher in that way. How do you acquire info client deals? Touch point to onboarding signing deal for your bid. Hard on cold email but heavy hitting starting from zero. Um all right. So I assume what you mean by this is like how to build an info coaching business where you are not the face. So basically like you run the business, you operate it and there's an expert. So that is the style that we did. Now to be clear, I was not the one who started this one, right? So the other co-founder, two co-founders and me owners, right? Um, so one co-founder was the expert. The other co-founder was the person that approached this deal. Basically came to them came to the expert and said, "Hey, I want to build a business around you. Um, we're going to sell this. We're going to scale this. You're going to get X percent." Generally speaking, it is a minority percentage because they are acting as the face, the whatever, but all of the fuel in terms of the acquisition, the fulfillment, the building of the team, the like entire company is done by said operator or business builder versus the expert. Okay? So, how you go about that is if you have no case studies, results in anything in terms of like paid or funnels or anything. Um, generally speaking, it's a trust game. So, you're going to compile case studies that are not yours and you're going to say that. I mean, that's how I work at least. I know people who kind of like fake it till they're make it. Not my speed, but I would go through and basically find case studies. Um, us as an example, there's like a million of these, but I know some guy messaged me the other day and he did it with, you know, here's my face or my expert and it's in a yoga niche. teaches people how to start businesses in the yoga space. Um, and he came to him, built a business around him. I don't know their exacts. He was just in DMs and was nice. So, but like there's a million examples is what I'm saying. So, generally speaking, call it 7030, call it 8020. Some people go 5149 depending on how much like leverage and um how you can sell the deal. But you're going to approach them, say, "This is a thing." You're going to productize their service. You're going to build a business around them and they're going to get paid to do it. But you need to make sure you have a good relationship with them. You need to make sure ideally that this is like structured and written out well. Um cards are going to be a lot. You're going to hold hold a lot of the cards in terms of making sure things actually work and handling payouts, handling all the books, handling the team, all of that. The big thing though is like I've heard this way too many times where you get somebody up to half a million dollars a month that they're making or something crazy, right? And they just are good. They're just done. They're like, "Oh, I already gave you the ads. I already gave you the product. It's auto fulfill. whatever and then they go find a beach somewhere and your business like goes to zero. Like you need continuous ads, you need continuous uh support and that has been a blessing that we've had the co-founder expert um in our business has been like the hardest worker throughout the entire building of the business in the beginning in order to get us there. The iteration on ads, the iteration on product, just like the time like in it in it in terms of like a real business partner, not just like some influencer that's a face. So like it was just not the model we had. That's extremely important because I have heard so many times that the expert dips after they make a little bit of cash. So, making sure you're good there andor that you can diversify, you own the IP across it. Very important. You own the assets and that's clean and clear. So, signing the deal, do that. Hopefully, that was helpful. Again, ask more questions in this inbox at any time. And I'm going to do these just because none of these are like one whole video. I feel like I could do some of them a bit longer, but I just feel like this would be a good way to do it. how I helped warrior babe scale to 1 million mistakes that you can avoid. Um, so again I came in, we're definitely under a million, but I came in and the initial was helping like in-person personal training clients. Then it moved into building like an info product oven style uh where it was like a course and it was $500 like direct to cart. Then it went to a low ticket app uh was like a $27 a month 7-day free trial with $147 a uh Otto to have lifetime access. So, like he was attempting to do the lowfunnel AOV game and ascension rates and MR like LTV didn't work. Okay, there's a lot of words in one, but they all made sense in it if you replay it. Um, so how I scaled it, I didn't directly scale it. Um, I came in and they already had product market fit, which is I see another question down here. I'm ripping these off the top, so sorry if I'm yapping, but um, we basically had a call. We were doing 30 grand, 50 grand, something a month around there and like breaking even basically after everything between ad and fulfillment and stuff. And we're like, how do we take this thing to 10 million and I was like, I would love if we did a call funnel. Like, let's do a call funnel. Let's build the product. We already have it in the background. You guys already built it. You just didn't sell it directly or via the phone. So, we're like, let's do that. And that's how we got to the first million month was selling info. That same course exactly as it was before we even we revamped it after that, but around it was before then. That's how we got to a million a month was selling that course over the phone increasing the price from 497 to97 to 14.97 building the sales team having fulfillment basically like very small scale because we just needed more people to manage community and do group coaching calls but the product already existed fulfillment cost just got smaller as a percentage um as we scaled up the front end but it was a mass volume mistakes I can avoid um in that we should have this kind of just like a broad overall we should have varied the we should have focused more on the acquisition as we began to scale and began to change things because it was rising and we didn't know our numbers well enough and I was not involved enough on like the true true numbers not just marketing numbers at the time to understand kind of where the cash flow was going when we moved over to coaching which had inherently a higher cost to fulfill because we have a onetoone coach so there as that acquisition grew we should have hired the right people and hired a CMO at an earlier phase because we were doing the marketing the other co-founder was leading it and you know in it out of it in ways of like we tried agencies so we could be out of it. We tried having good internal people but not really managing them that well. And then also overarching in marketing we did not optimize for the acquisition model. We just kept running the same one. And that was a lot of me probably being like we can push it further. We can push it further. But I also wanted to launch a low ticket that we just I didn't press hard enough. I didn't build it. I didn't know how. I didn't hire the right people to do it. And we should have. So, we should have changed acquisition models to have low ticket earlier when we had all this massive free cash from what we were doing and we didn't. Um, and then yeah, I think we just scaled kind of too heavy. We did this W2 shift too early like legally it we had two different lawyers look at it on like if we should be W2 or 1099. They were both like me kind of thing like into the future and like if you want to like exit and all stuff like they should be W2 but like in current state do they need to be? No, but kind of. And we're like, "Oh, future state, future state." And we were doing these big numbers. Literally, as soon as we did that, also the acquisition stuff broke, also this. So, it just ate up what would be profits at the time and cash got tight. So, yeah, I mean, run it leaner, not higher into future state, but more so higher where it hurts. And then making sure that you always know your acquisition numbers, especially especially if your entire business is acquisition, paid acquisition led. So, yeah, I could go down this one forever. Uh, we should have leaned into organic better. We still to this day don't touch organic. We should have done setters earlier, lean version. Um we should have had more direct to cart stuff that had lower fulfillment, more ascension to build a moat. Like there's just a lot of things there. But uh technical side of paid ads attribution and making it dumb down. So the dumb down version is just get high. So Hyros does it. It's really good for call funnels because the buyer journey is longer and being able to have all the finger point fingerprint and touch points of where they were and watch the journey whether they clicked on an organic thing, they did a Google search, they saw an ad here, then they saw a retarget ad here, then they saw a Google ad. So meta meta Google and then they purchased and knowing that buyer journey. Hyros can do all of that. Then it can also fire to the pixel. Um, it's the simplest way to say it. Like, I mean, it's probably not the simplest way to say it, but the simplest way is you just throw the pixel on site, you connect Hyrosse to all of your sources. So, you have bookings, you have calls, you have Stripe, you have all those things, and it just collects all the data and then pushes that back to where the conversion came from. There is like way technical more ways and you know people say Hyros picks up 80% of it and you know, if you want the deep deep detail, you got to do it custom or with these back-end solutions and all this. The 8020 is if you just want to just get the like the best result for kind of like the least amount of effort. You just pay for high roast. It's overpriced supposedly. I don't know. I think it works and we definitely make more money from it than from what it costs. So that's what we use as one portion. And then we also do a full custom side. The nitty-gritty is you want your browser and server events to match and you want to make sure they're going back to the right sources from the right things. So, if an event happened like an application, a booking, uh, or a purchase from Facebook, you want Facebook to know that. You want to make sure that they see that the person did it on site, which is the browser, and then you're also sending them the data from your side of things, which is the server, roughly speaking. That's kind of how that works. And you want them to match so that Facebook sees that we have that data, they have that data, good to go. So, that's the gist. And then using standard events supposedly is the new thing that everyone uses native or like standard events. We use those, but we had really, really good results and did large numbers when we're using custom conversions. And I just talked to someone the other day that does complete custom conversions for people who have issues with the meta health change that occurred on the pixel. They just set up custom conversions prior to this and like sees the pixel and it works as good or better than it did prior and they have no purchase even optimization they can make. So, I don't know. But there's smarter people than me out there who do this. But that's the 8020. Um, what do I do if a sales rep is out and full calendar of book calls? This happens more time than I would like to admit. Um, a lot of times someone's power will go out. They are don't have internet for whatever reason. They're traveling and they thought they were going to have service and they don't. So, they will notify us in the Slack and we will take a basically like screenshot more or less of here are the calls and here are the contacts of when they have them and who can pick them up and people will either have open spots, they will have no shows, they will have something. They will claim those calls and take them. They notify the person, they or they hop on the autogenerated Zoom link and they take the call for them. We remove it from the person so it doesn't count against their bookings, but it's like obvious obviously a no no, but then that person who just claims the booking gets the opportunity to have it and gets the opportunity to get the close. So I think that's what you mean by that. How to scale from the ground up and find product market fit. Not the right guy to be answering that question. I have never directly done this and it is just not in my skill set. I've never taken something truly zero to one. I like courses. I like frameworks. I like systems that work. I like finding somebody who use an industry to do 10 million a month and going, "Okay, cool. Well, I at least can get this to 10 million a month if I just follow their framework, roughly speaking." And it's again, it's like, you can look at it two ways. It's one, it's like shoot for the stars and if you land at 5 million, like good for you because you tried to execute it how they did and you followed their framework and you got there. Um the other is once you get to that, it's like a new frontier. I talked to that ad um Adam from Ringba last week and he was like, "Cool, yeah, you know people who do 10 million, but how do you get to 50?" And it's like there's a lot of different ways to look at it on that. Um, but for the 0ero to one, nothing is new. Everything is a variation of something that exists. I try and like put my mind in that frame a lot. And just a small iteration of something can be seen as 0ero to one. They started this business specific from the ground up. Everything else I've done has been generation or scaling again of something that exists. All these like affiliate lead genen style stuff. You're not really creating something from new. You're scaling something that's already an offer and exists. um random drop ship stuff like anything I've ever done has been that. But in my best attempt to answer this to how to scale from the ground up would be and really with this part finding product market fit. I'm a big believer in being able to talk to the customer and get feedback from them. So assume coming up with basically the theory that X niche of people have X problem which you can do so much research now on with Chad GPT and Reddit and like all these things. This is a problem that people are continuously having. You come up with a service that solves it. You frame I help these people do this within however you do that. Get them to watch a video that's basically going through that or a sales copy about it and then either sell them something low ticket or have them book a phone call which I think is even easier. Um where you are going to offer to help them with it. Get them on the phone and talk to the actual person to be able to get feedback on what the problem is, what really is the problem within that. Go deeper. Do a bunch of discovery and then you can adjust your messaging and offer in alignment with that. I also think that you should do that before you build an entire course on how to fix something or build an entire product on how to do something when you've never sold one of them because you may be completely wrong on what you're building and you just wasted a 100 hours building or buying or spending money or whatever to build a product and service that people do not want even though you think they want it. So starting from the front and selling it first. Managing online teams. I made a whole video on this. We're completely remoteund and something people uh Slack is like where all the communication is. channels are split up by division. So like by team slash like results. So like you'll have a sales team, you'll have a setter team, you'll have a coaching team, you'll have an operations team, and then you'll also have like offshoots like a webdev external for contractor. You'll have a marketing team specific, you'll have a paid ad specific. If you have breakouts and there's enough people, it makes sense to split things like a marketing main and then creative paid, creative organic. Those are generation and like editing for both of those. a copywriting. When you're doing a lot of copywriting in terms of email scripting, stuff like that, it makes sense to break things out, but don't go over. So, that and then a meeting cadence. We run on the same style of agendas and like project lists, to-do lists, in Q lists. Uh they are all structured the same way. So, it's uniform across. It is a top- down approach. And then we do those on a weekly cadence with some pop-up just random meetings when things need to be worked through. uh and most of the meetings are around making decisions and coming up with the projects and then the actual projects are taken offline into their own meetings to be handled versus trying to like work through an entire project when you have five or six of highly paid people in there. Um so yeah, so that's those and then dashboards and KPIs are huge. So everyone is on the same page and transparently sees the same numbers whether that's a P&L or performance specific KPIs to their department. Those are in there. A video on how you organize your team via Oh, whoops. uh project manager, Slack or whatever. I did make a video on this as well. It's like the how we manage 110 people team. Um but for one to two VAS are looking to grow. So for one to two VAS, again, I would set it up by by like topic. So for example, if I had like a lead gen one, which I've had like as a, you know, side fun thing, but like I would have a creative, I would have a media buying, I would have a copy, like I would have the different segments of what's important to that. So you have someone who's doing the actual clicking of the buttons for media buying. You have someone who's doing the creative and then likely they're working with someone who's doing like copyrightiting scripting both for the ads and for the video scripts, let's just say. And then you'd have like owners operations or whatever. Let's just those are the exact ones. If you were doing lead genen scale, you'd also have one that was buyers. You would have one that's right. It's like what are the segments of the business and who lives within them and then where is their overlap that would exist in a general or like an operational level and then put those people in the right buckets so they're focused on what they're doing but they can collaborate with the people that are important. Um, and then a project manager generally is going to overlook that whole process, especially at a small scale like this if you even need a project manager. But if you don't think in that left brain style, uh it's probably helpful andor using some sort of AI or ClickUp or ASA or something like that so everyone's on the same page with projects where they are coming up with a decision-m either you or as a crew deciding on it and then watching the status of it as it goes through the pipeline or funnel of to-do in progress needs review live and iterating on that feedback. So hope that was helpful 23 minutes in. But yeah, none of these are like I mean I guess I could package some of these into like full videos if you guys want, but feel free to pop here. www. need to do the WWS cuz I broke something. I don't care to fix it. Uh in the request, um you can ask more questions and then just drop in a quick little thing. Daily update, same thing with doc. I have all the videos. We are on day 46 today and I've done one of these every single day. Um I put them all in here, segmented them by what category, date, the actual kind of idea because the title is changing. Uh there's a kid who's like editing all the thumbnails and doing this and I have to pull him back sometimes because he goes a little too clickbaity. But that's that. Um quick daily update. Yesterday we did 63 grand, something like that. Uh we're hiring a sales manager. We need consistency around this. Same count of bookings, not the same amount of sales. Did a video yesterday on low ticket. It is like crushing it in terms of acquisition. We just need to get to volume and for that we are waiting on the CPA to be in alignment and then making sure that the setter team is on the back end. But the current chokeold is sales. So, I am hiring, hiring, hiring. It's Sunday and I have meetings at 7 PM tonight to talk about it further with some of the candidates and I have another hundred that I'm combing through and trying to pull out the best ones. So, hope that was helpful. Feel free to ask questions. Um, and yeah, hit me up on XIG, wherever. All right, talk soon you guys.

# made $632K selling a low ticket product... here's how. | E45
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRw-8q9xowY

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we made $62,960 using a low ticket ascension funnel. And by the end of this video, you're going to understand the math behind it and how to implement one of these in your high ticket business. I'm going to do a quick funnel overview and I promise you it is simpler than it looks. And then go through the metrics and math behind it for low ticket purchasers, cash calls, and the ascension rates. And then I'm going to go through the new plan that we have to scale the out of this thing and some examples of what happens when we do. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected. In total we've done 71 million in this business. And I am not selling anything. All the entire channel is is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So let's get into it. So first things first, what is a low ticket ascension funnel? Essentially, you are selling a low ticket product, $20, $7, you know, upwards of $100 with the goal of getting them to ascend to your back-end product, which is usually a high ticket, 5K, 10K, 20K product. Okay? So, the entire goal is not necessarily like AOV and breaking even where it costs you 50 bucks to get the customer and you make 50 bucks. That's like I mean that is the goal to self-liquidate fully. But really really what it is and usually what happens is you partially self-liquidate or liquidate the front end and then the net amount when ascended is cheaper than if you were to run a VSSL funnel or some of these other types. So for example, this is the one we are running right now. It is one product and it has one AOV. There are no order bumps. There are no uh Otto upsells anything. All because the goal is ascension. All right. So we tested to start three different front-end sales pages. The front-end sales page is just going to collect the name and email and push them then to a checkout page. Okay, so this one is actually like an original one that I created that's super ugly and like pretty long form. They're actually all long form, but this one's really ugly. And these are two professionally designed ones, a light version and a dark version with like a lot of the same copy. So, in the first iterations of this one was basically completely knocked out of the race. Um, and I made a video on, sorry, just looking at the sheet real quick. April 3rd talking about how we had done about 30 grand just testing this and we're still testing it, but we've done 600 now. So, um, these two are the main that are running and we're kind of constantly trying to test and beat the control with variations of this and they're very close, like kind of neck and neck in the testing, but we are getting name and email here. They're going to a checkout page where uh they actually purchase then they land on a booking page. So instead of an Otto that's, you know, they go from a $50 product to a $500 product or $199 product to try and get an increased blended AOV on that to offset your advertising cost. Instead, the goal is to get them to book in. And for us, they're booking in with a setter. They then talk to the setter, comes in as a call scheduled. They either no-show the call, cancel the call, uh turns into a follow-up that needs to happen, or they're lost, or the real thing is set. Okay. Once they're set, they go over here and they move into a closer call, into a call scheduled. And then from there, that call either no show, cancel, hot listing, long-term follow-up, close lost, or one, meaning they ascended and purchased our high-end or high ticket product in the back end. Okay. Now, math and sections behind this. So, across this range, I pulled data actually year to date. So the real like true testing window of when we have been we had it running for a bit prior but like when we really turned it on dedicated ad accounts dedicated pixels all the setup was about a month and a half agoish let's call it um so mid-March but this is year-to- date numbers because we were still selling it and there was still Ascension we've had 2,000 units sold of this specific low ticket product from that we have made $76,960 in cash collected there setter calls calls we have had oops sorry setter calls we've had 923 booked so that is what has hit this portion now the math on this what actually is happening around 60 to 70% of the people that purchase the low ticket are booking in here so I'm giving you the total numbers but we have like iterated we've like split test pages we've increased that rate from 40% or literally zero because we didn't even offer it for a portion there was no setters on the team so these numbers are a little wonk in terms of what I'm going to say for these uh percentages, but around 60 to 70% of them are booking in a call with a setter. Those setter calls that then go on to a closer call has the highest show rate and close rate of anything in the entire company through any other acquisition method. Okay, so again, sorry, looking at data over here real quick, but the show rate on those right now monthtodate is 76.7% and the live call close is like 23%. And that is with us having issues in other places not optimized, not doing this. So like the math maths uh aggressively in that versus any other acquisition model that we're using. So how many back-end purchases that turned into? 81 bought our low uh bought our high ticket cash collected on this $526,000 which is a 3.89% ascension. Now if you watch any of the other past videos, I talk about how 4% is like the target and then above that is like the real where we want to land. Now the reason it is low here but we are now leaning into it. This entire time has been a testing period more or less where we have been trying to see where it backs out and what the time from purchase from initial purchase to backend ascension is. And instead of us trying to scale this and sell 500 units of these a day, you have a massive cash trough if you're not liquidating on the front end, which we are not fully. Um you have a mass massive cash trough until you know what that percent is. So why this number is 3.89 is because I just pulled these numbers 30 seconds before I made this video. And that is including this month and today and whatever's units which don't even have time to ascend. So this average that is out here again sorry peeping data over here. The average is somewhere in 3 to 5 days that they're even booking a call. And then from when someone books a call there's generally follow-up. I mean they are they're built as one call closes here but they're technically now since this newest iteration two call closes. So you have time between this call and this call. You have follow-up between these calls and you have follow-up from the post call to the close. So there is a time trough that is unknown. And that's why we didn't want to lean in and scale into this thing. Even if the initial metrics and cost pers made looked good. Okay. So 3.89 right now. But really if I back this thing up, it's over 4%. Well over. So or or going in the direction of well over. So that's extremely good math for us. Now, what is the plan for this? And then I'll touch on these green boxes here. New plan. These have scale limits. So, both the product and the awareness level of what the product is that we're running. So, there's a bunch of guys that used to do this in internet marketing and they kind of still do, but like they would lean into like a a productivity suite for landscapers, call it a productivity suite for somebody who does uh Facebook ads, something like that, right? like that is a niche within a niche and it only has so much volume that you can do on a daily basis. And why that is kind of an issue or a limiter uh is because if only 3.8% of these people are buying your backend product, you would have to sell 100 units a day to round up sell four high ticket units on the back end. Now, if your targets are for you to be selling 20 units of high ticket on the back end, you either need other acquisition meth methods or you need to scale the out of this. And that is extremely unlikely because your CPA is going to go through the roof. The market size, just the general scale of when you start to increase spend on something like this is going to increase that net CPA. So that's an issue. So for us, we're kind of feeling that out. Uh we have a more mass market audience, which is why we should have been doing this the whole time and we're stupid. But for 71 million, we just did a high ticket of the SL call funnel. I have other videos on the channel talking about those and kind of where we did. And then the other one, a scale limiter is availability. So one of the things that is not often talked about when using right affiliates, partnerships and all this is when you use a call funnel you have a rate limiter on availability. So on any given day there are only so many setters, sales people, whatever that will have open spots and availability and that is your like throughput issue, right? Like you can't because of that be able to book into calendars. If I if I had an affiliate send a thousand new customers of this product today, it would instantly break because we only have 60 available spots for setters on a given day. So, you have to be able to like scale those linear as you go across or you drop all your percents down because if there's no availability for setters, they don't end up on setter calendars and they never make it to a closer and then they don't buy. So, your ascension drops through the floor, right? Like, you have to be able to model those off this. So, not only is am I I'm basically saying two things that are going against each other, but awareness level if you're trying to scale this up, you need something that's mass market enough where you can sell 500 units a day or 200 or whatever number to hit your backend target, which is 3% 5% whatever ascension rates. There's a really big guy in the internet marketing space that used to say that his was three at for like a long time like when at scale and that's like a good target number that a lot of people will go for. We're going for four on this just because we can, but 3%'s a good one. But if you have a target of three on the back end, that's three high ticket units for every 100. So you sell 300 units, you do nine. And the timetable in which that happens is different on every single one of these, which you need to be aware of. So affiliates and partnerships, that is on the table for our plan to do this. But in order to do that, we need to solve for this and make sure that we do it in a stairstep approach to where we have the availability on both the setter and the closer schedules in order to scale this. All right. Now, scaling limits just kind of like quick back to this. The other option with the nich the niche and awareness is having either multiple of these or having another one instead that is like the actual big one. So, think broader for your market niche. Think as like kind of broad as you can get. And if you can find something that still solves a problem but is able to sell 100 to 300 to 500 units a day, that would be more of the plan. So you wouldn't have to have nine of these. And again, there's another internet marketing example where guys had 10 12 of these all running at the same time. And it just gets kind of confusing. You need different pods of setters for different things because they're having different calls that are framed differently. What did the person buy? Um just stuff like that. So automations next step push to purchase, push to book, push to app, and push to show. So when somebody apply or opts in but does not check out, we have a sequence that pushes them to purchase. We just now like put more depth into that and like kind of redid the copy. So that'll get a small lift. We just now did when someone purchases but does not book a call with a setter. They have a push to book sequence that also includes an SMS because now we have their phone number. On this next sequence, we have a push to app, which is after they book, we try and get them to fill out an application because stats show that if someone fills out an app and puts more information in like the free form boxes and stuff like that, they have more emotional buy in and they are more likely to purchase. Push to show. Oops. That we have literally I think we just rolled this out this morning and today's the 26th. So, this data was not being tracked properly because we were doing so much of it. I didn't even know what the show rate was because we're ramping so many siders at the same time, ramping so many low tickets. I couldn't even tell you if it was a 30% show rate or an 80% show rate, but I knew that these numbers were getting to the closers and the math was working here. So, I kind of didn't care for a minute. Okay? Like, we we sacrifice the data for that. Now, now that I and I know this number, it could be better. Let's just say that. So, uh we put in place calendarly auto reminders. We put in place emails warm-up to try and push them to show for the call and give them framing on why they should show for the call. scripting on this is also changing and the setters are getting better because they are brand new. So now they have more iteration um or more experience more so and now they are able to set more from there and then we're also working on a ton of stuff. We're hiring a sales manager right now. We're like reworking we're going to rework that whole thing so we can scale aggressively. Um and I have another video where I just talked about this yesterday where I talk about the whole sales team shift and what we're doing there. Okay, split test. We are, like I said in the beginning, kind of constantly split testing these because we're just trying to break this down to where just off this alone, the net CPA is within a KPI target that we chose. So, call it 60 bucks, call it 100 bucks, whatever number it is 20% above that right now. And the goal is to make it it's 20% above that interchangeably. Like sometimes we're in KPI, sometimes we're not, which means we need the sometimes not days to be 20% under so that these the bad days are within KPI as well on average. So, we're working on that here. But what we can also do with those optimizations is AOV boosters. So, those are currently in the pipeline. Those are actual products and we are uh extremely careful and really make sure that our brand stays intact when we launch stuff like this. So, we need to make sure the brand quality and product quality is there. I like to say that as a big differentiator of what we do and why we have kind of a bigger moat is because we have proper expert, we have proper coaches. I mean, we have however many thousands of reviews now. Um, it's important to us that the product quality is there. So, we're not just going to slap on something and sell it just to increase AOV if that is then not going to carry through and have continuity to our back-end products and our actual brand of the company. So, AOV boosters, someone buys, you know, what did I use earlier? Calendar example or productivity example. Next one is a workbook or calendar uh a morning routine book this and that. You can add those as uh order bumps to the checkout, which is statistically proven to not decrease the checkout page uh percentage or the the conversion rate on the checkout page and then still get the Otto. So, the goal being if you're selling something for 50 bucks, you have three of these on here, it can increase the blended AOV to a $65 and you get that $15 blended across the whole thing back against your ads, which makes it so you can scale harder without affecting the ascension, which is huge because a lot of people will have like upsell one, upsell two, downell like over here and all of that. We don't want that because we want to optimize for the bookings, but we still want to increase the AOV and that is the place to do it inside the checkout. So, those are currently being built because again, it's important to us to have the brand quality. And then this is a funny one I just want to talk about. I just talked to someone today that said call paid where they actually took this Otto booking and literally made it an Otto booking where the implementation call was a paid thing that was like click here if you want to purchase this booking or p purchase a call with a team and framed in this way that's you know it calls 10 bucks or 50 bucks or something. So you're actually getting paid to get them on a call with a setter and that increases show rates. I mean you get 100% show rate on that. It increases AOV, but it likely decreases the volume. And I don't know if we're really in the business of wanting to do a paid version and then if they say no, basically giving it to them for free because we do want that. I don't really know where we s with that, but that was a fun idea and just thought it would be potential. So now, examples on how the math works overall on this for a high ticket business. Let's say you're $10 net and you have a 3% ascension, which is crazy. uh the $10 net part, that's a $333 net CPA for your back-end product. Now, let's say that net CPA climbs uh way higher, which is much more realistic with uh meta marketing. Let's say $50 net, $1,600 CPA, and a $75 net is $2,500 CPA. Now, anybody who runs high ticket VSSL funnels or any of those things know that depending on what you're talking about or like how qualified your niche, like you could have $400 calls, 50% show rates, and a 20% close rate. And what is that? $400 calls, 50 across. That's a $4,000 CPA versus this model has you at 25, you know, 330, which is is the unrealistic example, but like this isn't that crazy. $2,500. So, you could drop $1,500 on on your CPA for every unit using this. Now, there's a million ways to do this. There's book funnels. There are low ticket actual AOV focused ones that break even. Um, there are people that run it with this exact model. Like, I know a guy who runs this with 3x rorowaz on this front end just right here because the ticket is higher and they're great marketers. So, they'll sell something for $100. It'll cost him $25 per purchase. They'll make 75 bucks on it. Someone will book and the same ascension rate will occur. So they're making money on the front and the back. So you could actually have this as a negative net CPA, which is just like crazy. Um, and then yeah, the ascension rate is huge. So if you can optimize the funnel, look at the differences on these. The big one is this one right here because it's most realistic. Let's say you keep all your Facebook stuff the same and you it cost you 75 bucks here, but you only get 3% to ascend. And then here, $75, but you get 5% to ascend. It drops a,000 bucks off the CPA. And when you're selling 15 units a day, you're you're keeping 15 grand that you're not spending on ads to acquire the same amount of customers. So that's the math. That's the plan. There are some other things on the back end of this portion like the product portal, that's a big one. The Facebook group or whatever community group you guys use is a big one. So nurturing within there. Because when I say these numbers, you know, we have 2,000. Think about that. Like my joke, my sticky note is like everyone is someone like 20080 is 280 people who purchase the product and are in the Facebook group and are consuming the product and you know whatever it is 80% of people that buy info products never open them. You can look how many are open last sign and all that. However many 280 purchased this product and only 81 of them so far have bought the high ticket and all of them are buying this product because they want the result that your backend has right. They want the one that your backend per product what that solves. So being able to come up with a good way to nurture them in the Facebook group provide an immense amount of value but also kind of limiting in the low ticket product to where the real sauce and the real way to get the result the quickest way the fastest way the uh most realistic the you know confidence in it all those ways is through the back end. So doing what you can to get this number into this number right as best you can. So portal Facebook group all those things. Quick update I made this doc below this. So, www.rycl. You have to do WW cuz I broke something on ClickFunnels and I don't care to change it. And it has all the videos. This is day I don't even know 45 in a row of doing these. Um, we are hiring a sales manager right now. It is our biggest kind of choke hold on the business. Marketing is crushing. We are hitting like all-time high or this year all-time high. So, year-to- date uh highest call days in a row and we've hitting them day over day like the same exact volume basically. and we'll do 15 units, then we'll do five units, then we'll do 16 units, then we'll do seven units, then we'll do 14. And it's just like the inconsistency around that um team and execution is something that we need to work on in order to scale because without that feedback loop back to marketing, we don't know what split tests, what funnels, what anything is working because we track everything on marketing back to the actual back-end purchase, not just the cost per lead, cost per book, cost per anything because that doesn't matter. What matters is who actually buys the back end and where the real rorowaz comes from. Okay, so that's the update. Yesterday we did 95,500 actually 95,495 and yeah, we are scaling in the right direction. We've had a few days over 100K. We've had a few days at like 50 to 60 G's. And it's that back and forth. So we're getting in the right direction, but we're still not even close to where we want to be. And next thing to solve for is sales. Doing some backend stuff. I'll make some videos on some updates of where we are and as we come into the end of the month, a month in review. So comment below any questions you guys have. X and comments on here and I will talk with you soon.

# our remote sales team did $71M... here's how. | E44
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLaYpvqNlHk

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we did $71 million in our info coaching business, but broke our sales team. By the end of this, you will know what to do and what not to do to scale your sales team. And I'm going to go through the offers we used to scale from zero to a million a month and then a million to three million a month. Then I'm going to go through the different management structures we used across these scales and then some of the pain points we felt and what you can learn from them. And then I'm going to do some quick data on booking showed offered close and some of the general practices. And then a shameless plug because we are hiring a sales manager right now. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected. The business as a whole has done over 71 million cash collected in total. I'm not selling anything. All right. Only reason I make these videos is to share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year with the goal of finding top talent like I'm asking for today opportunities and build a network of cool people doing the same. All right. So, let's get into it. So, we have done 71 million in total cash, almost 72 now. Uh and our sales team has done close to it's over I believe it's 70 or like 69.5 something like that um because some of it was low ticket prior. So how this all started quick overview is we decided to launch CallFunnel that was selling a 49 uh $497 info product which is crazy behavior if you think about like economics and cost per um but it worked at the time and we only did it at a small scale. So the cost per call was so low, closing rate was so high and uh we were just like so in pocket that it made sense. uh we quickly then jumped up to 997. At this time we are taking phone calls like us as you know uh I was number four or something like that in the company or five somewhere somewhere in that range. Um so the founders are taking it I'm taking it and we some of the initial team are all taking sales calls to get these numbers right we then upped it to $14.97 and at that time that is when this is the number and price we were at by the time they got to uh a million a month. Okay, so we were cranking insane volume of this and then a version of pay plans of this all of an info product. So it had really good um there's very limited cost to fulfill. So the margin was good. It was basically just ad cost and a sales rep. Okay. We then transitioned over to coaching and I believe in the beginning we were selling at around 5,000 for the year, upped it to 6,200 uh quick thereafter and then up to 7200. And between these two ranges is when we got up to around 3 million a month. We technically did 3.7 at our peak month. Uh and that was in Q3 of 2024 in this range. So we did 3.7 here, but really it was new rev that came from the sales team was around down here. Um because we ran a special internally. So just to be transparent. So the management throughout that so you have zero, you have a million at around this and then you have three million up here and the different offers that we were selling at the time and at one point we were overlapping. So management in the beginning it was us. We were taking the sales calls and we were running the sales team. Okay. So, we did that for a while. Like for the first 30 to 50 reps, uh me and one of the co-founders were leading the entire sales team. Um we were taking calls and then got out of that and then we're ramping them. We were interviewing, group interviewing, ramping. Uh I was doing all tech setup. I was running office hours, doing, you know, tech help and teaching them how to do it. Uh at the time, we only hired from our customers, which was like great because, uh at the time, this was an easier sales cycle. So it didn't require as much sales skills, but it if you had the product belief, you already a customer, uh, it just converted really, really well. Um, so we focused on that at that time. Uh, and then one of the top reps just like already had management experience was creme like creme to the creme of closing, crushing it. And we made the mistake of which we didn't know at the time, but like you're supposedly I say it's a mistake because supposedly you're just not supposed to do this. She was great. Um, she did a really good job. You know, there ended up being some issues with it and that's why we ended up changing it. Um, but you're supposedly you're never supposed to make your top rep or a high performer, also a manager. And we didn't know that. So, we did that. Um, but she crushed for us. She was doing, you know, three 400 grand a year as a closer. Um, plus a little bit of management, uh, over, you know, override basically. Um, but yeah, so top rep and that is where we were hitting million- dollar months was with this setup. After that changed, uh, we basically had to rebuild the sales team because there was a, uh, culture issue that occurred throughout this. Like when we lost this, we also lost a grouping of other people. And yeah, again, all good people. All this to say when I'm up here like RCL stream broke whatever a little clickbaity but like I just want to explain the transition of what is going on with us currently what happened with us and you know everyone is doing their role as best as they can to their capacity and this is not to you know on anyone or any structure being wrong and this is full responsibility on us on the people we put in place the structures we gave them the comp models everything I am taking responsibility for that not to say that anyone here is doing anything directly like wrong or didn't perform so agencies uh we had two different agencies that We tried um one was basically just like full outsource and kind of like coaching in on us while we ran it internal didn't super work was like okay but we got some good tactics and things and then we hired one that was like a full outsource uh or full agency that would actually do the whole model for us uh and like come in and like run all the meetings and do all that. And after a bit they're like taking on more clients. And that's really really popular right now in the internet marketing space is like people who do this like this remote or you know multi-management basically like almost as like a sales agency. Uh, and again, some of those guys crush like both in their own business and are doing hundreds of thousands a month for themselves and then also for their clients. So, shout out to them. But, uh, for us, both of the people that we use were like, "Oh, no, you need an internal." Um, so we got somebody who had experience in this and already had a was running a pod within a larger company that was more than our revenue. So, at this point, we're only at like a million. So, we brought in a sales manager that was doing about three times our overall volume in just one pod of another company. um and he came in as full manager and rockstar. So he was the transition from here to here and in within that first year uh he brought us from one to three million. Okay. So that is that I don't think you'll see it in this one but there's another chart that is the 12 million that was the year prior. So he led the charge on that hired managed all of the things for that growth. Okay. Now he's the first person we've ever hired I'm pretty sure ever hired that came in with experience. everyone else within the company was like basically every time we hit a new record it was their personal record too. Me included 100% me included. Um so he was the first person we ever hired with experience came in ran the playbook and could you know basically say oh yeah I did it over here from this to this and now I'm going to implement those systems and it worked. So that was like a big light bulb moment for us that was like oh okay so this does work. we now have, you know, we have the facilities for that to be able to pay um for good talent and set up in right performance models to get people paid and to get the performance we want. Um so yeah, as that scaled uh we got to too many basically like direct reports. So then had pods so we had different um current closers that were like high performers that then were also pod leaders of I want to say it was like 10 to or like 12 to 15 under each because we got up to like 30 closers. Now we scaled too heavy. There are I mean I think I put that in this pain section but we scaled too heavy into the people and like there wasn't as high of an output per person maybe as would have been like a crazy high performing sales team that was numbers driven but like momentum was there. So like the closing rates were there like it was there at least to what our expectations were at the time and what like the average was. So the high the average was high in our minds for what that fra like in our frame of reference. And again we had never done these numbers. Uh we only knew our numbers here and then now all of a sudden we're selling coaching which is like a different number. uh or a different percentage and all that. So that's what we knew at the time. So pain around Q end of Q3 into Q4 marketing exploded. We had big acquisition issues and I could talk for a long time about that, but we had issues around um the pixel. We had issues around volume. We were getting capped when we were optimizing for certain events. Uh we transitioned over to the native events. We had agencies that were crazy billables while the CPA was going up. So, we're like burning whatever thousand a month paying an agency while also the CPA is rising. So, like double whammy. We're just getting railed. And again, that's on us because we agreed to these comp terms. We agreed to have people, you know, we could have fired anybody anytime, right? And in any direction and like tried to rehire, done it ourselves. And like we clearly didn't have the skill to do it. We didn't hire correctly to do it. So, that's on us. At that time, we had also just moved everyone from 1099 to W2 for a future focus, for legality coverage, for all the things. It's just like it the book would say it's the right thing to do. Um and so we did. So we moved everyone to W2 and that then created bases and when marketing volume is half the smart thing to do would have been like you know basically offboard people so that the volume stays high with the performance people and we didn't do that. We kept people at bases. We were okay with paying bases even if volume wasn't there. So both the close rates and the stuff were not necessarily where they needed to be and the volume too. So it's another double whammy. Not good. Um so yeah, so that was a big pain point and still kind of continues. It creates a comfort mentality of where you can just make a base no matter what instead of like an eat what you kill. Um but I think it creates a better like fostered culture. Everyone gets benefits. Everyone gets 401k. We're a long-term company, right? We have uh um we're a long-term company, right? So it was in the best interest of both the future and that. But in the short term burned a lot. Trainer confusion. We started throwing at it left and right. Right? We're hiring this trainer, hiring that trainer, trying to have them come in. They're on different scripts whether the sales manager is like into it or not. Like they like portions, so they're saying just listen to this and we're paying 10 grand or 20 like just bad volume versus quality for the longest amount of time even kind of to this day. Like we're at, you know, 170 something whatever a lot of bookings uh per day in 30-minute increments even though the calls on average will close in 40ome minutes. So people put like differentiator blocks between them and all this stuff. And we've always focused on this and now we're leaning more towards a quality approach. So like confirming every call prior, taking them off calendar, doing that like all the top guys always say, we did not do that. We were dumb and now we're trying to be a little smarter and learn from our mistakes. Um and then ramping. When we were doing this, we were just ramping left and right. We're just going this, this, like just trying to get people in. High churn, high whatever. And that was actually technically when we were 1099 a little bit on W2, but it slowed down a lot then when we were 1099. So it's like in out, in out, in out. you know, we have hundred, you know, we're on sales ID hundred and hundreds of something. Um, so yeah, so we've done a lot there. So that's kind of the general gist of what has got us there. And then now where we're back in pocket. I made a video saying we did 1.6 uh last month, which is really bad for us. Um, and I've got all my data over here, so excuse me for looking or talking this direction. And now it's really just coming down to consistency. So we are at the point where I just posted this where we're hiring for this position, and this is April 25th of 2025. Um, so yeah, we are hiring for somebody to take this role. Um, our sales manager got us to where we are today. He's an absolute rockstar. Um, but where his heart is and where his direction is, he wants to go do his own thing and like scale and do his own thing and we support that, right? Like people grow people and like go do your thing. Um, so we support that and he is being, you know, awesome about an overlap transition. So we're looking for someone who's going to take us from the three to the 10 million a month range or technically, you know, closer to two right now in current model. So yeah, so that's what we are hiring for right now. So just as kind of like an overall where we got to and where we are today. We're looking for the consistency. We're looking for the performance savage mentality. We're looking for someone who can like entrepreneur fullr run this thing. Um also during this entire time we had a setter in the last month we've had a setter division completely built from a really experienced performance hire. Um and that just goes to show they're a complete entrepreneur. They're running their own whole division. They're onboarding. They're ramping their own people. They're managing their own people. And it's working. It is working extremely well and the math backs out for us and for me as the person who runs that which is good. So I'm just going to go through some quick numbers on this and just kind of like laugh a little. So you got your booking to your show. Everything's a funnel. Uh you've got your booking to a showed which different companies will have a 30% up to an 85% of showed calls. Once someone shows the offer rate will be anywhere from 30% to 90% which again crazy variance. And then once someone is offered, there's a five to 40% close rate at these crazy averages. Okay? So like these are numbers I pulled from random different groups and like what I've heard and people who DM and all that and the different things that are driving these is so different based on offer, based on flow, based on everything. But basically the framing of how the booking is coming in and the source in which it does is will completely determine the show rate. So framing in the sense that oh if you show up you're going to get a free car, you know, you're going to get a 99% show rate or whatever if it's actually believable. Source being if you're just ramming them in through somewhere or you just like autobook people and they don't even know about the call. Like think in extremes. It's way easier for that for me if I think in extremes to like what direction the percent would go. If the source was someone got auto booked versus the source was like they had to call someone inhouse 14 times to get this booking and they finally got it like they're going to show, right? So a big difference for us right now. the low ticket ascension stuff very high uh when talking to a setter the framing they come in the expectation for the call why they're there um and then also the uh DTA is actually much lower which makes sense because it's less friction they just land here they can consume or not consume the VSSL before they do an application and book I have other videos on the channel talking about what funnels are running how we're running them at scale uh where we're at so framing and source once someone is showed with the offer rate is going to land somewhere in quality and you playing God. So, if the quality is not there, they're not going to offer them. And then there's also kind of a double-edged sword. Our our sales or our director for Outbound um gave me this said this the other day and he was like, "Oh, you know, people playing God, like thinking that someone can't afford it when maybe they can on financing, maybe they can in general and you just don't know." Um so, quality and playing God in that way for the offer rate. And then objections and follow-up for offer to close. So, are you able to handle objections? Do you have the skill of doing it? Did you know take authority in the call? Did you do all those things? and then managing your pipeline for those that need the follow-up. Um, someone is going to be able to give you this 50 times better. I'm just going to share like our version of this. So, for us, we're constantly working on showed and again, someone is going to be able to do this 50 times better. There are people that do three, five, whatever million a month teaching all of this only. And I'm not here to teach you this. I'm here to talk to you about our numbers and some simple ways to do this. There's 40 things that go into a show, rate, there's 40 things that go into an offer, rate, and there's 40 things that go into a close that I don't even know about. All right? So I'm just talking from where my understanding is of the level and some of the simple things that we can you know cover the the 101 version. So 30 to 80% show right now we're humming in like the 50 60 range and when things are dialed it's in the 70. So the pockets the good pockets like I said source is getting 75. The bad pocket the GTA the thing we're testing is getting like 40. So it's like oh okay interesting. So the blended shores out to there for the offer rate for us it is actually very low right now which is like we're being told is not good and something we just like didn't really know and that's both a mix of quality as well as a sales rep skill and team like understanding and culture. So that is again sales manager opportunity and then the live call close rate is low right so it's not you know a general KPI is 20 a lot of like sikos say it should be 30 ours is below both of those um so it's something we're actively working on and we're building out and that is both in sales team that is both in sales training that is the people who are doing it that is the uh expectations that is all the things okay so there's so much room on here and we're looking to bring on the right person who can run a performance culture run the entire thing inside of inside of the company because we're trying to take this thing to you know 10 million a month So right now we are humming and sitting where we're at. The marketing is there. It's basically ready to take off. But we can't scale marketing until we get feedback from sales in terms of literal closes. We scale everything based on the uh marketing dollar or the cash collected dollars on the back end as the feedback loop. Not oh what's the cost per booking like yes that's important but what's more important is what is it back into? What's the rorowaz? What's the CPA on different ads, different flows, different funnels? And that is how we are able to get the feedback to lean into and scale. And right now because of the inconsistency within the sales portion of the percentage, we'll have the same amount of bookings four days in a row and we'll go from 15 to seven to 15 to five, right? So once we have consistency there, we are then able to lean into pockets that have lower cost per acquisition and ideally also you know lower I mean guess it doesn't matter as much but like lower other metrics as a lead runner because we'll know. So hopefully that was a little helpful. Um daily update. Oh, I decided I'm not going to put the numbers on here so people can't just skip to that. So you got to hear it. Um, but yesterday in total, I got to pop it. Yesterday was I think 60. Yesterday was seven units and 59 units. So, seven high, 59 low, and yeah, about 60 G's. So, today's off to a ripper, though. Back to what I'm saying. It's like low day, high day, low day, high day. We've had two or three days over 100 already now in the last couple. So, we're in the right direction. Like I said, I have full conviction in that. And that's that. So, if you know anybody, I may have filled this by the time that this, you know, is actually getting views in a couple days, but we're on the hunt. We want somebody who has the same drive and passion and stuff we do about building businesses and about serving people. We have hundreds and thousands of reviews. It's a good product. It's a good business. Um, so yeah. So, X is where to find me. And then I also made this doc www. ryanclog.comdoc. and you can see all the videos, all the topics, all the things. All right, so hope that was helpful. Again, I'm not the guru of any of this. There are people that that's the reason I have never really done it. Um, I'm not good at it, so or I'm not the best at it. I've sold, but that's it. So, someone else can teach you how to do this and understand this better. Um, but this is just our story, our journey, and where we're looking to grow. So, appreciate you guys. Touch him.

# we send 6.8M emails a month... (full $$ system breakdown)  | E43
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bstGqHmEfM

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we send emails that actually convert into dollars. We send hundreds of thousands of emails a day. And I'm going to do a full breakdown of our email funnel, the workflows, the campaigns, and the technical sauce behind it, which is super important, and then give you the content and context of where these live within our funnel, so you can copy paste this system and get the same results. We have done 70 million in info and coaching, 30 million of which was in the last year. And I am not selling anything. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, these right here, so notice the 15% open rate. That's cuz we sent it out this morning. Um, so there's like a real screenshot right now. Uh, we are sending these twice a day to 106,000 and growing on our lead list and getting 40% open rates. Okay. So, for us, I just want to explain, everything is a funnel. I always say this, the goal here is to get someone an email to deliver, someone to open it, someone to click it, and then do set action, convert. So whether that's become an, you know, become a client, uh, buy something direct, whatever. That's a simple funnel. Okay. Now, we're going to get directly into these workflows and just go through this fast. So for us in a VSSL call funnel, you're going to have an opt no app. So somebody who opts into the funnel and to watch the training, but then does not apply. You're going to have the next, which is someone who applies but then does not book. You're going to have a successful booking and booking nurture and I'll break those down. You're going to have a post-purchase and then you're going to have a re-engage. There are plenty of more, but these are like the core ones. Okay, so looking at these op no app, how we're going to frame this and send this. You are going to initially send them the training replay and there are tons of people who go like really in-depth in this and it's in like every VSSL course, but you're going to send them a training replay. You know, basically, hey, you opted in for this. Here it is. In all of our VSSLs, we have at the very end of it or if you stay to the end, you get this bonus and we have like this, you know, sexy bonus that if they stay to the end, so then we send them that and then the rest of it is awareness content of or the level of awareness they're at which is like they don't really know who we are. This is their first time in um top a funnel. So we are sending them uh content that's based on that and it's all very very content driven which I'm going to get into. That's the op no uh opt no app. The next being the app no book. Someone has applied but not booked. So, we're going to send them, did something break? Did you mean to, you know, we see that you applied, but you didn't book? Is everything okay? And then awareness in that same way. So, you can only hit them with so many in my opinion or our opinion uh of these like, you know, abandoned cart style thing, but that's at some level what this is. So, we go through that and then awareness content. So, they're clearly deeper in the funnel. They have the training. They've already seen that. And we have a couple other pages that are very similar to this. And then from there, you're going to go to the booking success. I have a full video on the channel where I talk about uh our entire call confirmation sequence and how that works. But we send these actually from the SP and it's going to be like a confirmation you're booking uh you know get them excited. Make sure you watch XYZ pages and then the SP reminders are going to come in dynamic that are going to be based on the time of the call 3 hours before whatever. I have an complete video on there that you can see the show rate video on my channel and then booking nurture. This one is going to be also in that um in that video, but it's going through basically like the hammer them Jeremy Haynes uh video. So, he's talking about how you're hitting them with objection blocks, reviews, testimonials, all this between the booking when it occurs and I'm sorry, when the booking is actually booked and then when the call occurs. Okay, so these are super important. And then post-purchase, these ones just have like, you know, insane engagement, insane open rates. Uh so, it's just like really good to for the email reputation and uh domain. So this great decision, you know, hype up email, avoid buyer remorse, and then access onboard. All right. So now we're going to go into the campaigns, which is what these are right here. So for campaigns, we are sending two a day, every day. All right. And these are going to these 30-day opens. So inside, we use HubSpot, but inside you're going to have 30-day uh availability to see who opened your emails, clicked them, and gave like all these different stats. So, for us right now, this is the one that's working best. We have 30-day open plus 90-day click, which is obviously going to be overlap. So, someone who clicked has a higher intent than someone who just opened. So, you're just going to assume, right? So, you have 30-day opens plus 90-day clicks, and then you're excluding any buyers because all of these are content driven and content web style content. Okay? So, what I mean by that, almost all of these emails that are in here are nondirect like CTA. Every single one is hey you know XYZ sales copy portion basically info sales copy and then hey go watch it here and it's pushing them to a page on site. Now we did a we worked hard to make sure that we had a content web in place which a lot of people don't have you know who are just like running an offer. They have like a three-page website. We built ours to be hundreds of pages of different content pieces that hit people in different places and spaces um of like their journey. Okay. So we have in ours you know the three or four different buckets of health are like the messaging angles and then we have content within each of them. So everything from like how much does it cost to um you know training around for us you know menopause or macronutrient or you know these different buckets and works the same way in internet marketing works the same way in make money online space. You just need what are the messaging things and then walkthroughs. So we push them to the site as valuedriven. We get them to consume content on site and then have more recommended under it. So they just get in this web of consuming more and more content ending up on a testimonial all buried with CTAs. And a majority of these are going to drive applications because that's where we push them. We never push someone direct. The the automations are where you're going to do the contextual stuff like push them to um a booking for example or push them to something uh else. But the application is like the main CTA that's all over the site and then is also the main CTA that'll come through the emails. Okay. the automations pick up for where you want someone to book directly and that also helps when you're using routing and things like uh qualifiers because you need to route them to a DQ versus like a quality booking and you need to do that through an application or through what you have it stored in the CRM which I don't need to go into that too too much but technical side of things. This is where we're going to spend most of the time. So before I get into this I am no pro. Uh Trey Ericson is like really really good at this. He owns Mail Genius I think he bought and then email deliverability and some other stuff. um met him at a couple uh mastermind or like event stuff and he's like a really nice guy. We've also paid him multiple times um to implement some of this for us because we had issues when Google updated their promo strat and like all that. So for a quick explainer on this, I'm not sure if I did this yet, but the these are the two a day emails. So email so like yesterday email one, email two, these are going to a campaign list. Now, we technically have a million1 contacts in our uh CRM, but the 30-day open, 90-day click, no buyer list is only 106,000. Okay? So, in this re-engage sequence, and I could make a whole video on this, but you're essentially recapturing and grabbing the people that fell off this list and getting them to engage. So you're sending a super low volume. So you're not nuking the which I'll get into the technical part of the domain sender, but you are sending to these people or to the people who are not in this list and then trying to get them to re-engage. And that's why this is increasing. So it's both new leads and then re-engage because we have call it 2,000 emails going out a day to people that fell off this list to try and get them back asking a question. Hey, you know, we just rolled out this new thing. Uh you know, test question mark as a subject line. We test different stuff all the time. Um, but the goal is to just stay, you know, get open rates basically because as soon as they get an open or a click, they come back into the main list and then you can email the same and then, you know, it's it's a hotter pocket. So that's the whole goal of the re-engage, but these are our stats right now for our campaigns. Um, which is actually crazy because our automations right now are less than this, which is, you know, not really normal in my opinion. Um, so we're working on that right now, but these are the daily we send out every day, twice a day. Okay. Now, Troy Crushes, we paid him for a bunch of these different pieces, but we're going to get into it right now. So, footer sauce. What I mean by this, and I don't want to show exact like technicals because it has like, you know, private information in it, but for our footer on ours, we were told that the info versus like sales copy percentage on the overall email is a big determining factor on where it delivers in general. like so either like if it's going to go to primary versus promo and then also um if it just like the deliverability in general and then how they view it how much spam it has. So you can use tools like mail meteor for spam checker um and it'll tell you like spammy versus promotional versus whatever type content. There's a bunch of tools out there these email guys like go way down a rabbit hole and you can go on you know nothing held back Facebook group. There's a ton of those and uh email guys in there. So, this is not meant to be like the there are smarter people that do this, but or are better at this and know this space better than I do. Um, I'm just talking about like our experience. So, info versus sales. So, the goal is to get that info portion up way larger than the sales portion. And when you do that, it looks like a more info, more real email and then delivers to primary more often is like the general gist. Now, I'm sure there's like, you know, 80 20% and this and that and like, but we just don't Yeah, I just don't have that info. So, for this two different ways you can do this. um that we've done it. One is just like make your actual emails better in terms of like info versus like sales copy and crazy stuff like you still want them to convert. So you got to dance that line, but the other way is putting stuff into your footer. So, one of the things that was recommended that I saw online and then that Troy implemented for us and some other stuff is uh putting in the footer like sections of your terms or like company bio and information and doing that because that's like all pure info and then having it way smaller on the bottom and then also customizing out that section in the bottom of your footer to be like haven't applied yet or you know want to become an XYZ you know client click here to apply then it's bio information then it's whatever like just like basic information that is smaller and all the way on the bottom not part of the main copy and then that will offset the info to sales percentage and should get you better open or get you better like you know in the right inbox basically uh rates. So I said spam checker technical side of things uh dedicated IP once you get to a certain level it makes sense to have one of these where I mean like this entire thing is like the the simply put way is if you look at your open rates your click rates or whatever and like things are good like that's what you're basing this off if you have a 10% open rate and like a 2% click rate like something's wrong. Okay. And when I say a funnel the first thing you need to optimize for are they getting delivered. So you'll have a little delivery percentage. Ours is like 99%. Are you getting opens? If you're getting 10%, that's where it broke. So, now you need to fix that. Why are you not getting opens? Is it your subject? Um, is it your subject line? Is it your uh who you're sending from? Is it the that's landing in the wrong inbox? It's going to junk. It's somewhere there. That's how you solve for that. Next one. If you're not getting a click, it's the email copy. It's how it's written. It's how it's framed. It's how it is uh, you know, just valuable enough. It's just like, you know, you're not offering something good enough. And then, do they convert? Once you get them to the page, is the page then doing the action with the copy, with the video, with the whatever to get them to the next step, which generally is an application, uh, or to book a call. Okay? So, like you need to look at everything like a funnel if you're look if or I look at everything like a funnel. You don't necessarily have to, but like it's very easy to solve this way. If you're not getting deliverability, technical issue, if you're not getting opens, subject line or um, you know, another technical issue with like how it's being delivered plus, right? Um, if you're not getting clicks, it's in the email copy. If you're not getting converts, it's in the page, right? So like thinking about it like that, same way you think about copy. Headline sells a sub headline, sub headline sells the next, right? Like that's how you do this. So we moved to a dedicated IP within HubSpot after we got to a certain volume. We send like I have to look, but like last I look it was over five million emails a month. So we moved to a dedicated IP with them and it helps. It basically puts you so you're not on a shared setup. So you your data is only your um or like your reputation is only based on your reputation, not on a shared setup. Um so this can be very very helpful for tracking. We use Hyros and HubSpot. So HubS like you have to think about it as like how much like who has the data. So Hyros has it. We put uh we append in the URL like a Hyros parameter and the email and you can look up on Hyro stuff how they do this but basically it'll track it so you can see if they came from email somewhere in the buyer journey so you can run lastclick reports on like what did these emails generate when you know all time if they clicked on an email what happened with them throughout the buyer journey. So we use Hyrosse for like the overall buyer journey track but inside HubSpot you have to look at like what data do you have in there. So they have the email clicks, they have the page views, they have all the contact info, they have the actions they take uh and they also have deals in there. So because we use deals for um our sale for the sales process inside HubSpot, you're able to when you mark a deal one, it can see that so that those uh emails can have like deal revenue assigned to them. So you can see oh these emails went to that rough metric. We don't like directly use it to make decisions. Um, but it is it it's good to see, right? It's like just good data. We don't necessarily just like rely on it. We use Hyros more for that and that's what we track week over week on clicks, opens. Um, I guess clicks and opens and all that come from HubSpot. But in Hyros is where we get it where what happens with the actual action and where is it on the buyer journey. Brand sending versus solo sending. Um, so I said in here for brand, these are all branded emails. So we'll send from you know brand name at or you know expertname at companyame.com. That's where all these will send. These right here will send direct from the sales rep which you can do dynamically inside HubSpot. Um but you just want to make sure like so for example you'll have like you know Ryan companyame.com is the one that sends all the mass emails. So there's 5 million emails that go out from this. We use a support at for like kind of the main there. You can do a bunch of stuff if you want with like reply twos, especially if you have SDRs that manage inboxes. And then when you do these like workflows or dedicated side off ones that are lower in the funnel, like a booking success, you can then dynamically put the contact owner in as a sales rep and that's how we do it. Okay? So that does not conflict or have issues. Um, and that's what gets us these results. And then Google Postmaster, um, you can really go down a rabbit hole here, but Google Postmaster, you'll be able to see IP reputation, delivery errors, domain reput, like just lights them up basically green, yellow, red, and then percentages. and it'll just tell you like how are you doing over 7day all the way up to like I believe 120 or 180 day. Um so we use this all the time and ours is like perfectly clean now and that it was not for a long time. Um and then yeah promo versus primary is kind of like a final check thing. We've had people come in and do it before and like in the end they just send themselves a test email and look at it. So like that's still what we do. So we'll send it to ourselves as a test email and see where it pops in promo versus primary and a lot of that comes back to this content that exists within here. Okay. So, someone had asked me to make this video. So, I hope this is helpful. I've already done a bit on this, but I just want to go a little bit deeper into like our technical setup. Um, I can get more stats on this and if you want like hit me on X or something and I can give more detail of what you're kind of looking for specifically with email. Yesterday, we did 106,000 cash collected with 15 high ticket and 52 low ticket. low ticket is still low um because we have not been able to scale up with the CPA which is not good uh because the goal is to get this like you know in the hundreds and if we can't scale it you know past 50 we need to work on some things before we can do so uh but this is backing out like insane and then high ticket that's a pretty solid number for us for the amount of calls that we booked so in the six figs which is good now we just need to maintain it over x amount of time and obviously we crushed at the end of the night last night like 10 something this Eastern so I made a dock I broke ClickFunnels so I don't I don't know how to fix this with the www eas easily, but www.rronclawet.com/docck. I have every single video. I'm on day 42 or 43 or something like that of making these in a row. Uh, and you can go here and you can see like what the main idea is. The title is always changing, so it's sometimes hard to know. So, I just put a main idea, link to the YouTube video, and then the category. So, you can filter by category and see like, oh, I just want the tech stuff. Oh, I just want marketing. Oh, I just want sales. Um, but yeah. So, on here as well, there's a topic request form if you want to fill that out. So, hope this was valuable. A little bit different one today that's kind of like more technical and a little bit like, you know, it's clouds and dirt. So, hope it was helpful and talk to you guys

# I Talked to a Billionaire for 46min (Raw Talk)  | E42
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7dVc9dqX3A

cool we recording now we are awesome man so 
I randomly hit you up on Twitter because our   friends were talking to each other and I thought 
it would be cool to hop on in Zoom and talk about   what you do see if we can pull some value out 
i really love all the books in your background   i'm curious is this like Tai Lopez style where you 
may have not read them or No no no i have in fact   I've read like the joke is I've read like 80% of 
them and then the bottom ones like I've had these   I started this when I was like 16 i'm 28 now but 
I literally have moved all over the US and I've   brought them every time and it's like the hardest 
part of moving so I bring them and they just keep   stacking but the bottom 20% is like the classic 
Amazon grab it send it to the door add it to the   shelf and it has just died there so my consumption 
of books has dramatically decreased i'm so much   more audible and podcast now so much more which is 
like I'm not a huge fan of actually like I think   I should get back into it because I've learned a 
lot from those yeah it's funny you say that like   I spent all of my 20s reading physical books and 
a good portion of my 30s and I also moved around   i moved around generally every year for over 
a decade like different cities yeah and same   problem moving the books and I did it for a long 
time when I moved to Miami uh I got rid of all of   them except my like old psychology books so my my 
bookshelf is like all psychology books from the   1930s 40s 50s and 60s like the source material 
exactly the original i think I've got a I think   I've got an OG Think You Grow Rich hell yes i have 
like a OG OG which is hilarious because I actually   I opened it the other day and my first thing into 
business was trying to do like private equity   style stuff i like dropped out of college i went 
to ASU and the bookmark I had in here was from a   uh like jeweler in Newport cuz I moved to Newport 
and tried to like figure that out i had no idea   what I was doing it was like true ignorance is 
bliss we were trying to what I now know is like   a roll up we were trying to roll up a bunch of 
like alternative finance or alternative fitness   locations physical locations we got like 14 under 
LOI we rented a Tahoe drove around the US hit   everyone on LinkedIn got franchise or approval 
like did all this stuff and at the end I was   going to make a deal closing fee like as like 
an independent sponsor so it was me a business   partner and an attorney it was us three because 
he obviously a lot of legal work and I wanted to   buy an AP at the end of it and it is AP Royal 
Oak Black Dial Auto and it's like the tax it's   them financing it it's like a full breakdown and 
I found it the other day when I grabbed this book   and it's like hilarious but it's like it's just 
like h just funny stuff like that wait a second   financing it tell me you didn't finance the watch 
i didn't finance it no no i'm saying when I was   18 years old trying to do this I did that no no 
no i did not finance this but it's just like it's   funny this is like the watch I wanted as an idea 
yeah yeah do not finance finance watches yeah just   like funny it's like just things so back to like 
the psychology part of it and all that it's like   those are the core books in here anything like 
skill oriented or yeah I mean on all of that is   either I've learned through courses I'm a course 
junkie I have paid for guru course mastermind like   everything you can imagine and either then taken 
pieces and parts of that and then really learned   it by applying it and like learning what we by 
breaking things and running it active but yeah   so like skills there mindset frameworks all that 
kind of stuff books car that's super cool like I   you know my backstory is is a little crazy but 
um at one point I had started my first physical   business and you know I'm turning 41 in a couple 
weeks so when I started we didn't have iPhones we   didn't have eBay even like we didn't have anything 
and um I ended up going all the way down to North   Carolina i found a warehouse that had store 
returned liquidations and they were aggregating   all the store returns from Harbor Freight tools 
and selling them uh as salvage by the truckload   so full full 53 foot semi full of tools it's 
like 65,000 pounds of truckload it's crazy and   then eBay started and I bought a truckload risked 
everything I had got it up to Michigan and started   selling it on eBay and then got crushed when they 
implemented feedback so yeah the feedback system   was new and there were no rules and they were 
trigger happy and all this crazy stuff and so   that business failed miserably i lost everything 
in Michigan uh Metro Detroit okay yeah that's   where I am right now oh cool really that's where 
you ended up where yeah well okay so yeah long   story but that's where I'm from initially is 
like around Ann Arbor call it like in that area   and then went to Arizona for college that I was 
there for a semester lived in my dorm for a year   bounced around the Newport thing Chicago whatever 
and then last three were in Puerto Rico and then   when I ended the Puerto Rico gig I was like fam 
friends girlfriend thing like go back to Michigan   for now and now I got to figure out where to go 
because it's cold and I haven't done a winter too   long what's the actual city you're in uh right 
now Novi oh cool very cool yeah i grew up in   Rochester Hills and before I moved to Miami uh I 
was in Lake Angeles if you're familiar yeah yeah   yeah yeah it's hilarious wild uh and by the way 
please escape like it's Yeah oh no no i'm telling   you like that was my this was my first winter 
because I got back end of 2024 calendar year   like to finish out my days and then did a winter 
here and was like I mean I'm still doing a winter   here it's April and uh I'm like "Yeah I'm good i'm 
good on this." So Scottdale probably I have family   and friends there and there's a lot of networks 
so I think that's the spot yeah yeah yeah that's   good so I mean I picked Miami because my business 
partner was there it was a random choice but Miami   is great i just feel like it's a little too it's 
busy it's busy there's a lot of party availability   not like there's not in Scottsdale but like that 
kind of stuff and like I have I had that part of   my life and like I exited it whatever 10 12 months 
ago uh and I'm like I need to stay far away from   that like I ripped hard and I'm done doing that 
so well that's good miami yeah i I mean look on   the Miami thing I I went there but I'm older and 
you know first of all if you're if you're not   really successful do not move to Miami because 
you need a six-f figureure burn budget just to   go out to eat like oh yeah stupid and stupid um 
but I have hundreds of clients there and I didn't   know that and so my friend circle is customers 
like I generally meet people like I meet you   i don't go out to real world meet people generally 
that's it's um through friends with friends and so   when I got there I just started hanging out with 
my friends and I don't I like I have a Miami no   new friends rule like I I don't seek out people 
there um and I don't drink at all and so the   party scene just kind of I like the music so I go 
out for that but it doesn't affect me so but yeah   if you if you just got done with that do not move 
there because it's [ __ ] No I mean I was going to   say I just it's just done there's there's AP's 
lost because of that there's in Miami specific   there's just there's just rough times like just 
bad person overall you could just classify me as   as a bucket for a group of years there but um no 
I have a buddy that's from here that's a little   a little bit younger than you um but he has a 
physical ecom business where they have like a   China uh manufacturing setup and all this and it's 
like aftermarket parts and they're based out of   here but he spends six months in Miami and just 
loves it it's like the people the connects like   he just lives that life so he kind of does the 
what do they call it snowboarding but I don't know   sounds like a lot to me i like one place one spot 
one thing for that at least and then pop around   when you want to have fun it's tough in the summer 
there like I moved in the summer it's like living   in boil it's like living in boiling water so last 
year uh last year I took my girl to La Hoya and   then we went to Huntington Beach and then I had a 
bunch of trade shows and so uh we kind of escaped   the summer and this year we're going to escape 
the summer too um but you know healthy lifestyle   wise it's really an amazing place most fit city in 
the country when I moved back to Michigan I gained   a whole shitload of weight as you can imagine and 
then stay locked inside yeah i went to Miami lost   nearly 40 pounds and then uh I'm back up 15 
um and so it's been a good influence on me um   anyways real real quick but when I was 20 and that 
business failed Oh yeah sorry we derailed that   was my That was my bad we're in Michigan yeah the 
truckload the truckload business failed miserably   and I had to move back into my parents' basement 
i lost everything i lost my friends because they   worked for me by the way don't ever hire friends 
Twitter space like it's just don't just don't do   it yeah all this is targeted to Twitter by the 
way all of this content is strictly for Twitter   yeah yeah so like don't hire your friends don't 
buy inventory on credit cards when you have no   money like it's uh not smart don't go celebrate 
your first win by blowing all your your cash in   in Windsor partying with your friends like all 
all bad things yeah and so I moved back into my   parents' basement and I I effectively was lost and 
just had no idea what I was going to do had like   40 or $50,000 in credit card debt and investor 
debt and I was just ruined as a kid and it was   reading that really really changed my life um 
first I started reading about leadership which   made me realize that I sucked and needed to be 
much better uh about considering other people   and serving them and then I started reading about 
marketing and internet marketing and read a lot of   books on that and then that's what really pushed 
me to uh focus on marketing on the internet which   I discovered affiliate marketing and I went from 
negative $50,000 to essentially millionaire in a   very short period of time and never turned back 
so but it was it was books that saved my life   and I I think it's really cool that you read a 
lot and I know that most successful people that   uh I know read a ton and you know it's just a 
super powerful thing um speaking of which Yeah   I do wait is this you this is you is this you yeah 
yeah okay so no when I moved to Puerto Rico I did   not That was the only time I moved somewhere and 
didn't bring everything cuz when I first got down   there I was like I'm committing to three years but 
like I still don't kind of know yet i I'm going to   get a rental then I'll buy because of all like 
0% 4% game and like you have to buy to get that   one whatever um so I didn't bring all the books 
but I would buy them randomly and it would take   you know a two weeks to get a book anywhere or 
anything shipped depending on what you're buying   in Puerto Rico but yeah that this was one of 
the five or 10 books that I bought over that   time because again my reading and physical books 
has gone like this so over that last three years   it's only been a handful of books but yeah I 
uh I read this and what I actually did which   is hilarious i started to read this and was like I 
skimmed it and the reason I skimmed it is because   prior to that I sat in a cigar lounge and watched 
for two days the entire YouTube version yeah so   when I read this I was like not to say I already 
know it but like it was very framework driven on   like or you used a lot of the same like stories 
and paths and stuff and like I had literally just   watched that because I were Yeah like in in A to 
Z the entire thing that's so crazy bro that like   you and I have never met you have my book on your 
shelf and you you watched that crazy YouTube thing   that I did i think it was like six years ago how 
many hours is that it's 25 yeah no I watched the   entire thing yeah and I did it uh I did it in a 
couple weeks and uh did it all off of those slides   no single take no edits no anything just brain 
dump um and that was crazy how that changed our   business by the way when I released that it was 
like I think we had five people and including me   and my business partner and five team yeah total 
just and we were losing money um a lot because our   engineers are adtech engineers from California so 
they don't make 50k and now we have uh now we have   over a hundred people wow and I think a lot of 
it comes from giving away that knowledge in that   course it's so cool to hear people uh actually 
watch it i need to do another one yeah yeah i mean   I don't know i I obviously that's how I record all 
the stuff I make now is like that raw version i   don't have scripts i don't have anything like yes 
you eventually kind of like yap and ramble and go   in directions maybe that weren't expected but like 
as long as you know it or you know like they're   valuable i think it's helpful to do that and I 
think it's cleaner cut that way versus like some   chopped and perfect dialed in thing like there's 
a time and place for both right there's a time and   place but yeah no I was so I was in PR and I was 
going to a cigar lounge every single day and just   like post it up i would go I would go gym shower 
walk and that would be my walk and then I would   sit in a scar lounge and I have uh two buddies 
down there i had like very very limited friends   i was super even to this day like I live in this 
cave like I do this and this is the first time I'm   like posting on X and YouTube and like trying to 
make friends in the space more so cuz I was like   I don't have a lot of mutual interests with a lot 
of like normal people or you know what I mean like   in that like yeah the average person wants to do 
things with sports and this and that and like it's   just not where I sit and understanding like I just 
don't and like all the power to them it's just not   where like my interest lies so I was like "What 
if I did it the other way around and just tried to   find friends this way?" And you know 30 days in it 
is clearly working which I'm happy about but the   one like friend I had down there that actually was 
down there before I got down there and digitally   uh him and another guy do a ton through uh Ringba 
and so they're like ACA Medicare debt like big big   lead genen guys just two guy lean team and they 
are like they're rock stars like they've taught   me everything I know about the space they've 
taught me and I do a like I'll build a bunch   of tech stuff so I've been in your platform to do 
tons of different tech like I do their posts from   this to that and like storing stuff in air table 
and like passing back conversions and red track   back and forth like I've set a ton of stuff up in 
the platform for that um but I've never direct run   my own i've scaled some or ran some of theirs 
that I've been on um like you know we basically   can spend as much as possible on this we just need 
more eyes on ad accounts and I'm like yeah cool   i'll do it for a month it's like I've done that 
but that's the only thing I've ever directly done   in your guys' platform wild uh also by the way 
everybody this was not sponsored this is sponsored   uh this is not know my phone watch my course work 
with my customers i don't know who the Puerto   Rico people are yeah no he told me to talk about 
paper call masterclass book uh his YouTube series   and talk about his software i don't know it was 
weird uh actually I don't sell anything anymore   Ryan like I don't uh I don't you don't need to i 
don't purposely push that well what I what I want   to do and what's important to me is helping other 
people be successful and so that's why I started   tweeting i know that my personality is a little 
bit crazier more intense than most and raw and I   I don't care like that's authentic to me um but I 
really like to deliver value and that just draws   people in and and they can see what we're doing 
like Ringa's big enough that they can go "Oh who's   this Adam guy go find information and figure it 
out at this So I don't um I don't generally like   to sell or or push it i'm kind of like a mascot 
at this point but yeah um like you same thing i   started tweeting because one of my friends was 
tweeting and I thought it was funny jason Apple   Bum who I've known for over a decade and I don't 
know I just wanted to start to publicly engage   and I tried to do this on Instagram uh a couple 
years ago and you know I have like 7,000 followers   they're all industry or something but I can't drop 
knowledge on Instagram right like I can't what am   I going to do like I just I just post pictures and 
[ __ ] it doesn't do anything so I really like how   X does that um anyways I wanted to ask you about 
what you're doing that was the whole point of this   no no this is just open forum we're just here well 
I want to know though so um like like I was just   saying I really like to drop value to people i've 
been harassing Jason to do a course by the way if   you're watching you should tell Jason we should do 
a course on marketing or affiliate marketing you   guys should He's like "Oh I don't know paper call 
i don't want to talk about paper call." We don't   need to like let's just do affiliate marketing um 
or marketing or or business or or whatever Jason   so if anyone's watching this harass Jason tell 
him you want me and him to make a course we'll   give that [ __ ] away for free i don't even 
care it doesn't even need need to be money   but I have considered doing a paid course because 
I learned something super valuable about courses   and masterminds years ago and that was from going 
to one i'm not a course junkie like you i I never   thought to buy one um but what I learned from this 
mastermind that I paid to go to and I don't even   do ads anymore was I paid a lot more attention 
when I was there and I I I like really wanted to   connect with people to deliver value um to the 
group and I I made a lot of connections there   i had a great time i'm still really good friends 
with the people that I met there like uh I don't   know if you know Teddy Trung but I I met him there 
and now he's like a a great friend and a customer   and he had never run calls before and we just 
sat next to each other at this mastermind and   vived and next thing you know this guy's winning 
$10 million goat awards months later it was crazy   and um so by spending that money I was mentally 
committed to learning and doing something and so   I did give away the course you watched it i 
think that really motivated people watch it   and do something but the fact that it was free 
devalues the commitment from people and so you   sell information you know a lot about this 
like let's just do a case study right now   if Adam were to make a new course on paper call 
what what do I need to charge for that what is   the strategy around how it's built so then you can 
go market it like walk me through how you would do   it if you were me perfect transition so you saying 
bought bought a course valued it more met people   in it so I made a video about this like I bought 
every guru course and then we did this so when I   exploded that deal out in California I moved back 
to Michigan like tail between my legs and you know   wasn't in debt wasn't whatever it was all just 
time spent but was you know not good my dad has   a big landscape snow company i came back here i 
was you know living in my room my childhood room   basically so not the basement but you know doing 
that and just trying to like figure it out and at   that time was the first time I bought a course 
that I didn't know was a course i didn't know   anything about this industry and bought a course 
on like Instagram shoutouts and they were teaching   to do Instagram shoutouts you make a graphic you 
pay 200 bucks you're on some meme page or whatever   and then uh or like basically non-branded page 
then you that you pay for link in bio teaches you   how to create a lander that is an optin connected 
to I believe it was Aweber at the time they were   shilling and then going through Aweber and the 
thank you page was you literally just set the   redirect as a clickbank link and the idea being 
that it was going to selfquidate and then you just   owned this list and you could just market to them 
and do affiliate stuff and like that is my first   ever course and all that was right there didn't 
really go anywhere with it i did it in women's   fitness which is hilarious now full circle uh did 
it in women's fitness and didn't want to write as   like a fake as like a a fake persona as some like 
female fitness person and like market to this list   so I just stopped doing it and then tried ecom 
stuff messed around was kind just kind of like   working jobs figuring it out and then I bought 
consulting.com which was Sam Ovens i bought his   program the second one so the there there were 
three tranches so into your now let's go deep   into info here so a lot of the time it's these 
ascension style things especially in courses   it's like do-it-yourself done with you done for 
you or mastermind is like kind of like the core   common one so ovens had like the accelerator which 
was a direct to webinar so direct to cart so you'd   sell it through ads directly people could buy it 
on their own that was just a course with group   coaching or not even group coaching with coaching 
calls and then a community it's like course   materials coaching calls community the next one 
up from that was teaching you how once you got all   the acquisition dialed you now couldn't fulfill 
on them all so you need to learn how to productize   your service which was essentially how to become 
a guru and course builder and this was like you   know we we say OG but like obviously he wasn't OG 
of marketing he was like OG of this age this 2016   whatever time frame that was so at this time he's 
doing like 30 million a year too like he's doing   crazy numbers with this he bought consulting.com i 
bought that program very quickly learned I didn't   want to be a face and be the consultant and like 
pick a niche and do that whole thing the I help   X do by X like you know everyone's bio that's 
the classic from him and in that group a guy   posted in there and I was like oh that name looks 
kind of familiar go to his page and three minutes   prior he had posted like hey I have this company 
I will teach you know I'm trying to hire someone   that'll be my like right hand basically I want 
to teach them all things about marketing sales   and whatever online business I'm like okay apply 
for it get on the phone with him thickest thieves   next thing you know 70 million later like so I end 
up joining that company they're running a fit a   women's fitness app it's low ticket doing what was 
likely like was more so like now we're in like the   Brunson age of direct to cart and funnels and all 
that they were trying to run a low ticket app that   was $27 a 7-day free trial with $27 a month and 
then uh Otto of like 1671 147 for lifetime access   and just get those economics to work basically 
breaking even doing like 30K a month and I came   in and I was like building sales pages and like 
tweaking tech and just doing random stuff making   like a thousand bucks every six weeks fast forward 
COVID comes around i don't know if I'm allowed   to say that sorry if we just got everything 
bricked uh but come around to that and then   uh I think that's passed and then um it's X you 
can say whatever you want that's true we can just   write whatever words we want i don't know where 
this doesn't matter i can't even get my trouble on   X and uh true true and um yeah so he's like "How 
should we scale this thing to like 10 million?"   Because like you know we basically have done a 
million bucks in C in like in cash collected on   this low ticket thing but we're like not making 
much money at all like random 1K 2K 5K i'm just   like building pages in tech i'm like "Let's do 
a callunnel." He's like "All right let's do it."   So we buy another course that's like how to set 
up the CRM and everything i buy uh Alex Becker's   course at the time which he was selling like on 
the DL that was really a Trojan horse for Hyros   that was still scaling because he was like 
basically everyone who comes in here pay me   5 grand or 10 grand whatever the number was but 
like you all need to sign up for Hyros because   we need feedback like that kind of system so I get 
in there and that's VSSL script we use we used the   CRM system over this built it around that and we 
had already had a product that was an info product   to sell that was at the time we were selling it 
for $4.97 over the phone which is hilarious on the   economics now because you can't do that like very 
easily and then next thing you know 100k a month   then 300k a month then 500 800 million a month 
doing that for a little bit we're growing the   sales team i became an owner over this time so now 
it's us three owners because the two founders who   built it the expert fitness who's a rockstar and 
then the sales marketing focus guy as we scaled   I went tech ops systems he went marketing sales 
she went product expert and then we changed it   over from info which we increased pricing on but 
we changed it over from info to coaching and so   like annual recurring coaching onetoone with the 
coach and then we went to 3 million a month or 3.7   a month and then our acquisition exploded at the 
end of 24 2024 so that's where we're at now we're   kind of like back in the trenches 1.6 million 
last month not good for us because we have 10   and something employees now we moved everyone W2 
we're like a real business now yeah um so yeah   so a real business yeah a real business now dude 
we got we got an HR director we've got you know   we got Oh don't do that we do we do we need it 
we need it i just don't want to run payroll so   I was doing that for too long but yeah so we 
like built this thing in that way okay and I   always like to say this because it's like I like 
I like don't do well with the zero to one concept   i've never created anything right and like I think 
that's what I really like about lead genen or like   a or these other models where you're like scaling 
something that exists at some level like somebody   built the offer and then you're scaling it right 
or like generating sales for it versus creating   it from zero so like these guys did create it 
from zero he met her in a gym they built it up   they came up with the branding and the name the 
product market fit i came in we changed the model   that we were using and scaled the show of it right 
not we create so they created it I came in helped   scale it beside them and now we have taken it to 
71 almost 72 million in cash collected and our   target is there's two other guys in the space not 
like in the industry style that do over 10 million   a month with this exact model with this info 
coaching model nice so it's like let's do it so   that's the quick info background now the question 
the question is like Yeah well how do you price   it what do you do and how do you sell it yeah and 
then before we move on to that like your target is   what these other people have accomplished but the 
reality is your target should be much bigger than   that because if someone can do $10 million a month 
there's no reason why you can't do half a billion   correct yeah so just be and like you've got the 
other guys out there like there's some there's   some I always like to just road map it like oh if 
they use this model to get to this it's like cool   we can use this model to get to this and then it's 
like new frontier right so like back to that whole   like the framework's there so which obviously you 
are more the zero to one guy you're more in that   realm of like creation and you guys are software 
like mine's like what do you mean I see a model it   works to 10 million it's like run the gambit to 
get to 10 million and then it's like from there   we can see if it can take more or if it needs in 
addition like you know either whether horizontally   or vertically like what is the direction um 
but yeah there are guys in fitness space let's   just say that are doing hundreds of millions a 
year with low ticket a back high ticket backend   and some supplements like yeah the question the 
question you may want to ask yourself if I might   is how do you do 10 times more in onethird of 
the time right like okay my target is 10 million   a month well let's just say that my target is 50 
million a month instead and if I how do I think   about building to that from now and then how 
long is it going to take and then you figure   that out and then you ask yourself how do I do it 
in a third of the time and that thought exercise   will just naturally expand or remove any limiting 
beliefs you have around a milestone like that not   to say that the way you're thinking about it is 
wrong because it's not no no it's just a different   way to think about it i completely it's just a 
thought exercise of expansion and I think a lot of   entrepreneurs get get sort of stuck in their their 
ways and I do too it's it's you know you you're   trying to drive a business and you forget to take 
the step back and dream yeah and when I moved to   Miami a friend of mine a really good friend 
his name is Sam he owns an insurance company   uh called me and I was like in a rough place 
because uh I moved to Miami because my ex of 12   years wanted me to sell Ringba or hire a CEO stop 
traveling for work and I said no um so she left me   uh which was great in retrospect gift and an 
opportunity um but so I land in Miami and I'm   I'm kind of in a rough spot uh emotionally 
and my friend calls me and he checks up on   me regularly but instead he goes like "Hey who's 
your biggest competitor?" And you know I I tell   him for a couple different product lines who who 
that is you know like one's a public company one's   a venturebacked company worth you know uh couple 
billion bucks at this point and he's just like   "Why are you thinking so small?" And in one of the 
most vulnerable times in my life he like attacked   and challenged my my limiting beliefs when I 
wasn't able to defend myself yeah and I was   like "Well what do you what what like what what do 
you mean?" He's like "Who's who's the biggest adte   company that's involved in calls like who's the 
absolute biggest?" And I think about it and I'm   like "Well Google." He's like "Cool so what how do 
you beat them?" And I was like "What?" I I'm gonna   have to think about that and he's like "Yeah stop 
thinking so small." And I was like "Oh fuck." Yeah   like what the hell and what's crazy about that is 
in the next calendar year I more than doubled the   size of the business and added nine figures in 
enterprise value to what we were doing um just   like completely changed my thought process around 
what we're doing more than doubled the size of the   team made a lot of investments they say that they 
say that I'm trying to I think it was like a Dan   Sullivan book I want to say or maybe but like you 
know Cardone's got his whole 10x thing but it's   all like the gist is if you say okay we want to 
increase by 50% this year like list out all the   things we can do and you like have this list of 
like 15 things and then it's like now list out   we want to do 10x list out the things you can do 
and it's like cross out cross out cross out like   to get to 10 times the size you're not going to 
incrementally do this or this or this like you're   fundamentally shifting the belief the action like 
a complete new product line a complete new like   traffic source a complete like just fundamentally 
different and like so when you say that to us   that's instantly where my mind goes because like 
our constraint now if I want to add a zero on   a budget is like you know apps to booking so now 
you have sales team throttling and it's like right   there so like you would need to go direct to cart 
if you're going direct to cart what's the like   economic model that would work on that is it info 
is it subs is it like mid ticket is it what to be   able to do that and then you're capturing LTV with 
the other ones and it's like being able to come up   with that that's an interesting question how would 
we get to 50 million a month or whatever instead   of 10 it's like yeah that's interesting and in 
in our case it's software right and so you can   think about it from your lens which is like oh how 
do I build the offer how do I do this info ecom   yeah my my thought process shifted to something 
different and that is how do I expand the entire   industry pool right like and I was just like uh 
and that's where the book that's where the book   came yeah yeah like uh a lot of the the teaching 
and and I have to get much better at that that's   a crazy idea yeah how do I expand how many people 
are using paper call both on the vendor and on   side on both sides because then you just have if 
you have x percentage of market share you assume   you increase that but you also increase the total 
pie like that's interesting yeah like my thought   process is is how do how do I make every other 
company in the space that sells something like   I do more money yeah because if I grow the 
entire industry right the pool gets bigger   everyone else makes more money and I joke that uh 
I'm the best salesperson for all my competitors i   don't actually think I have competitors right 
like just me i compete against me but um like   that that's like I literally think about myself 
is how do I be the best marketer for everybody   else super interesting because that means that 
the pool has gotten so much bigger what do you   guys do for the other side so like the people who 
are buying more so right like cuz that I feel like   this is more so geared towards like this is where 
the industry is going this is it's expanding it's   going in this like here's how to do it from the 
media buy like kind of more on that side of things   versus like you know how are you what what do 
you guys do for like getting it normalized that   landscapers buy paper you know paper lead instead 
of doing or you just shift the marketers no it's a   it's a whole crazy sort of master plan side of 
that so book number two is about the buy side   it's how do small medium regional and even large 
scale businesses uh take advantage of uh consumer   initiated inbound calls paper call um and there's 
a lot to it and then uh what we also need to do   is we need to make it easy for the smaller scale 
and midsize companies to get their feet wet and to   get involved which is a really hard thing like how 
do you go to I don't know a regional landscaping   company that has 12 locations and services Metro 
Detroit only and get them to buy phone calls   like it's a concept that's foreign to them they 
may not have handle the phone calls and do all   that and then you got this call center yeah 
exactly and so like how do you deal with that   or small insurance offices that type of thing 
and so we realized that the number one question   I get asked at any trade show or any anywhere is 
how do I find more buyers right because a lot of   marketers are not business development people 
they're not um they're not like me right like   they're not going to go to a trade show open up a 
booth bring a sales team and like hustle and and   get customers like that it's just not their 
skill set right like it wasn't mine either i   had to learn it um and so that's why we launched 
Ringba X which is our programmatic call exchange   on the sell side basically any Ringba customer 
only can ping it uh and get a bid for their phone   calls right and so with that we are going to make 
a heavy push into doing the business developments   for these types of verticals to bring the small 
and regional buyers in to create a largecale   national network in every single vertical for not 
like paper call network but just like network of   buyers to cover all of the geographic areas and 
they are basically self-service and um then our   customers can just immediately tap into that and 
there are some other companies in paper call that   do this in home services and some other verticals 
and they basically had a monopoly on the space   um because portion yeah they have like networks of 
small and regional buyers and they take egregious   revshares like 60% 50% they if they can get it 
if they're the only one to doubt it's like yeah   exactly and so like you know I'll just pop to 
it right now on X our average margin presently   is and this is a ballpark this is like 6 to 8% or 
something right like we don't need crazy margin   because we control all of the all the volume right 
like I'm not nearly as concerned about bad traffic   as anyone else because we can see it exactly 
yeah you literally know it's Yeah you see all   the conversion data on it you see the time you see 
everything exactly and you know the vast majority   of the ex participants are um Ringbut customers 
and so we get paid on the telco as well and that's   prepaid basically and so our risk is much lower 
so we don't need to take crazy margins like that   because our core business is software and so we're 
not looking to make our core business this um it's   more of a a way for we can optimize it and do 
the business development for everyone so our   customers can make the most money and it's a it's 
a crazy moat actually for our customers because if   you're not a ring customer you can't sell to it 
just like [ __ ] everybody else i don't care and   it doesn't matter to me that we'll make less money 
that way because I take sides right like that's my   personality my customers are who I serve i mean 
Yeah exactly and you do make you know more not   you know more right like yeah that's interesting 
yeah the the exchange thing is like a ve it's a   very interesting concept they do it in info too a 
lot of the time now that is educationbased but so   you're basically like there's one that's really 
good that's in sales um they have a new one   that's in like female uh sales specific but it's 
basically they like sell to the front so you sell   to the beginner to teach them how to do the zero 
to 10k example and you teach them how to get the   skills and do the thing and then on the back end 
you B2B sell it to you sell the like person with   the skills almost as like recruiting so on the 
back so you get paid two times so your LTV is   like and then generally there's like community 
through it so it's like I teach this person   how to they pay me two grand to learn how to do 
marketing tech or sales they're in my community   i just got paid minus my CPA or whatever and then 
it's a course and then on the back you're selling   them like who needs a marketing tech person 
and then you're selling them for two grand or   five grand or whatever percentage and like you 
just have this like exchange style thing it's   super interesting um yeah I mean depending on how 
hard you want to rip like you said 60% or 2K flat   or whatever it is but well in our case it just it 
just loses money right like the we have a separate   engineering team and a new bisdev team on the 
X side and so the only people making money with   X are customers presently like we our payroll 
on that is millions so um because it's really   complicated technology and we're long-term focused 
like we don't mind making the investment um and so   I think long term it's going to be incredible 
for our customers I just like I just got into   like a public flame war with one uh who doesn't 
like the idea that we're doing this because they   think it'll negatively impact their business and 
I think that that type of mindset is um is really   an impoverished mindset like that's not the way to 
do it the way to do it is to see see someone who's   like "Wow I'm who's built something big and kind 
of crazy right?" And and go like "Okay well how   do I leverage that for my success?" as opposed to 
"Oh my god it it might kill me." And I think it's   hard sometimes for entrepreneurs to move out 
of that paranoia mindset to the like abundance   mindset right yeah 100% and what I have found is 
our largest customers and my my most successful   friends will literally give all their secrets away 
their secrets right because it doesn't matter the   pie is so big that you know people can make a 
ton of money like in paper call you're talking   about I mean we're tracking billions of dollars a 
quarter for Christ sakes and like over a trillion   dollars in commerce happens over the phone every 
year in the United States like how am I going to   stop anyone from making any money like how does 
that even work so um it's really uh an exciting   opportunity i think it's it's super super cool um 
just to see so many people uh be successful i have   a post coming up I'm going to do um like a POV 
one but uh like basically we've helped people make   billions and billions of dollars now and we've 
given away over a billion dollars worth of goat   awards um I see you have your ClickFunnels one 
behind you there which is awesome um I I copied   Russell i'm not going to lie i have all these 
awards in Yeah uh the Miami uh fake penthouse   it's just a I was going to say fake you got to 
make sure everyone knows it's fake yes like the   one I'm in right now is pink by the way this is 
a Zoom back where back background i am not in   the penthouse at the montage in Capalua don't look 
at this but um we we literally covered it in many   versions of of the awards it's such a cool thing 
to see it's a very powerful thing um to see like   the impact it's funny it's like I mean I I love 
those i think they're I think they're super cool   i mean I don't know and how long this one will 
last behind me like we're about to get the third   because each one they're $25 million discs y it's 
like once you get 100 it's like okay and like you   know it was just a fun thing forever because it 
was like oh the million one was on my board you   know my my dream board version which really just 
lives on like a dock or like a Canva image and   then it moved to the 10 and we got that one within 
a year of the other one and then we got that   within a year of the other one and it was like so 
it was just like a cool thing and then would you   say that's hilarious i have the picture of the one 
of you guys bringing onto the jet on my current   one oh wow like because I'm like "Oh yeah no I'm 
for sure moving in the direction of that like at   some point as like a side fun thing." Like I know 
so many people in the space all that it's just I I   love the be I think the beauty of the lead genen 
model is the lean if you do it right obviously   margin different people have different you know 
opinions on that but lean margin the scalability   the no face and like the exit ability like all 
those things in one is like just something you   don't really get in info that you do that you can 
get in e-commerce obviously but like in info it's   not as common um one or two have actually sold 
in info and coaching space like actual info and   coaching of what we're calling it like the guruy 
space um you know Hormosi sold but theirs wasn't   really guruy like it kind of was but it was 
licensing they did a lot of different things   and they did all of the process he has a ton of 
videos about it about how they had to change the   business remove the founder risk like all those 
pieces everything from marketing to product to   whatever in order to do it and like we're in the 
process of that now but at the same time it's like   just business fundamentals we just took a massive 
dive in our break even after doing 30 million in   diving margins because we went from 12 to 30 so 
it's like we have business fundamental things   we need to get to to make sure the profit's there 
like just to sell in general and then founder risk   like we're adding brand faces the product side is 
already out it's all coaches but it's just a lot   of moving parts um with because it's like service 
based but remote it's like remote service based   not just like sell a course not just info money in 
money out and very little fulfillment like so yeah   um there's a lot of layers and the same thing you 
had e-commerce with supplements um so basically   the model we're looking at is info low coaching 
mid to high more coaching like a group style and   then figuring out how to either do partnership or 
self for supplement style for MR so you have like   recurring up here and you have recurring down here 
yeah your back end yeah exactly and just fatten   up the LTV have multiple sources and have like 
consistency and like continuity throughout all   of them and then it is something that could be but 
you know you hear these lead lead genen guys talk   about it and there's you know not to say names but 
you know people who have exited things for 10 and   20 and 50 and whatever that are nice um that are 
nice that are in these lead genen things that I'm   like God and I I joke that that is the biggest 
piece of this puzzle that is like you know it's   kind of like the 8020 it's like get your ads to 
work like everything kind of works which is like   not necessarily true like you need to figure out 
your numbers you need to understand the business   at scale you need to run the people you need to 
operate the thing but like that's the part that   I don't really touch as much like I understand 
what's happening in the ads i understand what's   happening in this but like did I write them did I 
create do the creative did I scale them like no I   didn't like business partner does that part so 
like there's this little like bug in me that's   like I just need to do it myself on something just 
to like feel it just like the a toz portion like   that part of it and it's like yeah it's fun well 
let me I got to go in a minute here i gota go I   got to go feed the Gen Z girls but uh girls well 
look look I I'm from Miami you do whatever you got   to do okay tangent by the way i uh I was handed 
a papaya and told "Have you ever cut one of these   before?" And I said "No." And she grabs her phone 
to go look at a YouTube video and I said "What are   you doing?" I said "Watch this i'm just going to 
grab a knife and we're going to do it." Yeah we're   just going to figure it out real time exact way 
to do it in 30 seconds or less she's like "Well   I don't generally cut fruit." I'm like "Yeah 
I know but I'm old watch this so we're going   to I have a photo i'll maybe I'll I'll tweet it 
it's just like literally me cutting papaya and   putting it into a container the story behind it 
those who know will know the backstory it's just   like you don't even cut your own fruit anymore um 
but what what you talked about there and that's   why that triggered this story is something that 
I have always done and I don't know if a lot of   people do and and that's like at Ringba I don't 
even love my title like I talk to customers all   the time i do customer support i'll I'll do 
anything like it's not you know this is not   my job will get you fired at ring bus straight up 
on the spot and I have done my best I love that   I'm steal oh yeah we don't [ __ ] around that we 
do not [ __ ] around here like you are going to   do whatever is necessary to serve our customers 
and if you will not you are gone like there is   no question about that our mission is to serve 
our customers and that starts with me I go to   all the trade shows I'm at the booth I don't take 
meetings generally So I can just randomly talk to   customers um but my point is is like through my 
entire career I have always spent time doing all   the things so that I understand how they work and 
um you know like at the beginning I did customer   support over live chat like I'll still do it now 
on Christmas I do it so like our team's dude I   have so many we were the first sale like we had 
two people on the team that were taking sales   calls but us three were also on sales calls like 
competing against each other for all the beginning   and like we hired and did those sales things 
this Christmas we I migrated the whole site   from WordPress web flow and built the page and did 
it on Christmas night like solo just sitting here   in the trenches and like everyone's all it was so 
funny but like that had its repercussions uh but   all right man i I really gotta go get some papayas 
and do some things i will post this soon uh when   I get back i appreciate you it was great to meet 
we'll have to hang out cool talk soon bye right

# we made $110,475 yesterday with 3 funnels… here’s how  | E41
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBF2mewatM

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we made $110,475 yesterday using three funnels. And by the end of this video, you are going to know which one of these funnel types to use to scale your business. I'm going to go through what our CMO is calling the value vortex and then break down each one of these funnels, VSSL, DTA, and LT. And we are going to talk expectations, consumption versus friction, economics, and blended economics. All right. Last year we did 30 million cash collected in this business. Everything on the channel is sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing as you can see. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people. All I ask is subscribe if you want to see more, comment some feedback and topic requests, and like the ones you like. So, let's get into it. So, value vortex. I don't know if he came up with this on his own or I'm just saying he coined it. So, this is his phrase. So, shout out to Mo. Uh, he's a rockstar. He's taught us so much in a very short time of being here. with the value vortex essentially which you've seen this if you've seen the other videos on the channel but this is this is the funnel structure of what we're currently running. So I'm going to do a quick overview of this. So this is our main VSSL funnel. So opt-in page to a VSSL VSSL to an application application comes through a router based on quality that'll send them to a booking page or a DQ basically the same. Then it'll go to uh thank you page where they then will get on a call and close. Okay, green one here is new to us. I'm going to break all these down individually and explain how they all talk and what we're testing on each of them and the economics and expectations, but DTA is essentially just running them straight to a page that is headline VSSL application and then directs them to a call after. So, they literally apply on page. There's no opt-in, there's no gated, there's no timer cookie, nothing. Okay? And then red right here is going to be our low ticket funnel. And the low ticket funnel is going to a two-step. So, first page sales page trying to uh basically sell them on it. They put in their name and email, go to the next page to check out. So you get that capture information there. They buy the Otto. We are optimizing for ascension, not AOV. So we are asking them to book a call um which is with a setter. They talk to a setter. Setter puts them on the on the phone with a closer or a sales team member and then they close. Okay, those are three funnels. Now we are calling this the value vortex because basically all these economics blend. So yesterday we did $110,475 stripe to prove it. 15 of those were high ticket buyers, 54 low ticket buyers. So this value vortex is basically like if you look if I I looked at every the journey of every single one of these yesterday and they are touching everything. Everything. They are in low ticket. They're in this. They're talking to a setter or they're talking to a closer only. They are booking direct. They're opting in two months ago. Like it's everywhere. And that's this vortex they're getting seeing us everywhere hitting these different offers and economic ways. So the blended economics I'll break down a little bit later, but the 3% ready is basically saying the people who have gone through this main funnel, which is what we did to to get 70 million so far, by the way. It was all through a high ticket or an opt-in DSL funnel. So 3% ready is saying that only 3% of those are ready to buy or in basically the frame of could purchase. And for us, it's actually 1%. So, we sell 1% of the leads on average that come through here. So, we are leaving an immense amount on the table. Okay. So, the lead to close on this style of funnel for the VSSL, I'm going to go through them each individual on these, but the lead to close on our main is like 20 plus days. Okay. Consumption versus friction. I'm going to break that down between each one of these, but it is huge. There's such a big difference between consumption and friction on all three of these individually, but when they work together, the blended economics are like insanely good. Okay, so let's get into the VSSL funnel first. Yesterday, the VSSL funnel, which is our opt VSSL app. Actually, here I'll break it down here. Opt app booking talk to a closer close. Yesterday, that accounted for 11 of the units. Okay. So, right now what we're doing with this funnel is same as before, but we are testing two different opt-in pages that go to two different VSSLs. So, not uniquely where like opt-in one gets VSSL1. It is going two different optin pages that are the same like messaging or language framing u but different design actually is a big difference on them and then two different VSSLs that are completely two different. Now, this morning, I made this early this morning at like 4 in the morning and then didn't have time to film this, but this is actually off now because we ran this for the last 3 months. And variation two was generating more I'm sorry, less calls and slightly less purchases, which technically means it has a higher sales per booking. But if you just go based on overall sales, which we track in VWO, I have a completely different video for that because if you just looked at the app or the booking, it would show that this won, but this did not win on units over an extended amount of time, like high tens of units, subund, but high tens of units. And the longer one we ran was like 300 and something. So this is the test we're currently running. Now, when we start to talk lead to close and consumption versus friction on this, the friction is high, right? So they have to land here to opt in. So you're going to get call it 20% of people 30% of people that opt in. Then how many are going to actually right are going to make it to this page. How many are going to apply? You're going to assume 20 to 30% are going to apply. Of the people that apply 50% are going to book. Of the people that book 20% or 50% are going to show up on the call. Then of the live calls, 20 is going to close. So that's how you get to like your 1% number. So 100% are opted in, 1% of them purchase. the amount of time, the amount of emails when they land on a VSSL page, they can't instantly apply. Like there's so much forced friction or forced consumption through friction that makes it so they do get on a call more qualified, but your economics can get crazy if you don't have like every step pretty dialed in throughout the funnel. Okay? So, it's kind of like you are restricting the funnel for quality and even then it still like cannot work. like if you have crazy messaging or if you have misalignment or non-ontinuity throughout this like it can break very easily. This is still a very simple fun funnel and I do not mean to say it's not. We did 70 million through this funnel. Um so clearly we like it but we also just like were kind of dumb and didn't do these and didn't do these other ones. So DTA funnel we're going to come back to low ticket funnel. This one is crushing for us. Okay. So, we should have done this a long time ago, but so for the low ticket, we are currently running three different variations on the front. So, three different page designs. Um, essentially, we have like a control was the original one that I actually built, which is hilarious. Um, or like designed and wrote and stuff. And then our copywriter came in and changed some copy, not to take credit. Um, two and three were like complete groundup beautiful designs. One is dark, one is light. So, basically, it's just a design difference, but like vastly different from the first one. All of them are uh headline VSSL crazy copy like the beautiful pages you see this is like ugly as can be but headline VSSL bunch of copy two-step these checkouts just clean versions of checkouts these just clean versions of bookings but all of them are in alignment so these do not split between these these split one way so it is a one directional now this one is by let me think this one or this one yeah this one this one is like dominating um so it's winning by a long shot. So this will be crown to win which will give the entire thing 20 30 50% increase. The setter to or I'm sorry the purchase to booking rate is insanity right now. It's like 75%. Of people that purchase so if you get 100 buyers in a day which we got not we got 54 but of those 54 we're getting like 30 or 40 of them to book an implementation call or whatever a framework call whatever you want to call it like your starter call with a setter. and it's like 75% of them are booking with a setter. Then from a setter they go to a closer and that's a x whatever percent set rate call it 30 call it 50 whatever I don't have an exact number off the top I can do another video on the data of this a little bit deeper and then talking to a closer now the show rates for the set to close so the ones that a setter talked to on their call then they booked in there is like 75% now and I made another video it was like 72% it's like 75% and the live call close is like 16 or 17 and inching towards like the prior days are going like this and the earlier days are the lowering the average. So this is crushing. Okay, so up here what did I say? Three of these units came in from yesterday. Two of them came through implementation. So what that means is that three of these units started here. They came into our value vortex or our uh ecosystem, our sphere of whatever that they came into. They sourced from here. Okay. Okay, so they saw an ad, they bought this. Two of them were imps, which I would just mean is like these setter calls. We're calling them implementation calls. So, two of them booked in here, talked to a setter, then booked, then got set with a closer and then bought. One of them never booked that call, bought this a month ago, and then was inside the product and inside the product portal has a CTA in there andor saw ads. I could look at a little deeper and actually give you an examp uh so they either saw the portal or they saw an ad in there and then booked a call through that. So this is just going back to like the blended economics of this the time two on this on average those uh setter ones are two days because they're coming in they're setting then they're set getting with the closer uh setters are trying to put it on the closer calendar for same day if not next day if not next day they get to go out three days our main booking widget only goes out two days or 48 hours or 30 uh yeah 48 hours or 72 hours right um so yeah so this is crushing but it has a lower time to close than something like this, which is very interesting. Now, we've also been running this way, way way shorter amount of time. So, I could not tell you the average might skew out, which is good because right now we're hitting our ascension numbers on prior 30, but like over 90, over 180, like we have no idea how many people that are inside this of the hundred that buy, call it four that are buying the backend program, that could go up to eight from that same period of buyers. But like, we don't know because now they're in the value vortex. are in our ecosystem and we got paid to do it or we paid less to do it than we did in this model. Okay, so the economics are vastly different. Right here we make no money. Right here we do make money. Now DTA, I'm praying that this is ours. This is this is the one. So DTA, this is what everybody runs. And for whatever reason, we just had this ego or like viewpoint on consumption and friction and if they come through here, they're warmer and like all this kind of stuff. And honestly, it's already proven to be true, but that does not mean that we're not going to make it work. So, what a DTA funnel is headline VSSL application where generally speaking, the uh button is right there for them to click, open a pop-up, and apply. Okay. There are people who remove the button until the CTA hits in the VSSL. That would add more friction, right? because somebody would land on it, they're in the car or whatever, they're doing something and they would have to watch the video through before they would even be allowed to apply, right? So, you're adding friction, which you would assume means that they've consume the VSSL longer and they have more consumption, more context. You would assume that not necessarily always true, but that's what that is. Okay? So, they're going to go watch VSSL headline. So, right now, we are testing this. We are testing three of these. Okay? all with the same headline, three different VSSLs, everything else on page the same. Same thing, different application technically, but like framed in a better way for DTA that is then routing them through and coming. So I actually mess this up a little bit because it's really like this. They are still going into a router and going to DQ versus quality based on financial qualifier and routing through here. Okay, yesterday app to booking to closer call to client, we had two of the units here. Okay. So, in total yesterday, did I say 15 or 16? 15. Is this 15 or 16? 16. That means this was 10 because I did math backwards. I pulled these two because I knew they were lower. My bad. Um, 10 units, two units, three units. But yeah, so the DTA for us, the idea here, we've had so many of these calls already come through though, like 80 plus of these calls and we have closed three in total. Two yesterday, one the day prior, but it's brand new. And then also during that time, we broke our automations, we broke our Zoom, and it was ramping for the first time, and everything was breaking. So it's like, can you use the early data? Unlikely. Now, here are the three. So you've got your VSSL, you've got your DTA. I'm a huge believer in this. I think that we should have been doing this longer. If you can crack it, the economics on this are insanity because you are getting them straight through here. Like our cost per booking on this is I I don't even want to say how low it is. Like it is crushing crushing. But their level of consumption is lower. Their buyin is lower. They have not gone through an opt-in, been forced to watch a VSSL, get emails from you, then do this, then do this, then do this. like they just it's it assume you're going to assume it is less quality. Assume that it's less and that they don't know who you are and that they're not going to pay 10 grand or five grand or whatever over the phone as easily. Now, there's a million things that happen here with emails and ads and stuff that you can do to like warm them up pre- call. And the first time you collect information from them on this is an application, not a booking page or I'm sorry, application, not a lead. So up here, I get to email this person 50 times before they get to apply. They get to go on our website. They get to like click around. are they ready yet? And when they're ready, they apply. Here, it's like if you don't apply, you lose them. And there are tools, I'm going on tangent here, but there are tools that you can use that capture the email that'll then you can use for email marketing, but it's kind of like gray area. Um, and we've used it before and it like didn't back out for us. It did on open rates, but not on close rates. And sorry, tangent over. But so now how all these are working together. DTA and this are running main and load. Okay, so all three of these are running their own traffic. That's what these boxes are. Then they're all coming together and technically speaking using the same booking page and the same success page. These we just swapped out for beautiful design and got a 10% lift across those just by making them cleaner because I built them CEO built them and they were ugly and we were just moving things over and it worked for 70 million but we wanted to be branded and conversion optimized now. So these are now built rebuilt and are performing better. Sales team is on one right now and setters claimed something like 200 and whatever bookings over the last seven days which before was zero because we did not have a setter team. So all of those working together came out to 15 units yesterday there 54 on low ticket. Now final piece of this lead to close. I cannot accurately give you lead to close on these two until it extends. I can definitely give it to you on this because I've ran it for four or five years and it has changed slightly as we've added things and you know now that setters are in there it is actually decreasing a little bit because they talk to a human instead of just how much how many emails, how many clicks, how many whatever. This one is very interesting and this one is like the most interesting. This one could just come out of left field and completely break the economics. I would recommend somebody who is starting. This is going to be easier to build. I don't want to say harder to nail. It's almost like it has like a bigger room for error. Like the cost per call is so low. The friction to allow somebody to apply for you to to work with you or for your program or for your whatever is low. So using this I would say is probably the best bet. Um and then you can determine from there what do you need to add for pre-objections? What do you need to like? You can determine from there. This I personally think this is harder to run a low ticket. Like I see people talk all the time about how it has like the economics work better. Just drop the price like crazy. Just see what the different messaging is and like match it. So like to build a full sales page and a full checkout flow and like a product on the back end and like all this other stuff and deliverables and and all of that to test something and to try and figure out like what the messaging is or what it like I just don't think this is necessarily the easiest way in comparison to this this which is also why I say that I think people should be doing sales calls or higher ticket if you're talking about low ticket and all this other stuff like I only know what I know. This is like completely my opinion and does not matter to anyone. So with a grain of salt, but I think this is much easier because you get to talk to the person. You get to understand who the people are that your messaging is attracting. Is that the right messaging? And then is that in alignment with what the product or the the problem you are solving and what your service or product is, right? Like this one I think is the biggest for feedback loop. So like earliest I think this one is best for scaling once you have all the other pieces in place because of the economics. And I think this is just tried and true. Like if you nail this, you nail like it rocks because you can clean up and you have way more emails. You have way more assets that you're collecting throughout it versus this. And then this is just harder to you just have to do so much volume depending on on your ascension rates. But you have to do so much volume to make it meaningful in the back. Like if I was selling a hundred of these a day, you would assume you're getting four that are backing out and not even on same day, like into the future. And that's that's the thing I'm saying about the time to close is unknown yet. Um, but call it a week or two weeks. Like you're selling a hundred of them a day. You're liquidating however however much you can. If you can do like I've heard of guys in the internet marketing space that are liquidating like two and three on this. So like they're making two to three times rorowaz on the front end before it even gets on the phone with a setter closer. and then buys a high ticket. So like all the power to you, but like if you're losing money on this, how hard do you want to scale it knowing that if you're selling a hundred a day, you're only going to get four that back out and you don't know when. So it's like you're kind of bleeding. There's a trough is what I'm basically saying. There's a cash trough where people are like in no man's land, but you have setters that you're paying for. You have closers that are commission only, but still they need volume. So you have to ramp it up. So you have to have spend. And it's just like I think this one works best for economics. I think this one works best for like testing, iterating, talking to people and getting a gauge of things. And I think this is just like tried and true still what we will run. You just really have to nail the messaging. And I think we may have like overused ours or spent into it too much to the point where really it's just kind of getting like lasting effects because like if I look at these people who came in, there's a chunk of them that were 30 days or more than 30 days. There was a chunk of them that were like two days. Like it's crazy on the time to lead. It's just like or I'm sorry, time to close from lead to close. Um, so yeah. So, I hope that was helpful. Um, I like this one and this is what like all the guys talk about like Jeremy Haynes has a ton of videos. This is basically the main funnel they run. He does talk about all these other ones obviously like they run everything but like this is a very common one. Um, and yeah, so that's that. Yesterday 15 day before or I'm sorry, uh, 54 low ticket. We're scaling that back up again. I hit 2500 subs. I am back in the cave. So, bought a new laptop. says it's gonna take like forever to get here because I customized the out of it. And www.ryclog.comdoc. Use the ww because I broke some on ClickFunnels and I don't care and I don't want to fix it. And you will get all of the videos and what their main idea is and then the different categories. Everything I talk about is marketing, tech, ops, sales, and I've been doing them every day for 41 days. All right, comment, subscribe, like this if you got any value. Give me some feedback.

# we lost MILLIONS using marketing agencies.. here's how. | E40
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or_1vFKchRM

In today's video, we're going to be talking about how we lost millions of dollars using marketing agencies versus building an in-house team, and how you can avoid doing the same. I'm going to go through the different agency specialties that we've hired, the different pay types we've used, the org changes that happened in our marketing department from when we were doing 30K a month all the way up to 3 million a month, and then I'm going to go through the out then approach, which I believe is the best for agencies and contractors. If you stick around to the end, I've been making these videos for 40 days in a row. Uh, every day I share what we did yesterday. Yesterday was Easter, so a bad day for us, and I'll explain why. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our info coaching business. All I share on this channel is what did work, didn't work, actively doing, trying to find top talent, opportunity, and network of cool people doing the same. All I ask, subscribe, comment, topic, ideas, feedback you have, like the ones you like, leave the other ones alone. All right, so let's get into it. Agency specialties. There are 92 other variations of these. I am just going to share what we have used. So, we have used media buying specific. So your meta only, your Google only, your combined, right? So someone who handles both. We have hired creative only agencies that'll just do um creative for paid. We've also done some uh agencies that have done creative for organic. But again, like not what I'm talking here. Everything I'm going to be talking here is going to be what we've actually used in the marketing side of the business. That for us is 95% paid for acquisition. Okay? And again, there are 92 other variants to this. There are people that do podcast specific. There are people that do tech specific. There are like there's a million different types. I'm just sharing what we've done. Pay types, retainers, your 10k a month and that's it. Your retainer plus spend percentage. Someone's going to charge 10% on their as a fee plus a retainer to cover their overhead. Basically retainer plus rorowaz percentage. Getting a little closer to really what as a business owner you see right as the rorowaz percentage just result based. Not how much they spend on volume but closer to what is their return. They get a percentage of what they return. Row has percentage flat. As a business owner, this one is actually kind of back and forth because as a business owner, it's like great. It's like they just get a piece of what they grow. So they're spending $10,000 and they're getting back 50,000. They get a percentage of the spread there. So on that 40k, they'll get whatever 10% 30% like there's all these different variations. People have different higher pieces. And that's also back to this agency specialty. depending on how far they lean into the bucket. There are people who will do all your scripting for VSSLs. They will do like page copy. They will change out a ton of stuff versus just doing your media buying or just creating ads for you like actual creative. Even the creative ones, do they make the scripts and do the editing and then all you're doing is the filming? Do they just do the editing? Do they just repurpose stuff? Like there's a million ways that this is cut and sliced. So, I'm just kind of giving some examples. Spend percentage. This one is extremely common. um extremely extremely common um at least that we've seen. So don't take that for grain of salt. Um 92 mixes and variations of these. Some people will do splits of these. Some will do uh all cash. Uh some will do only new cash minus like things. Some will do the liquidation amount of your low ticket. Like it is literally everything in in between. And let's get into the or changes and then I'm going to back into how all of these have worked for us. So, initially it was us, big dog Luke, me, we're going to call me CTO, we're going to call him CEO, when really we were just two people with laptops. He is very, very good at marketing, messaging, and media buying. Um, he had done stuff like this prior, just kind of like drop shippy, ecom style, as well as just some other and he's really good in sales. So, as the company has expanded, I've explained this in other videos, but he got more into a place of marketing and sales. I went tech ops systems as we scaled but we have this direct overview connection of all things marketing ops and strategy that we still do together. So back in the day we're posted up in Bali sitting there on laptops and I was making Photoshop images and he was running ads and writing copy and critiquing the images and going back in this feedback loop. And then third over here is the actual expert in brand face. They started it. I came along after the fact and met them there. Okay, in person I was already working with them before then. The next evolution of that was we had a copywriter join the team. This was very very big for us because at the time we were writing a lot of emails. Um and to this day you'll see him carry out throughout this. This is the same copywriter we've had. Luke knew him through personal connection from like when from going to school together actually back in the day. He has evolved and we like joke that he has a better brand voice or he is like a dupe of our expert. Like he can write the same way she can. And he writes two emails a day for us. He writes scripts that are still our winners for our VSSLs even though we've hired it out. I'll get into that. And um yeah, so he's a rockstar, but so he joined the team there. And then what really kind of happened next was a creative. This guy is a superstar. He was amazing. Like to the point that he was kind of asking like how to take on other clients and do other stuff while he was full with us. Um he was already doing work before us as a contractor. Came on with us as a contractor and crushed it. Like some of the top VSSL edits. He could do anything. He could edit ads. He could edit organic. He could edit VSSLs and he could do everything to the point that when where does he drop off here? I'll get to that later. But um I don't know why I put process here. This is Google. Sorry about that. So the next phase was getting Luke out of media buying. So he got out of meta and we had a meta media buyer come in. We sold the creative. We sold the copywriter. All of these ranges were scaling the info product. were somewhere around a million um is still hands-on very much so. But at this point, we have no agencies. Okay, so that's the important part here. We have no agencies throughout this. This is all either contractor, contractor, contractor-ish, but like in-house and then contractor. Okay. Now, in between these phases, I was doing the Google media buying back to the courses and all of that. uh me and the CEO met inside of consulting.com group and I have always been plugged buying courses in the communities and is where we have found people over and over and over again to join the team. That is also the goal of why I do this is because when we do want to grow into spaces and do things I want to learn and I want to be able to find talent and be able to find media buyers. It's already happening on X. It's already happening in all these places for future opportunities or this business specific. Okay. So, I bought a course and this was actually not even mainly on YouTube at the time. This was all about or I'm sorry, Google, this was all about YouTube. So, we had never cracked YouTube at the time. It was hot. It was how can you crack it for a VSSL callunnel? Doing the lead uh or optimizing in through that, which instead of it just being brand, we had it up and running. We're spending three to five grand. I was buying for it actually at the time. Um I've never bought for Facebook for this specific. I bought a lot for Facebook um but never beyond like 5k in scale. These guys are spending you know 2030 a day for the last years years and years and years uh for this and other things. So I was running media then we got this then we got a media buyer then we got a Google media buyer. These are outsourced and they were running YouTube and branded search for Google nothing cold on search. Okay next phase agencies. So, the next phase, and this is when we were at about the hard part of this is explaining how we had so many things going on at the same time. And I'm going to say this over and over again once I get into this phase is like I'm not blaming an agency for why it didn't work. I'm not blaming I'm not blaming anyone. I'm not blaming us. I'm not blaming them. I'm like I mean actually that's not true. I'm taking blame. But it just wasn't the timing was and there was a lot of momentum in a lot of ways. same way that we say that in sales like we were crushing at a specific time because of a lot of other circumstances as well as sales. But like when you start to get into kind of the thicker times it's like you the the a shines through it is much easier to see where it's falling apart and where the systems are falling apart versus where everything is just in momentum climbing at the same time or falling at the same time. Right? So at this phase I am doing page builds and tech and all of that around it. So all the tracking for all of this, all of the page builds, anything that they're launching for that. But we kind of slowed down on that because we had one main core funnel. Go to the videos on the page. I have a video that's like the three offers that we use to get to 70 million. That's an example of where you can see the funnels. But we basically were running a VSSL call funnel only at this time. So we brought in a media agency. Now, how were these guys structured? So first off, these guys were flat. Okay? So when we were bringing these guys in, these two were experienced but not in our space, which ended up being a big issue over time. So that's why we moved to this right here is because this one was uh a superstar media buyer but for lead genen more. So we're spending like three 400 grand a day just not in our industry because you don't spend that in info and coaching really. They were doing like direct lead to this was not just a kind of a great fit. I don't even know why the box is so big. um not a great fit overall and yeah just wasn't a superstar. So that's why we decided to transition out of these guys is because we weren't getting the results we wanted. Now next we got a hybrid style agency. So these guys were doing Google and meta for us and we still had our superstar creative. Now they were still doing some creative. They were still doing some scripting and these guys were more of like the overall like let me look at the whole funnel. Let me kind of change this up and that at this time these guys and I have a data sheet over here. So, don't mind me looking is when we scaled up to our biggest months, which was right here. And CPA was pretty much on lock for the first couple months as we scaled aggressively into it. And then CPA started going crazy and just started climbing, climbing, climbing. Then it dropped a month, then it was climbing, climbing. And I don't want to blame them necessarily. So, their pay structure that they had with us was a cool hybrid of like the spread between. So, it was a retainer amount monthly or it's basically an upfront retainer amount that would cover them just doing it and they're like, "If we can't get you results, like you get the money back." And then from then on, it was a percentage of like a rorowaz metric. So, like how much new rev minus how much spend and then a percentage of kind of the spread the uh spread on there, which I like, right? It's like it's result based. If they're not getting results, it's not going to work. Now, again, there are multiple things that are happening in the background to make it if that works or not. Um, including the sales team, including different pieces of the like just different pieces of the puzzle. the offer structure that we were changing. There's just a lot of different things that can affect that, but we're all in the same ship. We're all targeting rorowaz profit, all those things. Okay, so that was this phase right here. And sorry if this is kind of like all over the place. I'm trying to piece and part this together in my brain uh while I actively do this. I flew back and took a red eye and I'm trying to rip this video for you guys. So, next phase from there, it was not working over time. We actually got rid of them. We brought back these guys for a brief minute. Then that was kind of weird. Then we consulted with this guy and we were kind of in dire situation. It's not backing out, but we can kind of run it on our own, but we don't want to be running it. And that's where it kind of came down to like we don't want to spend the time and the energy and like the detail orientation to do it. Um, specifically CEO who was the media buyer in and out of there. So, we were like, "All right, let's find someone else." We think the issue is we're just ramming all this spend through like a couple ads. We don't have steady mass like creative production and this is in kind of the era of everyone being like oh it's all creative it's all creative which again it is a lot of the way I mean it is all creative but this was like mass ecom style like crazy split testing of ads and we jumped to this model so we hired these guys and we're like oh cool hands off they run everything so I wrote creative here but this is like that example of the mix or the both they were running Google Facebook within Google YouTube. Um, and then yeah, so like all meta and then YouTube cold and then all of our Google as well and they were doing crazy things and like again this is no on them because they crush it and they have huge clients and they like do really well and a lot of them are in ecom. Some were in info but again they had different acquisition models than us at the time. Not just VSSL funnels. They were running low uh they were running um low ticket ascension. They were running um webinar style. They were just running a bunch of different models that at the time, and this is where it's like our problem and our fault, we pass it off to these guys and then we're like, "Oh, cool. Now to scale it, not like, oh, how can we then work on the back end and create different offers for them to media buy and do creative for that will back out better in an economics way." And that was 100% on us. They had mentioned it a couple times. I tried to launch a low ticket all myself, which is crazy behavior because I don't do that kind of stuff. I built one. We tested it. Someone else ran it in a separate ad account. We looked at it 10 days later, didn't look good. Turned it off. A month and a half, came a month and a half later, came back to it. It had backed out like six units and was like crazy profitable. Tried to turn it back on. Like just not it was this was a very messy period for us. And this is around when we started to tank down from when we were at 3 point whatever a month, 3.7 a month. Um we just started just like throttling down to like 2.2, 2, 1.5, 1.7, whatever the range was. Then we had some stuff throughout fall through Q4, 2024. And then we got rid of these guys at the end of Q4, I believe, almost end of Q4. Then at that time is when we built out this new structure of what we're currently operating on that I believe is going to be the next phase and stage of this. But basically 30k a monthish, 500ish to a million and then one to 3.5 millionish in these ranges, but CPA was sliding like crazy. So when I talk about how the margin just got attacked and eaten and eaten up, that was because of all of this. It was because of agency. It was because of model. It was because it w we just didn't have a handle on it. And it was like 100% on us. And again, great agencies. They clearly like run and have great results for people. It was just a combination of us and the timing. Now, one thing I do want to touch on, this was a percentage of spend and that's it. And I don't know why we agreed to it and we did. It had nothing to do with rorowaz whatsoever. So, at that time, we were ramping like hard. Like we were spending a million bucks a month like easy and paying like I think it was like 12% 13 like we were paying 130 G's to have media buyers and creative a month while losing money or while the CPA was climbing. So it's like we are burning money on acquisition. We're burning money on agency and everywhere else you can imagine all like just trying to figure this out. We're hiring people and this is just marketing. It's like imagine what we're doing on this other side. Like it was real pain like real growth pains. Um and that all happened around here. So, here's our new model. We didn't have the CMO in here yet. So, uh this is kind of like a multi-phase thing. We got a creative director to come in because we're like, we need creative. That's the number one thing. Uh came in to do paid. Now, basically handles organic and paid. Um they have an editor under them. Um these she's a rock star. Um and she came over from like a really really reputable place. Uh which is great. And she was working direct with CEO. He was still doing media buying. Then we brought in a media buyer and his like junior that's with him. Uh these are contractors. These are employees contractor uh contractor contractor side gig. So Google siko that we had come in media buyer and junior media buyer these are both like really really well-known people in the info and coaching space and they run a lot of other stuff. So there's a lot of similarities in VSSL funnels and ascension and all that. These are very well-known people. These guys do retainer that kind of like climb a little bit. um copywriter fixed creative director salary in with clims editor uh is like a output amount basically and then page builder this guy is a sicko I love him he's hilarious uh and he's a contractor and he runs all of our uh or he runs a ton of other people in info coaching space like every name you've heard of uh he has built a funnel for them at one point and it's beautiful and he is doing all those things for us uh and then we just brought on the CMO to actually run this ship basically saying we did this in the past we broke it we need somebody who can actually lead this department and team. We are so much direct response. We are so heavy in all this stuff. It is such a pivotal portion of the company in terms of profit growth stinging things like stable and that is now our current team. So he overlooks all of these. We work with him in tandem. I'm over here still. I don't have to do the actual page builds anymore, but I still do all the tech connections and automations, the application splits, the tracking. Like I still build all those out. Um because my tech team focuses on more backend automation, connection, sales stuff, and I still do almost all the marketing tech. I want to get out of that, but that is the structure. Okay, so quick recap. That was the app and a half. How can I quick recap this for you? Retainer versus ROAZ. There is a spread where it can be made. As an example, if we had a copywriter that's a retainer, if you there there's technically a point where like you are making so much back from them in ROI that a retainer does make more sense for you. But a lot of the time the retainers are higher and rorowaz is more guaranteed like you have to they have to make you money for you to make money like performance model. Um so I do like these more. But now let's get into big dog horos. I'm going to butcher this. Go watch his stuff. It's 500 times better than me. He has 500 times more experience and has 500 probably more than 500 times more money. Um, but his idea around contractors and how to approach this is basically hire the pros that are contract or I'm sorry that are agencies or contractors, hire the pros, prove the model, the ROI, the KPI on whatever thing you're doing. So if it's podcasting, if it's YouTube, if it's Facebook, if it's whatever, hire them out. Then you're paying them 30 grand a month or something. At the same time, you're learning from them. You're seeing how they do it. You're asking them to show you show them how show you how they do it. You're and then building an in-house team in tandem and asking them basically to consult and building your in-house team up until they can beat them or operate at the same level at them because now you have more control. They're in-house. They likely can be better and more suited to you. And the thing with agencies is, you know, they are at some level spread thin because they have other clients. Um so yeah, there's a ton of really really good agencies out there. Um you can message me. I have some really good ones I'm friends with that do a mix of all these. Um, and then there's a couple guys that are like growth marketers that are also agencies um that really really crush it. So, this is not a on marketing agencies. This is a our structure story and how we did it and how we literally lost millions in cash paid out uh that was not directly returned from the efforts as well as oh my god tens of millions in opportunity cost of us tanking down into these trenches where we're at. And that was because of the marketing agencies. Not really. It was because of how we had the model plus the marketing agency plus the cap structure, how we or the the pay structure of how we paid them and all the mix of that. So that's that. That's the overview. Yesterday's stats. It was Easter. What did I tell you? I told you the day before we did 84,000 and then it wasn't good because then we're going to do 10 or 20 G's and it was going to just average out. It was Easter, which I understand and respect and happy holidays or happy Easter to anyone who celebrates. But three high ticket buyers, 45 low ticket, which was only 20 G's. Not good. But as expected, that's the thing with call funnels when you can only accept money over the phone. Uh like at scale, no one works on those days either on the employee side and no one wants to book a call on those days. So you have low days and you need to account for that in your averages across the month. So that's that 45 low ticket. These are backing out really, really well. I have some fun updates and today is off to the races. Hopefully I have an exciting video for you tomorrow, but I am back in my dungeon and I will be sitting here and until I hit 2500 subscribers so I can buy a new laptop. So ryanclog.com, you have to use the www because I broke something on ClickFunnels and I don't care to fix it for all these videos. I broke them down into tech, ops, marketing, like sales, the different things, and then gave you the main idea because I have someone in there doing title changes and thumbnails. But check them out. You guys rock. I appreciate all the support you guys are giving me on these. It actually does mean a lot. I thought 10 people were going to watch and like 300 are watching, which is huge. So, let me know if you guys have any questions or some topic requests. Um, they're on that dock, right on the uh right on top of that dock. So talk soon.

# Made $85k yesterday but feel like sh*t. | E39
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDpHXwLtYd8

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing how we did $84,657 yesterday in our info coaching business and why that is not good. I'm going to go through the funnels we're currently running, which are different than before, what is working for us, what is not working for us, and some new new that we are launching into next week. Last year, we did 30 million cash collected in that same business. And I'm sharing on this channel what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing, as I'm doing today. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. And if the video lags for you during this, it's because you did not subscribe, comment, or like. All right, let's get into it. So, funnels we're running VSSL1 splits galore, low ticket one, splits galore, and DTA1 splits galore. All right, so let's walk through them. VSSL1. I go into these in crazy depth on the channel talking about these, but so essentially the first is the main this is how we did 70 the first 70 million is all through opt-in VSSL app, book a call, technically routing if they're DQed or not, but just for the general gist, get on a sales call, close. Okay, low ticket. In connection with this, we technically do route them if they are DQed and our calendars are full to low ticket, but we are running this direct right here as a low ticket ascension model focus. Okay, not an AOV focus. Uh, not a front-end profitable focus. The goal is to get them I mean, obviously you want to get as profitable as you can on the front end or as break even as you can. Um, but for us right now, the goal is to get them on the on the phone with the setter and then get them on the phone with the closer and then close them. Okay? So, I'm going to go through some of those stats. And the new one we are launching. This is one you're going to see everywhere. Jeremy Haynes, again, shout out him. I watch all his stuff. It's great. Um, he talks about this a lot, but basically DTA direct to app. You can call it direct to VSSL. It's going to be ads to a page that is a headline, um, a VSSL and then a apply button and then sometimes testimonials and stuff, but essentially they can just apply direct there. So, no gated for the opt-in and then sometimes even making it so the application or the button to do that is available immediately. Some people do it after the CTA in the VSSL. Okay, we are testing it with the uh application available right there. So those are three splits on these. We're doing opt-in splits on the VSSL to do so like the very front end right here. We are doing low ticket splits like galore. I don't I can't even go into that, but we're doing all types of stuff here to try and keep the net CPA on that low and try and find like a steady state zone so we can scale into it because that's the biggest thing uh on this. And then the DTA we're just testing and technically we're testing three different with three different VSSLs and three different headlines because we've never run this before directly and this could be huge for us uh because we've never run this and we are thinking maybe we've been missing out and I will be both excited and annoyed if this works for us really well because we didn't do it for the last 70. We didn't do this direct and we also didn't do setters for the last 70 million. So whoops. So what is working for us now? Also this is going to be a quicker video. Uh I'm still traveling. Sorry about the noise. If the video glitches, it's because I'm not at 2500 subscribers and I don't have a new laptop yet as my funny reward. What is working? Cost per app and booking and then how that equals out to volume. So, we're running it through here. I mean, technically, it's coming through all of them. The bookings and the apps are coming direct here and direct here. The low ticket technically does not have an application because it goes through a setter. They do have like a setter app on the end just to get more information for the person, but the math is working. So, our costs in example, these are examples. If we're spending 10 grand a day, you have $500 call uh qualified call, $500 cost per qualified call, you're only getting 20. Spend the same amount of money. Very simple math here, but if you get them for $100, you get 100, right? So, this is allowing us to fill calendars uh without needing to spend more. Obviously, again, but like for a long time, sometimes that hasn't been the case. And we want to kept volume. want to keep volume for the sales team um almost at the detriment of portions of the company or profit of the company because we're trying to fill calendars. So this is really good for us to be matching the volume uh with the open spots, the availabilities and the volume. Okay, branded search for a long time this absolutely crushed for us and we had like an adex rorowaz branded search is basically for people who don't know real quick is like just your brand name keywords. So company name, uh expert name, company name reviews, any phrase match anything and then sending them back to somewhere. Some people send it to the opt-in. I'm not a fan of that. I don't believe in that. Uh some people send it to your low ticket or other offerings. I also don't believe in that. Uh especially when you're running a call funnel at scale. My thought is that it should go to more consumption. Um basically meaning like so consumption, testimonials, I think I'm glitching. Sorry. Um testimonials or the main homepage, how it works, stuff like that. just because somebody who has booked a call is then looking you up or someone right before a call is looking you up and to then put them in front of a gated thing where they need to opt in again or try to sell them something that's low ticket when you really want them for your high ticket is what it is. So for us, we they tried these inbetweens and it wasn't working and I didn't think it was going to work properly and then now it is working thankfully and we were back in like the six range I believe rorowaz which this should just be like a 30 rorowaz or whatever 10 row. So it's in the right direction but it was like not working for us for a long time. So this is a win. Google AI this is crazy  and I don't even know a lot of people don't know like how this is working. So when someone searches something Google now does its like AI answer for it. Ours will show like the program's 25 grand, the program's $30, the program's $29 a month. Like it'll just pull stuff from everywhere. It'll pull Reddit reviews of like it's a 16week program that's four grand for this and this, which is like you look at the Reddit review or the Reddit thread and it has nothing to do with us. So, I think we cleaned this finally. There's like a constant battle, but right now it's finally saying like, oh, you have to book and it's unique to you and it's custom and like go here and you can book a call. Everywhere I look, it's different, but like this is a win because I think we're understanding this. we got certain things taken down that were just are removed that were not relevant to us that were not about our brand or about us or factual information like 20k or 50 whatever the numbers. So this was a win and then also then helps with branded search and helps all those other things because it takes the clicks in that direction. They kind of like play one in one the ascension. So this is working really well for us. Um we had some pixel issues and I'll get into that in this but I hate that I'm talking about pixels and like showing how we do it and then like they don't work for us but like that's life in the trenches. Um the ascension on this is working really well. So that is a mix of the setters. It's a so the good net CPA is what we need to max in or lock in on before we can do more volume on this and then going into the setters is crushing. We need more data around this. I'll get into that too. And then going to the sales call, but the ascension rate is there. Okay. And like working really well for us, which is great because we should have done this years ago and we didn't. And I'm excited that it's now there. Um show rates, lol, because I'll get into that not working. But show rates after the updates we made, I made a whole video on this you can go back and check, but our show rates were humming in the 60Ds, like mid60s. Um, with our setter ones being as high as 7580 on day. Uh, and that's still with them kind of like ramping and getting into it. So, I think it's very good. And then setters, they're just crushing it. So, we got an Abon director. First time we've actually hired one, like a good one. It's not true. We did hire one that then didn't quit his other job and then stayed with us and we were both paying him salaries and things and like it didn't work. So, we were jaded. So for the first 70 million we say we did not have setters when we did have one for like two months that didn't really do anything. Oops. But um yeah so our new outbound director is a sicko. He is crushing it. Uh he is like an entrepreneur within it. Like he's doing very very well for us and yeah there's a lot of opportunity as he can see and he's crushing it. The numbers are there. What's not working? CPA which is important. So here I am talking about how our cost per app and booking is solid but the percentage of what's backing out. A CPA is better. Let me say that first of all because it was not good. It was very bad for like a minute there. Like very bad. Now it is like manageable but still not target which is okay. Um and can we can run with that but like again we did 85 grand yesterday which is like okay but I'm like it's not good for two reasons. One because the CPA still is not in alignment. So the cost to that is not great. Um it's fine again but it's not great. And then the other is today's Easter which is kind of just like I'm joking. Happy Easter to anyone who celebrates. But today's Easter, which means today we're going to do like 10 grand because like no one's going to buy. Very, very limited. People are going to book. There's super low calls. We're maxed out through today already into tomorrow, which is good, but like the volumes. So, we're going to do very little today. So, if you average that across the two days, it's, you know, 40 grand, 50 grand or something like that across two days, which is like not good. So, kind of a joke there. It is good that we did this yesterday, but if you average it and where we've been for the month, still not where we need to be. Okay. CPA, Zoom, and automation. Zoom went down last week. I talked about this in other videos, but that affected the time that it was down. Nobody could get on calls, so it like nuked the day. We had this major momentum and then it nuked the day. Then it didn't generate them out and then we still to this day are having issues. It's been almost a week, I think, or whatever day that was. It has had major out like repercussions. It had has had carry-on tail events that are still hurting us because people's zooms didn't integrate correctly. we can't lay back and then they didn't cross over whatever. So, wasn't working. Then I'm going into there trying to figure it out and I see that when we were in there tech team which I'm responsible for. These are me things and uh my I'm kind of responsible for it. I have a senior tech lead. We're changing things all the time. Like the focus is crazy. It's everywhere right now but it's scattered not everywhere in a good way. Um the pre-alls were off. So the initial texts were off that we send. So like all these dynamic cool whatever things are great until they're not and which is like if you turn them on accountingly they're on. If you try and do them custom and do this and then route this and AI and back and forth and whatever and like one thing breaks like you could have two days where you have no pre- calls that went out and your next two days are like 40% show rate. Like it's so stupid. So it frustrates me when that happens and we've done it a couple times and we lose you know upside of potentially 100 150 grand depending on how you look at it uh on a given one to three day range. So not ideal. And the same thing with app not booked. We are having an issue with our blue sending platform where we're trying to send it during like actual allowed hours because people apply but don't book across like 24 hours obviously. Um and it was like throttling weird and they weren't sending. We had like an 80% error rate. So like none of the app now books are going out but setters are hitting them. So whatever. Schedule versus purchase. Back to the pixel thing. We still are having an issue where we are we have never been able to optimize for schedule at scale ever. We do it for volume and it does back out but at a lower percentage. So like while they are like rorowaz positive, they're not at all anywhere near the purchase ones. But then when you run on purchase, we have these issues with these crazy cost pers on everything leading up to like way high way high. Um but then they back out. So we've had every Facebook person in the world look at this on the agency side, on the services side, on the solo media buyer side, on Facebook itself side, uh or meta, sorry, I should be saying. Um so we're talking about doing some dramatic things there. So I'll update you on that focus marketing sales setters. Um so what I mean by that is like we're doing all these things. Everything is a split test. Everything has its own data but then they all kind of conflict with each other and how they feed each other. A CMO is calling it the value vortex and it is working um but working in this like it's backing out yes but like it's hard to track you know the numbers and like what's in the pipeline and like who's building what. But then it needs to be launched. you have three VSSLs that are in the queue because we wanted them all, but like now where do you test them and how long? So, we're kind of doing all things at once right now, which I hate. I absolutely hate. It's like, let's get this and this like optimized. Let's see the exact percents now. Let's get this one 3% higher. Let's get this one 4% higher. But like we're kind of in the war zone right now trying to get back to steady 100k plus days. So, I feel it. And then sales and setters with the CPA, a big thing is like we're filling calendars. And I hate being like all blame or this or that, but like we have we always say like opportunity lift. if we see something that's just like glaringly like not where it's supposed to be, like there's an opportunity lift available. Uh it's in our sales setup and then setters for the what I meant by setters is the tracking. So I can't see their numbers perfectly because we're ramping them so hard. It's hard to like have them do the job and keep the data tracking. So that's kind of something we're actively managing. Um and then yeah, the marketing side is just like we're doing everything everything you could imagine. So trying to keep up with that. Um shout out to Ovens if you know you know. um holiday for call funnels. I just talked about that, but yeah, Sunday and any holiday. Uh we didn't ramp down spend prior because it's hard to navigate around that and so we're just biting it. But we didn't ramp down spend so we could stay into the week because it's very hard to scale up and down. And then funnel hackers, you guys, I don't care about sharing this. We don't care about sharing this stuff for you guys, but like man, my data and the things I see and people apply, it's like I'm showing you the things. You don't have to funnel hack me. I'm already showing you pages and flows and things. So, it's messing with my data, but it's not hurting the other parts. New new what we launched Loom in a pre-all. So, uh again, more Jeremy Hane stuff. He's a rockstar. And he talks about having them send like a pre-all uh or a postbooking pre-all style like selfie video from the sales rep. Our Alaware system we use does not allow for us to attach videos. It's a show. Uh so, we had everyone record a loom. We dynamically inserted it or we put it inside user properties in HubSpot and then we're dynamically inserting it as the intro message to be like, "Hey, check out this video." Like so you can put a face to the name. So we're testing that to see what it does for show rates. Might nuke them. Might help them. Constantly doing stuff. Splits on splits on splits. Uh everything is freaking splitting right now. Not everything, but this is splitting. This is splitting. This is splitting. These are just brand new. We just ripped them brand new because we know they're going to do better. Or we know. You don't know. You never know. Um, and then pixel Like I talked about, I almost uh I feel like Mark when I say stuff like this. I'm outside in Arizona right now and I was about to do this shirtless so I could really be like Mark. Um, more of the same scaling, just doing the same optimizing through backend stuff. We're talking about and I've talked about in other videos on how we're planning on increasing our LTV. We did 70 million basically 80% 70% whatever through new, which is just like crazy behavior and we have a recurring product. So, for us to not be focused on product and recurring and other offers and ways to sell them is stupid. We probably less left another I don't even know 50 million on the table like dummies. So, we're putting a big focus on that and that will be launched here soon and that'll only be on the back end. Um, so that'll be a good focus. And then setters taking over confirming right now. We have a call center that is doing our uh call confirmations. Um, so they call 20 hours a day, seven days a week. As soon as someone books in a call, and they confirm, hey, you do know this is Eastern time. You know, this is Zoom, right? We're dealing with 40 to 60-y old women. Um, and not as techsavvy. So, it's nice to be like, hey, you know, just touch point with them. Make sure they understand Zoom. They should be in a, you know, a quiet place, all that stuff. Uh, these calls are very short and the call center is great. The stats show that it is like this crazy uptick when they are connected with and confirmed. But the call center is a call center. Let's just say that. So, it is I love the guys who run it. Um, the girls who are there are great who are actually doing the calls, but there is definitely a bit of an accent barrier that I don't think aligns fully with our customers. And also just like the scripting and how much like how teachable they are um is not super there. So, our upon director is like, "Oh, no. We're absolutely going to take those over because those calls should be three minutes, seven minutes, whatever longer than a one and a half minute confirmation." So, this could be a huge uptick. I know a lot of people in the sales space. You see uh Ravi Avoola, you see Cole Gordon, you see these guys talk about this a lot where like they double book calendars. Your sales team can be like half the size and then you can double book calendars based on like uh lead quality confirmation versus not. Put it on the system that it didn't confirm it unless they respond. Like all these other like cool tactics that we have never done. Um which again is probably stupid as can be because we have 30 sales reps when we could have 15 or something like I I don't know. And then just or more so it's not even about having the quantity of sales reps. It's about the quality of the calendar and like how full it is and the no-show rates because I'm happy to have 30 sales reps. We're happy to have 50 sales reps. Uh sales reps rock, but we just need the bookings to show and have a full calendar of qualified people that have been primed. Um and we've kind of definitely optimized more as like a volume play over time and we're talking about reigning that in. So, this could be a big lift for us. That's all I got. Today's a different one instead of like a teaching thing really or I don't even like teaching. It's just sharing what I'm doing and what is working. None of these are ego. None of these are fluff. This is like I just said, we're like bleeding and trying to figure this out. So, I have people in my DMs that are doing bigger numbers, which is amazing. And I love it. And I'm learning things like literally by the day. So, please keep that coming. Uh, I put together a doc. I can't figure out something on ClickFunnels, so I have to have www right now. And I'm not looking to fix it. Um, but I put together a doc of all the videos so far. Yesterday's stats. I already talked about the Rev yesterday or cash collected, not Rev. So, I can't believe I just said that. and high ticket, nine buyers, which is low. That's what I was saying. Nine. Nine is low for us with the amount of calls. That should be 12 to 15. Um, when we're like crushing it, crushing it. So, like 12 is the accurate number. Uh, low ticket buyer 60. We're scaling this back up because the numbers are backing out. We want to confirm they're backing out. Now, we just need to hold that CPA. 85gs. I'm not going to sleep properly until we're steady state over 100. So, that's what I got. Guys, subscribe. 2500. I get new laptops. So stuff starts glitching. It's a joke around here. Comment any topic ideas. I'm doing a lot of stuff on X right now. Instagram kind of and then mainly here at X. Uh so yeah, like this if this was helpful. DM me if you think I'm doing something stupid and I should be doing something different because that happens on the daily. and I will talk to you guys soon.

# we have 110+ Employees. here is how we manage them | E38
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taC9zoADBpU

In today's video, we're going to be talking about how we manage our remote team of over 110 employees in our info coaching business. I'm going to start by going through a quick org chart overview and then break it down by all company ops, marketing, tech, sales, CS, and product and go through the different meeting schedules we have, the data and dashboards behind them, and the channels that we use to communicate and manage. Sorry about the noise in the background. I'm traveling. So, that is what it is. Then, if you stick around to the end, it's going to be yesterday's stats, high ticket buyers, low ticket buyers, and cash collected. And a quick company update. Last year we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching biz. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what didn't work, and what we are actively doing that either works or doesn't. Uh all of the goal to find talent opportunities and network with cool people doing the same. All right, then I ask you to subscribe just if you want to see more of these. Comment if you like something or if you have topic requests and like the ones you like. So let's get into it. The video is glitching. I'm sorry. I need a new laptop at 2500 subs. So marketing over here. We'll get into these kind of deeper, but marketing is going to be this section. Tech is going to be this section. Sales setters are going to be this section. People and CS and kind of some like ancillary ones that live under these are going to be here. So, let's just get straight into it. For all company, the channels that they're going to live in for everything. So, it's going to be all departments are in these is just the general, which is basically used for announcements uh and notifications of all hands, meetings, birthdays, all that kind of stuff. Uh it is locked and only used for admin purposes to post into it. Walking the walk is a super fun one. It is us doing it right. It is a fitness company and so it is us doing fitness. It is us sharing fitness. It is us living the methodology in life in nutrition, in health, in lifestyle and everything. So walk in the walk is a fun one. Client wins is that same is style thing but of win of clients, right? So they're in there sharing wins um from the coaching section uh wins that they get in CS, wins that the sales team finds, right, of uh in the communities, everything like that. And it's just like a hype up channel and just to show what we're doing works. Okay, big one there. And then the only meeting that we have that's everyone is a monthly all hands meeting that is basically we put a slide deck together and we go through it. It is the first week of the month. Um and it's about an hour long. We do wins, we do company updates, we do all that kind of stuff. Ops, this one is going to have an operations channel. So for us, ops is CEO, C chief, whatever I am officer, uh CMO, tech lead, who's basically CTO. I kind of like stand in that place, but is what it is. uh sales director, which is actually right now like our closer manager, setter manager. So you're going to have, sorry, let me clear this up. CEO, COO, CTO, CMO, uh setter manager, closer manager, CS manager, and chief of people. Okay, so that's who is currently on that meeting. The dashboard that fires into the channel every day is completely automated and the time ranges are going to be yesterday and then month-to- date, quarter to date, year-to- date of actual numbers. Then trends of where they are targeting for monthto date, quarter to date, year-to- date and then in comparison to those ranges as well. Okay. And then metrics that we track are gross rev, net rev, new rev, active rev, ad expense, refund dollars and percentage, booking count, client count, and then the cost per in comparison to the ad spend. Okay. And again, that is yesterday, month, quart. So this is just like a overarching operating dashboard that fires into there. We do go deeper in the actual ops meeting that are kind of more tangible uh or like actionable is probably a better word actionable metrics. These are all as well but like we have ones that people have to manually collect and bring into a meeting. We're a big fan of automating but we have found that we overautomated and people were not tied to numbers and connection because we didn't ask them to do that or to fill out things. So that's there. Uh weekly ops meeting uh for us is going to be about an hour. The monthly is the same team we do the monthlies with and the quarterlys with and generally those are an hour and a half to two hours. And then we have a one uh one to one. So Tuesday is the ops meeting, Thursday is going to be one to ones. And we operate those as a waterfall. So it'll start as me and CEO in the beginning just us touching base and then it'll add chief of people then it'll add CMO. like and we go in this waterfall order so that if we want to carry people through because they're not we're not a huge super fan of you know let's dive deep and like what's happening in your personal life and like oneto ones at that cadence I do believe that that is very important and like knowing people as people um but on a weekly cadence and basis it's a lot more actionable and like if something happens in a vacuum over here with marketing and then isn't shared over here like a lot of time things get construed and not shared correctly. So, we're big about communication, transparency, one of our core values. Marketing channel, we're gonna have marketing main, which is like the master. Hilarious, but like we did not have this for years and our acquisition blew up. So, maybe that's key. Um, but marketing is the master that has everything in it. We have a creative paid, we have a creative organic, and because these have different contractors or different people in them for like paid ads, for example, and the creative organic is more distribution as well as obviously creative of it, but like distribution, too. And then on the tale of organic, a lot of the time the stuff will go on the website. So, there's like uh page builders and stuff in there. If my video is glitching out, I'm sorry. I'm going to try and move this around for you because I'm in the sun. Then, uh you're going to have copyrightiting channel, which is just going to be our CMO, me, uh CEO, and our um CMO, copywriter, me, and CEO. Yeah. So, that's basically just an OG channel. That's what we used to operate out of as our marketing channel, but now we have that. And then Paige Bills is an external guy that crushes for us that's new. So we keep that dedicated because kind of like it's the fun crazy build it crazy idea channel. Okay. Dashboards same ranges for this is going to be on all the data points and that is going to go over the marketing stats. So the core ones leads apps bookings clients the cost per across for all those and then new rev and then spend. Okay, which gets us the new rorowaz which we have a target that it is red or green on all these. So, same with these. They are red or green if they're in KPI or not uh against target as well as against uh comparison metrics. Okay? So, like the trend lines are going to tell you if you're on pace for target. And the comparison is going to tell you are you beating yourself or not compared to last metrics. Now, there are certain ones like ad expense for example that is kind of like gray area. It's like do you want your ad expense to be higher or lower? It's like depends. Um do you want your cost per client to be higher or lower? Always lower generally speaking. Do you want your cost per booking? Kind of depends. I mean like you do want it lower but depending on how the funnel is and if you're running more qualified versus not like it can depend but like CPA you want that lower right so it varies. Sorry this video is probably just annoying too but dashboard two is one that is more so as a target. So, this one is going to be a 14-day rolling. And I have a video talking about how I built this, but calls on day, open spots, and booked percentage because the target booked percentage is 80. And the open spots looking out 30 days can tell you where we need to roughly estimate based on what the cost per call is where we need to roughly or how much we need to roughly spend over ranges to make sure that the calendars for the sales reps are full. It's a constant dance of doing that. Um, and then there's also technically a third-ish dashboard in here because we're ramping low ticket right now, but because forever we have just been a high ticket call funnel. Um, this has been the core dashboards forever. Okay, we have a weekly all meeting. We just had our third or so like actual one of these that is led by the CMO. He's a rockstar. This is all kind of fresh. I'm not trying to steal his jazz. Um, and again, these actually I let me go into this. This is led by chief of people and um sales director is like super hypy. So, it's really good in this. The ops is run by me. The marketing is read is run by the CMO. Um, and then ad hoc, they'll constantly just like pop on, oh, can you do this time? Can you do this time? And just jam about things in the ad account. We spend heavily on meta. We do have a Google contractor, and those are kind of like one-offs. Um, but yeah, ad hoc means beyond that. Okay, so that's where we're at. So, we just covered CMO and or I'm sorry, marketing and ops. Now, tech. Technically speaking, this is like my department. Um we have one channel it's tech admin and then technically we're in every channel. Okay so we're constantly kind of filling all this stuff. The tech admin is the main channel that we manage on. All this is about how we manage and kind of overlook not the part of where we are active in and like what part they're in but that's where we manage in and it's basic tech projects. We have all the big notifications that happen in there. If a zap turns off the this like that's where we go to come together and talk about things or what's happening. Um dashboards for that automation error rates. We track these as a percentage. We have a project board that's like basically an IDS list. So all of these technically have this is about channels, meetings and dashboards, not about how we do it, but we have IDS lists. So we operate on like a lean version of EOS. And each one of these departments will have their own IDS list of like projects where they're at updates on those on a weekly basis in those dashboards. Project board and then tech tickets submitted. We track this as a number over time of how many texts tickets submit. And then if there's things that uh continuously happen and are recurring, then we will try to automate so it does not happen or figure out what the source of it is and try to solve for it and we use this ticketing system to do so. And then weekly I have a onetoone with the senior tech lead um and we go over what's priority now, what was completed and then as of the last three weeks or so he drops a daily thing on projects he's working on because we are more we're like swamped right now. We're adding crazy automations and this and that. So prioritization is huge and so he can go into deep work while also having to sometimes put out fires when things break. Okay. So we started that a few weeks ago. It's going very very well. Sales and setters. Sales ops is going to be all of the admin and management side of things. Sales team is going to be the entire sales rep team. We technically then have a setter team one. There's like 15 other channels that are notification channels. Apps uh that haven't been people that app but didn't book within the last three minutes. That's for setters that hit. Uh we have custom booking time request forms that hit other channels. We have uh all of the apps, all the bookings, all the direct bookings, all the setter bookings, all like everything. And I don't want to go into that, but like where we operate and manage out of are of these. They have a dashboard. This is that fires into the operations is for management. management will get, and this is kind of more on like the hard stats, not the activity, because they're going to have hard stats, they're going to have activity, and then they're going to have like trends and cash numbers, right? As and I'll get into that one, but so for the dashboard for this, we're going to have bookings, we're going to have call. So bookings generated on day, we're going to have calls on day. We're going to have the booked percentage. We're going to have new clients. Sales per booking is what we track as like again on the activity tracker. You're going to see show rates, you're going to see offer rates, you're going to see live call close rates, you're gonna see all that. Sales per booking is a quick number for us as a management to be like how many bookings happened to how many closed. Okay? And we know what that metric is. We know what these numbers should be. Then if you want to dig into the numbers like why do we have a 7% sales per booking? It's like oh our offer percentage was 60%. Our live call closes that oh and our our show rate was 40%. Oh we broke an automation. Oh there's a bad something like that's we you can dig into the numbers. This is a higher view. New ROZ is going to be um that number from over here. So new rev basically divide by ad expense on day and then across ranges. I didn't put that on here but all of these all are across monthto date, quarters to date, year to date and actual ranges and then trend lines. Uh cost per client CPA uh we like to share that with them as well just so they have a gauge. Setter availability setter 2025 and sales 2025. Setter availability is used for us to gauge how much we can spend into the low ticket because that is the throttle point. So like as long as we keep net CPA in alignment as it begins to as we begin to spend on more units we need to make sure that the next step of the funnel which is the Otto book a call and I've gone into that in other videos we need to make sure that the availability is there. Okay, so that's there. Setter 2025 and sales 2025. These are the activity trackers. How many calls, how many shows, how many whatever all the way down offer rates, um, all that. I technically track all that in the CRM, but these are manual fill outs that we require through forms that autofill. This is detailed today. Apologies. Dashboard for the reps. They're going to see show rates. They're or they're actually going to have bookings in here, but I don't want to type that. It'll mess my boxes up. We're going to have bookings. We're going to have show rates. Net new rev is the key one we track. So that pulls out refunds. We do clawbacks and refunds. Points. These are natural points. So points are different on weekend and weekday. You get 1.5 on weekend for cash collected dollars. And we do that to incentivize people to work on the weekend. So we get more even amount of open spots. So ad spend does not have to be throttled. Okay. Base is going to be everyone has the same base, but we just put on a dollar there because we do everyone W2. Comms is a percentage and you are at different comms percentages based on how good and how long you've been on the team. bonus is a throttle, I'm sorry, a tier uh approach based on how many points you're at for the given pay period, which is every two weeks. And then the total pay, okay, this is what they'll see. These are dashboards that fire into the channel all the time, so everyone sees the numbers. Transparency key meetings, five dimes a week huddle for setters and sales. They both happen at the same time and then they have a dual one and then they have their own weekly sales ops where they basically come together, setter manager and closer manager, and they have better titles in that. I'm just outbound director and sales director. So they have uh they have a onetoone connect between them. Then they also have one with me and the CEO. Okay. CS frankly I am not as well verssed in their full thing. I don't sit in on their meetings because they are so good I don't need to. Right. So I am much more marketing sales tech ops that style. Uh not as much CS and product. They crush it at this already. And the chief of people operates and runs all of this department very very well. She's a rockstar. Okay. They have a channel. They talk in CS they have a dashboard and these numbers are then brought to operations meeting refunds escalations is what we call it which is like a refund request they have like an entire team and system around reverting these and making it so they don't occur again killer team killer killer CS is like in every channel helping everyone are the most like proactive sweet nice like helpful people in the world um so they have escalations group engagement they track reviews and referrals all these we track across weekly basis we watch trend lines and we have targets okay meetings I I was talking about this like again I'm not even on these but they were literally talking about they're like oh yeah we're just daily touch point we're like just on Zoom all day like they just chat when they're not in between these calls. So they have pure blocked out calls because they all take onboarding calls for the new clients. Okay so when a new client comes in they fill out an onboarding form and they book a call with a CS rep then is the pass off to the fillment. These are called different things but I'm just using like generalized names like customer fulfillment right so product VIP team they have their own dedicated channel in there these numbers are reported back so this one's kind of more difficult again they they operate this like in their own vacuum they just crush this like fulfillment team like they don't even have to worry about the other ones which is great like the different departments kind of like connect on all hands and in the general chats but like they run their stuff they run their stuff and for even says it for the 900th time we got too big. We have too many team kind of too much team because we were scaling into the people and our acquisition was climbing while we were climbing uh in cash and when acquisition broke we had already scaled up the people and like we kind of need a lot of them. We did get down a little bit but like we're built to be doing 2.5 minimum amount two whatever. We're built really to we could go to five, right? So like when we're in these low numbers we are bleeding. It is not good. We are break even or bleeding depending side tangent. Okay. Active clients, non-active clients. We have a formula for this, but who becomes a non-active client? Um, and then we have it's a tracker and a percentage thing. Uh, call tracker, message tracker, MPS and open roster. So these are all we built a custom tool that tracks and AIs all the stuff and basically takes sentiment from calls, takes call length, takes call count, compares it against booking count, compares it against client count and basically it is an analytic suite for us to be able to see the performance of a coach and then inside a coach or multiple coaches inside a team. So we have teams that are broken down of coaches because we have 65 70 coaches on any given time. And we have all these in here so we can see who is performing and what we can put them up against. And then open roster is a number similar to open spots that you have over here in marketing. That is how many open spots do we have on the team on the roster across the team. So that we know that when we start ramping marketing and sales and they start to spend into it, we need to know as a trigger when we get under 300 open spots or whatever, which is in the past like our big months were 400 and something units, 500, whatever, like when we start to get nearing that uh 300 number, we start to hire again. So we have more coaches, so we have more bandwidth. Okay. Then weekly they have a one to one uh they have one to ones, I'm sorry, I believe monthly at this point now. And then they have a weekly all hand or all coaching meeting. Okay, that was a lot. So, I hope the audio isn't too bad. I hope my video is not glitching too bad. And I hope this makes sense. And you can ask questions. You can do whatever in the chat. I hope this is helpful to what we track and what we do. Quick stats on yesterday. I think I'm gonna start stop doing this part. Let me know if I should keep doing it. like this part's kind of funky and people on X and whatever are being like weird about like oh like let me know if I need to keep doing this. I I don't need to but seven we dove automations broke and we didn't know Wednesday Friday and everything exploded and then add that to the zoom thing not good good as a percentage our low ticket buyers turning into high ticket buyers is just getting better and better we just need to get CPA and then we also need to be able to scale that so we are talking about doing AOV boosts on that so that the net CPA on a low ticket portion continues to stay in this low thing as we scale which normally speaking As you do more volume and scale, it will go up. So, we're trying to get ahead of that before we do it. 50 G's yesterday, not great. 1.5 average for the month at that rate, which is not great. So, but today's already ripping, so and it's what, 3:00. So, that's what I got. I hope this was helpful. Subscribe 2500. I'm getting a new laptop as a reward just because it's funny. Comment anything you got. X Instagram, everything's in the comments. Let me know. Talk soon.

# we built a 110+ person team... (full hiring system) | E37
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWby_qtccXA

In today's video, I'm going to be sharing our talent acquisition system and frameworks that we use to grow our company to over 110 employees and contractors. I'm going to quickly go through our org chart just so we're on the same page and then get right into it talking about the secrets behind this, the different types, our approach, sources, all the jazz, and then give you guys real examples of how we would hire a copywriter, a senior tech admin, a CMO, and how we actually did it. All right, then I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I make these videos every single day. So, I will talk buyers, cash collected, Stripe, and an overall company update. Last year, we did 30 million cash collected. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, what we are actively doing to try and scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of cool people doing the same. All right, so subscribe to these if you like them and you want to see more. Comment some feedback and some topic requests and like them if you like them and don't if you don't. So, let's get into it. um to start CEO is going to be the other co-founder um or the co-founder. I'm not a co-founder. Okay, clear that up. Um is going to be the co-founder and I come in as chief whatever officer. I hate titles, but it's chief tech, it's chief operating, it's integrator, it's whatever you want to call it. Um definitely more of like the vision side of things and definitely more of the detail orientated um action operation side of things. Okay, if these are lagging again, I need to get to 2500 subscribers and I'm going to buy a new laptop. So, GG. Then you got the marketing department. All the classic things. You guys can stop this and look down look back at this if you want, but the media buyers, the copyriters, all the things in marketing, sales are going to be broken out into um oops, I'm sorry. Tech is right here. So senior tech lead is kind of like technically right here, but I just have it here for this example. Um tech lead is or tech department is just going to be these two people. Sales is going to be a setter division and a closer division. And then a basically like admin or operations of that of both departments. And then you're going to have people and product which is going to be what we're talking about today a lot but that's going to be everything from CS to the fulfillment side uh and the coaching and then basically these are all going to be pieces of kind of marketing a little bit um market this is marketing this is sales and these are going to be the people side of things. So, managing people, uh, onboarding, and then once they're in, right? So, the real secret behind this, you can hire one person and not even have to worry about this. Okay, so the example of this, and it's so funny because I literally called my our chief of people right before this, and I was like, I'm going to make this video, just FYI. And I know you do all of this because she crushes this for us, okay? She is the one who sources this, hires them, interviews, onboards, offboards, like everything for us. So, the real secret, hire one and then the video's over. Okay? Like, I know that's not realistic for a lot of people who are have one or two or five or whatever team, but like you can get to a point where you can have somebody on the team that leads this entire thing for you if this is not your strength. If this is your strength, you're probably not even watching this. So, this is just like a first principles thinking or like just top down approach. It's like if you can manage to do this, you don't have to worry about a lot of this. Okay. Now, obviously that's simpler said than done. So, let's get into it on the actuals. How we look at hiring is hiring for constraints. We had a period where we were really strong on this and then we hit a period where we were not very strong on this and got kind of like too heavy where it was like, oh, it'd be nice to have and then we got it. Oh, it'd be nice to have instead of a, oh, this is like on fire or burning. And you kind of want to dance between those two, but lean towards the it's on fire in my opinion. Okay? And why I say that is it's going to keep your cash tighter or cash more flush. You're going to keep the team tighter. Um, and I think it's just a better overall way to go about it. So everything is a funnel. What I mean by this, and I think this is either my thinking or how everything actually is, but I see this in everything in the world. So everything is a funnel. Meaning you are going to have a 100red applications or you're going to have a 100red eyeballs on your job post. You're going to have 50 applications. You're going to have five that are good. You're going to have three that are going to pass an interview. You're going to have one that fits the criteria and you hire, right? As an example, that's all what this is. So whether you have a system, you have if you're talking calls, if you're talking um dating, if you're talking whatever, like everything can be seen as these funnels as they get down. Um and I think that's very important for this especially when we start to talk about these recurring roles. So examples in our organization who are uh recurring that we're recurring hiring for is going to be something like coach. So I know I said 110 here but there's one box but this is like 65 to 70 people right now. Okay CS reps three or four right now. Setters 10 closers 20some. So like you need to constantly be hiring for these especially if they're high churn. So, a coach, a sales rep, a setter. Setter is like notoriously a higher churn position just because it's a lower tunch. Um, sales reps, sameish. Coaches, not as much, but can depending on how your team is in your fulfillment. And then one-offs are going to be something like an HR manager. You're not going to continuously be hiring for an HR manager, a senior tech lead, a CMO, right? Those are the examples I'm going to go down or a version of the examples down here, but these are one-off hires versus recurring hires. And you need to approach that in a different way. So the need whether you're doing recurring or one-off is you either need evergreen approach or a singular approach. Okay, evergreen meaning that is continuously happening. You constantly have a pipeline or you're filling your funnel of people for the role. Singular meaning you're just going right for it. You need it for this one time. Yes, if there's other situations, you might have a couple in the pipeline, but very common for you to just really be hunting for the right person and then placing them. Okay. How you're going to approach the hiring is either public or private. And I'll go into kind of the differences of those. And then the sources being um I was using as an example of a copywriter versus an HR director. So the sources that you will find them where your traffic is. You can look at this literally like a marketing funnel, but like where the traffic that you are getting for this position is going to be in different buckets. Same way that you would run ads at this audience versus this audience or you would use this traffic source versus this traffic source for different types of people. You do the same thing if you're going to be trying to hire for a copywriter. You're going to be living in marketing world and marketing groups and marketing areas versus HR. You're going to be living in Indeed and more corporate professional LinkedIn style. Okay. So, for evergreen, you are going to want a system and a funnel. So, an example that we did is we actually I think it was called high ticket fitness closer. So, we built an entire VSSL call funnel that was for hiring because we needed them that bad and it worked. We've had like 98% of them churn over time and that's a whole another story about like keeping people and managing and all that and performance and whatever and training but for just getting them this was crazy good for us. So it literally was an opt-in to a VSSL, an application, a book a call, all the automations and emails on the side and then booking in and we were doing at that time for a while we had a direct booking but then we removed that and then we just left it as just application and we reached out to the ones we wanted just cuz we want like we wanted to make sure they were qualified before just popping on everyone's calendars. Um but this worked for us for a long time but you can do this with anything. So, as long as you have the application, the booking, or just the application, you can run different traffic sources, whether that's ad, and I'll get into the sources, but whether that's ads, um, whether that is recurring community posts and emails. So, like for a long time, we've hired out of our community. our first 30 to 50 sales reps that crushed for us that like we had a sales rep that came from our community, purchased our product, actually longer story, but ended up in our community, purchased our product, then purchased our back-end product that we weren't even selling at the time, the coaching, and then became a coach or I'm sorry, then became a sales rep, then was the top sales rep that then became a manager and made over like 400 grand the first year that we like took off because she was crushing it so bad. and she was a hybrid between like a lead manager and a performer, but she was the top performer by far and made 400 grand. It's like you can find quality people because those kind of people that are already in your product have the highest belief, the understanding of the product, like the certainty around that. A lot of the time they just need to learn the sales skill versus the other way of hiring which is like they need the sales skill and then they can learn the product or you know resonate with the market. And we've had both that have worked. Like some of our top sales reps still are people who are customers and then we have flipped it to we were hiring for sales skill and then teach them product because that felt like it might have been a better approach. Not to say it is or isn't. Uh I don't really know. It's just like the conviction and also being able to match the buyer persona is huge. Like if you sell to 46-y old women and you are a 46 4 to6 year old woman who went through the process, who paid the top dollar already for it, who did all the things that you're asking this person to do, in my opinion, it's a little bit easier than somebody who is a 22-year-old internet marketing high ticket sales closer who's just potentially bullying them over the line or putting them in position. Like there's just not the same resonance. So, so side tangent, but uh recurring in the community posts and having cadence for that, running ads and then singular sniping. Okay, so sniping I'm a big fan of and I'm going to kind of go into that here, but I don't sniping and poaching similar but not poaching and pulling people from like partnering organizations and stuff. Not good. But if you are pulling them in a way that you have a great company, you have a great brand, you have a great offer, you have a great comp plan, you have all these things, and that person is looking at other things. I don't believe that they shouldn't leave. I I mean, I I think that that is all fair game. So, I like sniping. We've had some of our best people come from other places, whether that's just another job or another similar like in a different role or the same role. I think there's a big one, public and private. What I mean by this, let's say you have somebody who is pretty high up in your organization. In this example, let's use a CMO. We just hired a fantastic CMO. He's like a month in and he's crushing it. And like I can give more updates on that in the future. But let's just say we were hiring with for the CMO because we and the seat is currently filled. We have a CMO, but we want another one because of performance, because something's wrong, just something that is going to change how you approach your hiring. So you're going to either go public or you're going to go private. So, you're either going to have this on your job boards, you're going to have it listed everywhere, or you're going to be sniping and looking around and trying to find somebody through network and connections. Now, cautionary tale, especially to all these info and and coaching style thing uh companies, the industry is small, small, small. So, as soon as there's a feeler out there, it is like not it once the feeler's out there, people start assuming things. People start telling each other, "Oh, this is this happening." people start just getting on interviews just to like get information. So like you need to be very careful unless you're going outside of industry which is what we have done a couple of times for like some pretty key roles and hires. Um but in the hot seat ones, the sales marketing, those are tough. Those are you're people are going to know when you're hiring. So it's just I obviously like to be very transparent and like raw about this. So like I try to do that in this. There are times where you can't be as transparent maybe as you want to or as public as you want to um because it could affect the company's performance and the rest of the team because you have to solve for one person because that one person affects hundred other people's employees or lives and families and things like there's a time and a place. So sources the core positions a lot of the time can be filled from niche job boards. The generalist ones are in normal job boards. So, a normal one is going to be like a a bookkeeper, a um the HR director, stuff like that. Those are going to be in more corporate normal job boards, okay? Like you want them to have I could do a whole video on like mission, values, principles, and alignment and like remote versus in person and all that stuff. But like for sourcing for those positions, generally speaking, you can find them through an Indeed or whatever. Run some ads on there, host it, make sure you have good listings, make sure you have that. Okay. Niche boards/f Facebook groups. The amount of times we've found people in the internet marketing world or like the info coaching space from the info and coaching space, job boards or just like specific boards is like 90% hit rate. So, I'm a big fan of these. Nothing held back has a really good one. Um, and then just in general, if you're in the groups, you see people uh ads. I talked about this a little bit earlier, but running ads direct to them. You generally would only do this on something that is a recur a recurring like evergreen style one where you consistently need inflow. Um, but you could do it for anything. Um, and then two big ones that I really, really like are company brand and owner brand. So, company brand being like, I've heard of you. I've seen it in the space. We see your ads all the time. We something. I've always thought what you could do is really high quality. And that comes back to how you operate the company or how the company is and is reflected uh in the space. And if you have good enough there and someone looks at your stuff and you have great trust pilot reviews and you have like that's huge. So, like that draws people in and at least like puts their the the barrier they have down. Um, and I think that's big. And then owner brand. In the end, it's people working with people. Uh, and I'll get into that in these examples, but what I'm doing here, for example, is all about finding and networking with people both for personally and then also professional. It's kind of like a mix. My entire life is a complete mix of professional versus personal. And like that's what this is. It's raw. Sharing what I'm doing 99% of the day, which is this and talking about it and then finding other cool people who like to do the same thing. And I have a flood of DMs right now of media buyers, of copywriters, of content things, of other people operating the space that people work in uh the same vertical or different verticals and like it's lead genen and ecom and oh cool we also do that and like there is so much talent out there that if you are good people, you find good people is my opinion on that. So that's what I'm trying to do here. Um and then the other co-founder, he already does that or the co-founder again, I'm not a co-founder. um the one of the co-founders uh does really good with this as well and I'll get into that with these. So, copywriter VSSL editor, how would I find this? So, first off, our current copywriter we found as the co-founder that I was just referring to, he went to high school with the guy, stayed connected, they knew each other, he got into copywriting, he started writing copy for us, and he was like number three on the marketing team, me being two, and the copyriter being three. Like, I was building pages, doing tech. Um other co-founder Luke was doing uh all the paid media buying, creative stuff like that. And then he came in as a copywriter. Still to this day is with the company. He writes two emails a day, every single day and does all of our automations and all of the things. Okay. So, where I would find one now and how we found a VSSL editor is I go into these niche job boards that are specific to internet marketing and I go and find um make posts about this pushing them into an application or or into a DM where I then have conversation. So we have gotten 50 of these just from making like one or two posts because we put company information. So we have the company brand and we put rough numbers around comp and then we push them into there. Okay. Senior tech admin. This one is completely different. I could not for the life of me hire for this when I wanted to. And essentially what this was was a replacement of me. It was like how do I find somebody that can replace me in all the tech builds, the automations, all those pieces. And I couldn't do it. I couldn't figure it out. And I tried like two or three times and respect the guys who came in and all good, but like the skill capacity was not there. Um, and I didn't know how to hire for it or title it or anything. We ended up finding senior tech admin, doing it, watched a bunch of Laya's video, who crushes at this by the way. Listen to her. She has way more employees, way more success, all this. I'm just sharing my examples um or my experience for the senior tech admin. We ended up posting on Indeed. The chief of people was like, "Oh, let's frame it this way." instead had 10 applications, found one in there, and lo and behold, it was somebody who had had their own fitness company prior that then went out at like stopped doing their business and wanted to work somewhere that was in alignment with that was crazy technical background. Then came on to the then interviewed I talked to two or three people that she introed me to and he was a perfect fit and now he's to the day to this day part of this. He has stepped up in the role. He's essentially becoming the CTO or is the CTO. Only reason he's not is cuz I'm in the way to be honest. And uh yeah, so that was like a indeed classic normal job board hire. Couple applications came through interview through me onboarding to the systems. I'm not going to go into the entire fulfillment of systems and hiring or processing and all that and ramping. That can be another video in operations, but that's how we found him. Perfect. CMO. This is an example of in the industry, difficult to find, kind of needing to snipe, but we were being public about. Okay. So, we're like, we're looking for a CMO. We went to the ClickFunnels uh funnel hacking live. We're walking around. We're like, we need a CMO. We need a CMO. And we're already in the talks with a couple people. One person is, you know, leaving XYZ organization already and interested, but has this experience. Another person is currently in a role, but like we want them. Other people are applying in that aren't currently in a position. So, we're trying to navigate. Generally speaking, the person we want is the person that already has experience or as a person is someone who already has experience, who has done the thing and can bring in their like it into our systems and bring it into our company and deploy their systems and experience. Okay, more or less that's almost always the person who's currently in a role versus somebody who is not. Not to say always because there are people who leave places because of cultural issues or things that they don't want and then they come in. There are people who are on the market completely because something happened with the company that was not part of their department that was running successfully and now they're looking for a gig. But overall, a lot of the time a players are inside companies already. Um, so that's how this one came to us. It was kind of a mix of those. It was like leaving it because of this, but then also wanted to find something new at the same time. Was looking at multiple offers and was getting hunted by multiple people. And this all came through a connection that the co-founder that Luke had with this person already from being in the industry and having conversations. And it was like a networking personto person thing came in and then we checked the boxes for oh wow the company brand's amazing. The trust pilot's great. The people are great. Um the the foundation is there. I can implement this pocket of skills into the company and put them there. Okay. So those are some examples. I hope this is what you guys meant when you said talent acquisition system because it's pretty simple like it's a funnel. It's like you need traffic, you need different conversion events, and you need to optimize them and then get them through. It gets way crazier in like how we on board and like what systems we use and like what the cadence is of meetings and like the ramping period and all that. And like I can talk on it, but I'm definitely not the best person to do it uh or to explain that. I can get information on it and try and explain that or get that for you guys. But this is how I look at this. So yesterday's stats. Also, sorry videos and Loom and all this. It's terrible. I see it jumping in the corner. But yesterday, 11 high ticket buyers. Let's go. Not great, but not as bad as we've been. 37 low ticket. Oh gosh, that's not right. I got to keep I always do this. 72,000 is okay. I'm not going to breathe air the same until we're at 100K a day steady again because that's when that's my happy place as a minimum. So, but this is good. This is right direction. We had a ton of calls though, so the sales per booking was not actually where we wanted it. But we had a ton of calls at the same spend, which is amazing um because of how we're testing things with the two different VSSL style funnels, the low ticket and like ascension and all that. So the math is getting closer to mathing. All right. Um I had some other Oh, that was the other update real quick. So I had the Zoom thing I talked about where Zoom went down and we didn't have the Zoom links generated and people couldn't get on calls. So it was like a twofold thing. It was like during the period that Zoom was down, we couldn't get on calls with anyone and had to try and reach them via phone after telling them they could only do the call via Zoom 40 times. So that was a bad part of the day. So we had whatever seven or eight units that day and then nothing for the rest of the day. During that period when we got new calls booked, it was not generating a Zoom link. Even after Zoom was fixed, people had to reintegrate their Zoom accounts with Kali. We don't have the techsavviest sales rep crew. Um, love them. They're amazing at what they do, but tech they'll say it's not their strong suit. Um, so it was not re they had to reconnect all of them in order to generate them. So that took until the next day. So you have a 48 hour window. So we're finally getting out of the thick of it and we go to look at something this morning and I'm like, why are the show rates? I just made a show video about how we hit 72% on setters. At blended we're at 62 to 65%. Like the last two days since then we're 40ome and I'm like oh it's Zoom. One of the automations was broken and not sending any of our custom reminders. So me, this is just like it's always something. Some something's always on fire. So, hope that was helpful. If not, tell me privately. Uh, and yeah, subscribe, comment if you have any feedback. Um, I dropped a dock. Where is the dock? Somewhere. Um, but I dropped the dock on all the videos all combined into one. X is where I'm talking the most. Instagram, communication, all the things. So, I will talk to you guys soon. Hope you appreciated this one. Bye.

# we hit 72% show rates in our funnel... here's how. | E36
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6BX0FtHmOI

In today's video, we're going to be talking about show rates for VSSL call funnels. The industry goal for this is around 75% on qualified bookings. And we just took ours from the 40s to the 60s using this setup right here. So, I'm going to do a deep dive into the pages, the emails, the SMS, all the things that we are using to accomplish this. And then some cool ninja future changes that we are implementing and removing actually um to try and accomplish this 75%. All right. Then, if you stick around to the end of the video, I'll go through yesterday's stats. I make these videos every single day. So, I'll go through yesterday's buyers cash collected and just a general update. Yesterday was a fun one. So, if you stick around, you'll hear that last year, we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. And everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and build a network of cool people doing the same. All I ask is to subscribe if you want to see more of these. comment some feedback and other topic posts you want to see and like the ones you like. So, let's get into it. So, for us, the three different ways that bookings are going to come in, and I have videos on the channel where I do like a deep dive into the actual funnel and everything that happens prior to this, but the three different types of bookings that are going to happen are financially qualified versus DQed. And then DQED still closes. It's just at, you know, half the rate or 60% of the rate of these uh financially qualified. And financially qualified is coming from the application. So these ones are going to close at a higher rate. They go to the top closers and best closers. That's was a hormoney thing that we rolled out. The DQ ones go to pod two closers which are either, you know, struggling pod one that have the top leads and trying to get them back on track, work their pipeline and maybe get less lead flow as well as new ramping reps are going to start here. And then setter bookings are going to come into pod one closers because these are the most high intent high quality directly very comparable but directly and then go to those closers right so the industry will say 75% 80% plus and I've heard of people doing 80% plus like relatively at scale which is unreal because we have never been at those numbers so when we did 30 million last year it was around 55% or something like that. So, for us right now, we just achieved 62. And if I pull up the tracker like day over day, we were in the 40s for a minute. Um, which is not good. Um, just because you're burning 60% of your bookings at that point, financially qualified or not. So, for us, the two different main sources, I'm just going to bucket these as financially qualified and um, DQed. Those I'm are marketing bookings direct. And then we have sets. So, for our marketing monthto date, right? Yeah. Month to date, today's the 17th. So 17 days into the month, we are on average at 49% with our marketing show rates and 72% with our setter show rates. So if you get nothing else from this video, our stats on our uh setters is already almost at this. And this is with brand new setters that we are ramping and just now launching this month. So like if you get nothing else from the video, add setters. I'm going to do a huge deep dive into like all the confirmation uh communication how we fra frame everything and do all that but just that alone would get you there. Now the economics change and pieces of the you know puzzle change but crazy and we've never had setters. We didn't have setters for the last 70 million 71 million like just crazy. So current setup offer framing why and continuity. So what I mean by this is basically why is somebody getting on the phone and making sure that that messaging stays as continuity throughout it. So are they applying to work with you and then getting on the phone because they're applying for your program? Are they getting on the phone for a free consultation or assessment around this and that and what topic? Like holding that offer framing we've seen already has just completely changed just the continuity. It's like someone is applying for this, they know it's this, they know, right? you have higher close rates, higher show rates, all of this because they know they're applying for the program. They know that they're going to get pitched, one example. But if you're going to do the other example, consultation call, come with your problems ready. We need to diagnose it, see how we can help. You'll get some coaching on the call. Like, you have to pick one or build one and just keep at that continuity throughout that. All I mean by that is just keeping through on that thread, naming the naming the call the same thing. Um and yeah throughout. So confirmation page. This is the one that we have used for the last 20ish million 30 million. Um so you're booked for confirmation. What you need to know. We're going to call you. I'm going to go through all these confirmations with you. Um your calls via Zoom. We moved to Zoom 30 or 40 million ago. We will email you and text you the information. Watch this video. Look at these testimonial images. And then watch these reviews. And these reviews are all popups. Okay. So that's it. Now, that page, first thing that's going to happen is they're going to land on that once they book, unless they're with a setter, and I'll differentiate what happens here for a setter or not. First thing they're going to do is get an email from Calendarly with a uh with an actual calendar invite. Okay, so we just have that toggled on. It's the default one. We did change the naming convention so it matches and it like looks cleaner on the title of the event. So, like it'll say Warrior Babe, what or uh you know, whatever company. And if this video is glitching, it's annoying. I'm sorry, but it's going to be the co the company name, brand name, and then the inviteee name, and the sales rep name. Then it's going to instantly push an email from the sales rep. So, we're going to automate that to send from uh for in our case, HubSpot. That's going to be pushed to the confirmation page. So, this entire page, this entire email is framed in a way that's like um congratulations, you made the best step. There are things you need to do. You need to do homework before the call. Go back to this thank you page and watch these videos. Do this and this. make sure you're in a, you know, a quiet place. So that instantly happens. Then 1 hour after that, we begin our brand hammer them content. Okay, so this is Jeremy Haynes. I have more, you know, talks about Jeremy Haynes down here, but shout out to him. He's the one who came up with this or that we got this from, I guess. Um, and he has great YouTube content, but hammer them with content that are essentially reviews, objection blocks, or like pre-objection blocks, and those are on dedicated pages that are just a headline of the objection, a video about it, and then a wall of testimonials. basically. So, we'll send those every 3 to four hours right now. Um, starting one hour after they book up until the time that they have their call. Okay. 3 hours before the booking, the sales rep is we're going to dynamically send from HubSpot again from the sales rep uh a bullet point prep that's like, "Hey, your calls in three hours. Just a reminder. Be in a quiet place. Make sure you reviewed these videos. Come prepared to ask any questions about this, this, and this." And just framing, right? But again, from the sales rep, from the sales rep. We used to have this and I might even made a video on this. I don't even know. I can't keep track anymore. But um where we had all these different emails from the brand, then the person, then a different rep, then an AI thing, and it was just confusing and the person didn't know know where to answer on email or SMS. So, this was a big thing for us is just cutting it down and cleaning it up. Then a 30 minute default reminder on Calendarly that is just like basically looks like it comes with the calendar invite and it's like, "Oh, hey, cool. Reminder of this in 30 minutes." Now from phone we are going we call them the triage team but this is essentially call confirmation and we are going to double dial and leave a voicemail if they don't answer and then SMS which I'll get into but we are trying to connect with them within 5 minutes of them booking a call. So the call comes in booked pushes to a Slack channel in that Slack channel someone claims it one of the triage reps. For us right now, we're using a call center that is uh non US um that works 20 hours a day, seven days a week that picks these calls and dials them. Okay. Now, current stats on this on month, they have claimed 42% of our bookings. So, and of those bookings, those have a 70% show rate. All right. So, the biggest thing is getting the confirmation. So, like those stats always showed to work and have backed out for months and months. What we're finding more and more and I think I go into that in this future changes, but we're talking about doing that inhouse in a cleaner and better way just based on these setter numbers because if we can do it that way, then clearly it'll have a you'll just be able to qualify more and be able to um filter better and have better brand match with having an in-house setter team versus like a call center style. Also, my video is glitching. I'm getting a new laptop when I get to 2500 subs as a reward. So, shout out SMS uh within five minutes. That triage is also going to uh text if they did not hear from them. And we're basically going to say you need to confirm your call. Give me a call back and we'll talk. We tested saying just reply yes, and the claimed rate went like through the roof, but the actual show rates dropped on those claimed ones. So, currently we're just back to notification of hey, I left you a voicemail. I just need to talk to you real quick in order to confirm. And this whole call is basically them just saying, uh, do you know that it's, you know, this time zone? You know what you're getting on the call for? Uh, you do know it's a Zoom, right? We have an older demo. Uh, so making sure they understand that. Again, this whole thing is going to have an overhaul and that's in this future changes section because if we can get it anywhere near the sets number or sets quality is probably a better way to say it because I didn't go into it. The live call close on this is like way higher, too. So, the show and live call, meaning the blended sales we're booking is way higher on the sets, which is hilarious because we didn't use setters for the first 70 million like idiots. Um, then SMS 30 minutes post. This one is 30 minutes after someone uh books a call. Then a sales rep is dynamically going to send an intro that's like, "Hey, this is Ryan from XYZ company. Just wanted to reach out or reviewed your application." And then it's dynamically AI based on their application reads it, snippets it into a sentence or two that's like I see you want to achieve XYZ and that you've tried this like we can definitely help. I'm excited for our call. And then it says uh it's it says basically application information review and then it says based on that I thought this piece of content more or less would be interesting to you. pulls from a database where we have keywords and stuff that are broken down of the different content pieces on the site and resources and it'll link them to a review that's relevant for them based on age, based on what they said in the app. It'll link them to a watch page or like a long form podcast or YouTube of things to try and get them to consume and be on the site more. Okay, so this has worked out pretty well for us. Gets some steady responses and then gets a lot of clicks. The 30 minutes pre we are then going to send from the sales rep. Again, this one dynamically changes if the person is in like communication back and forth. We don't want it to seem like an automated thing because it's coming from the sales rep. So, we'll say, "Here's the link again 30 minutes before." It's like, "Hey, so and so, this is Ryan from XYZ. Just wanted to let you know our calls in 30 minute like excited for our call in 30 minutes. Click on the link here or here's the link again." And then drops the dynamic zoom link. This one super good. We route these all through currently. So, we'll go into HubSpot and then through Alawware as workflows. So they send as from the sales rep's dedicated line so it's easy for them to respond and see the communication in their you know talkawware app they send green though that's a bigger issue we'll talk future changes and then ads for the ad section what's going on here schedule versus purchase I needed to add this to make a point so I have other videos talking about the Facebook portion of this and I understand a lot of the tracking not a lot of the you know creative and messaging and scaling and stuff like I do understand it but I don't actually do it so but the optimizations when we run schedule. These have historically always been less and less. We only honestly have run a ton of purchase campaign optimized campaigns in order to get the, you know, return that we have is from purchase campaigns. The schedule ones, for whatever reason, we've tried the qualifying right now. Now we're trying to clean it and qualify it more and more uh with the financial qualifier back and forth, but overall for us, we have not been able to run schedule consistently to get quality shows and quality backed out closes. Okay, so a lot of these are running on purchase. Just wanted to be clear on that for this. We're trying to figure it out in the model and how we're feeding the pixel data back to get it on schedule, but right now it's on purchase ads. Jeremy Haynes has that hammer them strat which I talked about here somewhere um for the hammer them content. He does the same thing in ads and I'm gonna let him talk about this more and because he crushes it and he has a ton of videos on this so you guys can just look this up but basically you're owning their feed for the 3-day booking window once they've booked or however basically so it's like once they book and they're in your sphere hammer them with stra uh content. So we have like 30 pieces of content in there with throughplay exclusions. So like once they see one over x amount of time, it removes that con them from seeing that content piece and then they only see the other ones. So you're constantly just trying to show them like different content pieces that are pre-objection blocks, uh long form testimonials, long form content, just like anything positive and that could they could consume prior to the call so they just think you're everywhere. So this was a big one for us. Uh I think this alone was five or 10% of an increase in my opinion. Um and then let's get into the future changes. So, future changes. Another thing that a lot of these guys talk about is having a selfie video from your sales rep. So, where this 30 minute post thing exists, um, right here, this would be a good place for us to be able to implement this. So, we just had them all make Loom videos. We had a new sales rep come on that just like was doing her own process because that's the other thing is almost all of this is marketing and sales and the sales rep really doesn't do much of anything uh, in terms of like conversation or messaging or stuff prior unless there's like responses. But like we do all this canned which down here sales rep own it like I've heard that that's not as good to do and we might get away from that but because of how much was getting lapsed which is another issue and all of that like we just took it over in full automations and marketing side of things marketing tech whatever you want to call it. Um so it could be interesting if we could get them to do it and own it more. But for the selfie videos, we had a new sales rep come on that was doing this with a loom that was a canned loom, not personalized, but like, "Hey, I just want to put a face to a name. This is so and so. I'm excited for your XYZ call." And they were getting like 65% shows like off the rip for like the first 10 days of being on the team and we're like, "What is going on?" So, we just got all of them to shoot these in Alaware Talk and the setup we use, you can't send video files. It's like this whole mess and it's definitely holds us back and people don't use their iPhones individually just because we want to track all the messaging which also might be shooting ourselves in the foot. Um, but we are putting them in loom links dynamically sending them and replacing out with this. So instead of pushing them to content, it's going to do an intro based on your application. I thought this and this and then it's going to say also wanted you to put uh wanted to help you put a face to the name and then drop the link. So we're going to see what that does. I think that'll be very helpful. Confirmation page. We have a two different splits right now going of this. I think this is a huge needle mover personally. Um because we are changing it out to have the objection blocks on page. We are changing it out. So the structure of the page is built in a way that's like um basically you know confirm it. Go into your email get this and this is step one or step one communication. Basically all the stuff that we currently have on ours. So it'll say like this section right here. Then step two will be like you need to confirm this in your email. Then it'll be watch this video. Then there's a couple of these, but then it's a bunch of popups and like specific ones with more drawn out content. And the idea all around uh confirming the call, watching it, and almost having like homework prior and then consuming all the uh the having consumption through long form and short form reviews, right? So I think that'll be helpful. We had someone tell us this the other day and I think this is super interesting, but what's your t-shirt size? So people will be like in this text right here be like oh hey like this is so and so from you know whatever company um excited for our call also uh what's your t-shirt size just so I have it and it gets the person to respond and that kind of comes back to this whole like framing and why it's like why is someone getting on the phone are you offering them some bonus if they show up like no matter what they'll get access to this course no matter what they'll get you know a t-shirt if they show and then just doing what you can to get them over the line it's like that oldgie thing it's like just copy is to get them to the next part of the copy It's like funnel, same thing. It's all you're trying to do is get them to the call right now. Once you get them on the call, then you can close them. You don't have to think about the next part. So, this could be interesting for us. Um, Blue Bubbles, I made a whole video on this on how this doubled our response rate on the application not booked AI sequence, but for Blue Bubbles, this could be very interesting. It's just crazy difficult with the tech stack. Crazy difficult because it's like 50 new contacts per day per line, right? 50. Yeah. 50 contacts per day per line and then it routes through different phone numbers if you go above that and then the sales reps have to be inside that platform. But all this is basically saying is like it's them on an iPhone. But we would be able to track and see the numbers and stats and automate things versus uh if they had their own iPhones and were trying to do this. But it worked really well for us on app notooked. Then it exploded on us because of batching and too many numbers and declines and stuff. So like we're still working on this to fix on the app not booked. then we can come back to potentially using it to swap out the conduit of this because that's what we did on the other is like we're sending green bubbles with all this messaging. All we did was keep all the messaging that's AI and then just put it in blue bubbles and we got double the rates of response and all the things. Have a whole another video on that. It's like double SMS something. And then yeah, I already talked about sales reps owning it. So that's the general gist. This frame right here, setters being a big one of this setters are only 200 of these bookings I want to say. Yeah, it's only 200 bookings. So, it's like a low percentage. That's why the average is uh is drawing down. Um, blended for 62. This is like the last 3 days. This is month-to- date. So, monthto date is 50% on this. Month is 72% on this. So, if we can get the volume of these up, fix these a little bit, and these are also going to get better. So, you're going to have quality improvement, quality improvement, and then volume improvement over on these, then this number already is going to be 70%. So just with this stack using setters and having this cook continuously into the right direction. So hope that's helpful for you guys. Let me know in the comments if you have anything. I'm on Twitter a bunch now. So if you have any specific questions on this I'm happy to share. Now yesterday's stats. So yesterday I don't know if you know but Zoom went down right there everywhere. It was like Zoom, Cloudfare, Google, but Zoom was the longest one. So, not only did we So, we like had this crazy good sales meeting. They just started closing units like crazy. They closed eight units or seven units right here. Yeah. One unit here and then seven here. And then Zoom just broke. No one could get on meetings. All the meeting links were invalid. So, every single sales call we had of like 80 sales calls that were left on the day are Zoom links. And our buyer demo is an older female and they couldn't get on the Zoom link. Then you're trying to get them on a phone call. Then they don't think you're legit. Then they're confused why this is happening. Then you have like 10% of them show on the call. Like it was terrible. And then to compound it and make it worse, the calls booked for today now and last night and stuff like that all were not generating bookings through Calendarly and Zoom connection because the integrations broke. So now we're going to feel it today. I already know it. So people aren't going to have Zoom links. You're going to have to message them and try and send them to Zoom link. They're not going to show for it. So just going to be a mess. But yesterday, every day is something. uh eight buyers. We were cooking right here. And this is just good to see because that just means quality is there on the marketing side. Now it's more or less a sales function. It's maintaining on marketing, continuing to get cost down while keeping the quality. And then just pairing it with sales just like sales needs to close more. Um so eight on there, 39 on low ticket. That's feeding really, really well. A bunch of these yesterday and the day prior came from low ticket ascension. So the math on this is mathing and I'll get that update there. And then cash collected was only 42 grand which is just terrible right now. So again that's whatever 1.2 million a month which is just like blood. So yeah we got to get back up to 1.5 to two just to like you know more or less break even. Um kind of not actual but like kind of. And then above that the team's built for two plus. So that's that X Instagram and subscribe. Give me a 2500 so I can get a new laptop and these videos can stop glitching. So talk soon.

# we did $163k testing a "pocket ascension funnel"... here's how. | E35
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaOT_NLFlP4

In today's video, we're going to be talking ascensionbased info products. I had a few people reach out on Twitter talking about ideiation on low ticket offers into high ticket, the structuring of those offers. So, we are going to talk ascension models, the economics versus throughput of those models, cannibalization, not the bad kind, framing our plan, and some examples down here. I promise is simple. It just looks confusing. And then bonus, if you stick around to the end, we're going to go through churn and burn, how we look at this, and how we mitigate this. All right. Then, if you stay to the end, we're going to talk yesterday's stats. I do these videos every single day. So, we'll go through buyers, cash collected, Stripe, general company update. Last year, our women's fitness coaching business did 30 million in cash collected. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same. All I ask is that you subscribe, comment some value that you got out of this, topic ideas, all that, and like the videos you like. All right, so let's get into it. Now, ascension models. This is super super common in internet marketing space, but you can you can use internet marketing in any industry. And I think that's important to highlight here because a lot of people just use this for the make money online niche or internet marketing for internet marketing. And I kind of want to show, you know, obviously we're a health example or a fitness example. Um, but there are a lot of different industries you can do this in. So, a lot of the core ones are going to be low ticket info into high ticket coaching. So that's the example of what we're doing. I have full videos on the channel where I break this down and I'll kind of go into it down below in the funnels. U but low ticket info into high ticket coaching, free community into paid community, right? So like that's a big thing in hormosi style with school and what they're going for there is a lot of people join have free school groups and then push them into paid communities from there. Mid-t info into high ticket info. So these are other there's a lot of different variations of this but example being a 2K auto webinar where someone is selling direct to a 2K webinar that someone purchases and then on the back end is either info or coaching and I'll break this down too but info or coaching on the back end. So you're selling something that's midt 1k 2k uh directly without having to talk to a sales rep and then selling high ticket info or coaching on the back end. And then the triedand-true consulting.com OG that launched a ton of these from whatever that was probably six, seven years ago was mid-t info either direct or through sales call. So a 1K to a 5k product call it then a high ticket ascension from there and then on the back end a mastermind. So like his example was um I think it was accelerator uplevel and quantum. It was like the OG version of this or probably not even the OG but the new age OG. Um, and he was, I believe it was 2K, then 5K, and then like 20 or 30K a year recurring, right? So, that's the old model. Then they obviously went and built school and have crushed it since then. Like, huge respect to those guys. Um, but yeah, so these are some of the core ascension models. Now, what I said earlier with ascension or internet marketing specific, a lot of people are just going to do this in this, but like I my mom's a vegan blogger, for example, and like she has a free community and we didn't launch a paid, but like there are so many people in the space that do that. They have a free community versus paid and it's all about like the differentiation and I'll go through that, but there are so many industries you can do this in and offer creation. Um there's a ton of good groups on this where they talk about it where everyone's doing this in in healthcare in landscape in like just the craziest industries you've ever thought about and applying this there is more so blue ocean than not okay because everyone else is competing over the make money online and like the new angle versus just taking one of these models that exists and putting it into an industry that doesn't have as much uh internet marketing competition. So economics versus throughput. When looking at ascension for low ticket specifically like this AOV versus Ascension or both, what I mean by this is you listen to Russell Brunson crushes it, Clickfunnels guys, right? All that like their whole a lot of their stuff, not all their only, but a lot of their stuff is all about having, you know, multiple Otto's inside of your funnel. So you're going to have your main thing you sell for 37. This works in ecom. This works in uh this works in every industry, but like direct to cart, for example. Um so you're going to run something to a $37 product. Then you're going to have an order bump. Then the next product is going to be 97. The next product is going to be $1.97. All as one-click upsells, onetime upsells, uh onetime offers, OTO, um throughout this process. And you're all you're trying to do is get that AOV up from the $37 it could be if you sold the main unit versus blend it out 30% take this one 20% take this one 20 10% take this one and it goes from 37 to 72 let's just say okay and sometimes a lot higher because people have like $500 and thousand courses on there payment plans recurring stuff like you can really play with this in economics Sultanic he has a group on uh Facebook called Nothing Held Back and they're like pros at this um so a lot of of the content is going to be you you can get a lot of the content out of there. But so AOV versus ascension and is basically me saying if ascension is your focus like it is for us in the model and if you watch our other videos where we are trying to take people from doing one action to the backend offer without with as little friction as possible. So in our example of this we're going to run them to a sales page. They're going to check out and purchase and then they're going to land on a booking page as the Otto instead of offering more things for them to sell because we are optimizing for ascension, not AOV. Okay? And what I mean by that is we are trying to get them in the back end, the highest percentage into the backend product from the front-end product. And we are trying to reduce the time to ascension by putting a call in right there. we're doing with the setter and then going to a closer from there instead of having them just buy the product, get into the community, and then eventually set them onto a call because we're trying to get the highest percentage of them onto a call and have that time zoomed in. Now, that is not to say that we cannot optimize our AOV as well, just not in the traditional way of just having like Otto after Otto where it's 97, 197 from there. So, what we're doing is stuff like order bumps, okay? And that'll be like they're already checking out. Then there's a checkbox below that's this in addition or that's basically in addition. So either like community recurring sometimes people do it. Those are a lot harder I think to frame them. Um, but just like a a recipe book or an added this, okay, cannibalization and how to look at this kind of goes with framing, but a lot of the again back to the anal sultanic thing like the it will be like a done do-it-yourself, a done with you, a done for you in these and that's kind of like this model right here or except mastermind in the back is implementation. So do it yourself just info product. someone logs in, they got to do the whole thing theirel. Done with you, generally speaking, like a group coaching. There is more support in it. And then done for you is like top dollar implementation. We build your entire funnel. We do this whole thing. And if these are too similar, like this one's easy because it's like the style of complete. It's like how someone is completing the service, right? It's like they're doing it themselves with or for. But a big issue with these in general is when they are too similar. They solve the back-end problem in some way and it creates cannibalization. So an example of this is we had that for a long time we sold an info product that was kind of mid-t. It was like a thousand bucks at the time and then we had high ticket on the back end. It was so much information and offered so much personalization both through the content and then through the group coaching that it was cannibalizing the backend product because the back end is onetoone coaching with personalization and all these things and community and whatever but there was so much overlap that it cannibalizes the other one. So you want to have different you like you want to differentiate between those two so that it makes sense for someone to go from here to here or they see the value is probably a better way to say it in the next stage uh of the business or of the of your offers. So some framing on this. My CMO opened my mind to this. There are tons of people who talk way more about this and better like we're just now running this. We have run it in the past but like we're just now running this again. So we're we're iterating on this real time. So this is raw but framing for the continuation of the offer stack and you know they call it like offer stacking they call it um ascension like your ascension stack but more quicker easier than the next natural steps. So more of the same and this works in ecom. You see a lot of guys talk about this. It's like oh cool someone just bought your duck product. It's like next upsell is do you want three of them? Do you want another one for 50% off? Like more of the same. Quicker. How do they get the result quicker? So, um, an example of that is like they buy a info product or a course on how to do this and then there's an o there's either an Otto or an order bump as the next thing that's a quicker way to do it and it's like or do you want just like this three-step way to do it instead of like this big info product that you just bought that yeah, you're going to learn it but it's going to take longer. It's like this is the shortcut. So, it's like people buy those and then easier similar to quicker but like an easier way to do it um is is also very common. So next natural is the main thing that people think about but like this is more of the same or staying within the same messaging alignment. So an example of that is like if you're doing nutrition and exercise as like your core thing right within fitness it's like if you're selling something that's nutritionbased okay they want something more they want quicker they want easier. Yes. The next natural inclination from there in this example would be fitness. Okay. So it's like juice as much you can around the nutrition. Then you're going to the next which is is exercise. It's like the next step. So an example of that like in landscape is someone gets a uh you know backyard renovation or whatever they get a pool. It's like the next thing they want is the landscaping around the pool, right? They like come with it. It's cross cells. It's upsells. And there are so many videos about this. So I'm just sharing like our our frame of this. But so much stuff on YouTube, so many good groups where people only do this specifically. Um, and there are people in those groups that'll do it for like not that crazy expensive. Five grand, 10 grand plus a percentage of it. A lot of them are built around percentage of the upside, but it's like who cares if that's a percentage of the upside as long as your math maths like keep on doing it. Um, we had somebody offer like 10 20k without a percentage I believe and then a percentage plus this for like five or 10k. Um, so yeah, you can get these built for you where these people will go through this entire thought process and just like handle it. Um, so if you already have something going like that's a good play or you can just learn it in those groups. So our plan and examples, we base ours off of like buyer personas slash like interests. So messaging. So the pockets of messaging, an example for us is something like um menopause, macronutrients, uh, mindset, muscle, right? So like those are just four examples. But like again, I'm not the messaging guy. I have an understanding of this and I wanted to launch this and because I understand the economics and the business but to be the person writing the messaging is not to me okay or running the ads. So, pockets of messaging for that example, you're gonna have messaging, you're gonna have an offer, and you're gonna have continuity across those. And then you're gonna have pods. And what I mean by that is this funnel right here, for example, is going to be all macronutrient-based or in a bigger health thing. It's like this is going to be thyroid based or this is going to be um, you know, cleanse or something. You know what I mean? Like you have different messaging pockets that can land and each one of them can individually be scaled up. Now, caution. You don't need three of these to get to a million a month. You need one of these to get to a million a month. You may need multiple of them depending on market size, messaging, all those things. You may be able to get one to three million a month and then need another one to do that. And we pushed ours so hard on our current or our main one that we were just like, keep going, keep going instead of doing multiple. And I think that was a critical mistake. And as you'll see, our acquisition has broken. And we are that's what we're actively still trying to fix. And the future is this. Okay, so pockets of messaging offer continuity pods. Say this is macronutrients. Okay, you're going to have a VSSL funnel. It's going to go through. Our CMO said this the other day. Guy's a genius. Sparks my brain every day. But he was basically saying that you're going to run the VSSL funnel, but you're also going to run the low ticket because the VSSL funnel is people who are already framed. And as long as you have or I'm sorry, not already framed, but there is a portion of them and call it 3% of them I think was his number he used that are already like ready to buy or like in the position to buy both where they are like mentally and like where like their understanding of the problem where they are with themselves. They're already ready to book a call and buy. And then the other ones and where a majority of them would want to come we should want them to come from is going to be through low ticket. And that is both for the economics as well as the framing because the economics get way better. I have other videos about this, but assuming you get it cost you a h 100red bucks to get a $50 purchase uh of your low ticket $50 net AOV or I'm sorry net CPA on that. So cost you 100 bucks, you already made back 50. Now it only you so you burn 50 bucks but that 50 4% of those buy the back end and you flip that on its head and you are in a good CPA range for high ticket um and it's just mass volume and this is like again a time to ascension thing but whatever. So pockets of messaging ascension greater than AOV for us that is our goal. We are going to do things that will increase the AOV but not distract from this funnel. So, right now we're talking only about adding things like order bumps onto here because we don't want to have, oh, and buy this for 97 and this for 297 and whatever at this time because our goal is to get a lot of people on the phone with a setter and then have the setter set with a closer. Okay. Now, what I mean by continuity with pods over time, we've heard about this, we have not done this yet because we haven't had to because we're only running basically one of these right now. Um, you would have a setter call. you'd have setter pods that are dedicated to the different ones because they would be coming in under this detox offer or they would be coming in under this messaging pocket. So having continuity of VSSL they're seeing let's say around this messaging the low ticket they're seeing around this messaging and offer then getting on with a setter that is you know either titled whatever the call name is whatever and they know that the person bought this product which is easy enough to do but like just framing that way so you have dedicated people that are really good at this and then those set with the same sales team that's all one backend and this is where it all comes and connects back is with one sales team we've heard this is okay to do we may have to have multiple sales pods I don't believe so. Um I mean you'll have sales pods because you have so many sales reps but I don't know if they'll be dedicated to different uh inflows. Then from there they buy and then it's the same backend purchase. They're buying the same backend because it is what solves their problem and it is the, you know, the creme de creme on the back. And know your numbers because it's huge because if you don't know your ascension rates on these, you don't know your CPA on these, you don't know your time to ascension, like you could it could flip and you could be in a bad situation. uh if the time two is too long and you have this massive tra uh trough of ad costs, if you're scaling into it so heavy that you don't know your time two or your ascension rate accurately. Um this is stuff we're actively dealing with by the way. So like we're running this and we are getting good stats but it's like how hard can we scale it? Um but we also need to scale it because we want to generate the bookings but we know that only 25% pop out this range. Like these are things you need to know and track. And then quick bonus turn and burn. Someone asked here like how do you sell high ticket coaching without the churn and burn? I have a sticky note on my desk that says everyone is someone because I'm so technical sometimes that I forget that when I'm looking at split tests and purchases and all the stuff that come through is that's literally a person. Um and you need to think about it that way especially when it comes to this stuff. So natural inclination in education and info meaning talks about this in a video recently but basically the natural inclination in educ education info is for someone to leave once they learn the thing right so it's like someone pays whatever for four years of college to get the education to take the classes after they're done they don't continue to pay for college so why would they continue to pay you right for your high ticket coaching so another example of this is within fitness it's very common that if someone gets the results or they don't get the results, they leave, right? So, if they don't get the results, they just are like, "Oh, this didn't work." Even very, very likely that means they didn't do the thing. So, they'll leave. And the people who do get results a lot of the time have learned how to do it throughout a year of coaching or at least learned the the fundamentals on how to get the results on their own. Okay? So, they'll leave. Now, why would they stay? That's the biggest thing. We forever have just offered on the back end of our product just the same thing. And like we do have retention like for sure and we do these internal blasts that are uh disc we do twice a year like 1k off blast to the current team uh I'm sorry to the current current client base um and incentivize the coaches to that where they basically if their people do it they get like a percentage commission on the back end. Um so that's a big one to get people to stay but again they have to want to stay already. So currently our offering has always just been more of the same right this whole thing is just more of the same. it's just another year and currently we're building out a backend that is based around this why would they stay. So a slight price decrease and then really focused around the reasons they would stay and what they value the most after a year after they get to this next phase which is the community which is yes personalization but they don't need it as much one-on-one. Um it is the education and like continuous stuff because we'll do like guest speakers that come in. will do um just like groupled things. Um so yeah, there's a bunch of things within this but this is the question I ask. Why would they stay? So there's a lot of like info marketing ones and it's like that people are in masterminds and a lot of the time it's like why would they stay is like finger on the pulse new things coming out and community for example. So like new thing in marketing, oh someone did this and then also the people in it you're just like you become friends with and you want to stay in. Um, there's a really big one guy who crushes it, Ezra, who does it in uh, ecom, blue ribbon mastermind, and he has like just such a tight-knit community and also runs these big e-commerce businesses that then shares real time like what we're doing now. And it's a perfect example of that. So, it's like what's working now, how we're scaling, what we're looking at this at. Oh, here's this crazy new tool we found for email or using AI. And also like he has like banded brotherhood of people who are in that group that are all like just really solid good people that all hang out and then they have events that are throughout. So tactical part of that um activation points so that's both on the front and the back and then having dedicated retention team. Uh we are testing that right now. We've seen a big uptick in at least like the soft metrics of it. Um and then like I said changing out offers too and having just really getting clear on why they would stay. So, I hope this answered the ideation of creating low ticket into high ticket turn and burn structuring. I didn't really super go into this, so maybe I count on another one. Um, I'm more of a funnel percent math structure type of person, so uh, this one was a little bit easier for me. But yesterday stats, terrible. I I like again I always say this, but like I love and hate that I'm making these videos right now. We had three low ticket buyers yesterday. This is crazy for us. So like we are so struggling on this part. This is a time two part but this is just like breaking for us and honestly what's actually breaking is like this sales process because like we'll fill calendars and then it won't close and then we'll half fill calendars and they'll close eight units and it's like what is going on? So it's this it's this connection between marketing and sales and the consistency around it that we are struggling with because it's not good. This is what 1.2 1.5 something a month like we can't do that. That is not good for us. Um, so yeah, 47 GS yesterday, which is basically the same as the day before, which is not good. But today on Cal, we have whatund and something calls, which is a big uptick. So, we will see where it shakes out. As always, Twitter's popping off right now. I didn't even realize. Might be my second favorite behind YouTube now. Um, but yeah, subscribe, comment some topic ideas where you got value out of this, like it if you like it, leave it alone if you don't. Those dislikes hurt my soul. Uh and yeah, talk soon.

# "made 30m" but i feel like a fraud... here's why. | E34
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVb0wXYdhGg

In today's video, I want to clear some things up and talk imposttor syndrome. Yesterday, I made a video about making your old self look stupid, and I accomplished that in one day. At the end of the video, I was talking about how in the last 30 days of posting every day on YouTube, I had gotten to around 300 subscribers, which I was pretty stoked about. And then last night, I essentially 4xed because of a couple tweets. Now, these tweets are saying, "Made him 70 million. Guy makes 30 million a year. In an effort to stay raw, transparent, and honest, I want to paint an actual picture for you guys. Talk about what these numbers mean. what I did and do within this company and then go through some imposter syndrome stuff. All right, at the end of the video, I make these videos every day, so I'll go through yesterday's stats on buyers, cash collected, and some Stripe company update. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. Everything on this channel is me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people, which is working. And all I ask is that you subscribe, comment with things that you like, any topic ideas you want, and like the videos you like. All right, so let's get into it. So cool guys right here, big in the media buying space, [ __ ] right? And saying that I, you know, guy makes 30 million a year, like that hurts my soul to see and I need to be able to like share this and be raw. Um, because I'm getting major imposter syndrome around this. All right, so like to paint this picture, this company was started before I was here. Okay, so they had already had product market fit. They already had the brand name. They were technically I have other videos where I kind of go more in depth in the offers, but they were selling a low ticket app doing around 30 grand a month call it when I joined the team. Okay, so I was within the first three or five or seven or whatever team members on there. Okay, at that time I was hired to come in and do sales pages and I was literally just doing like a,000 bucks every six weeks. So the team had already started the business. They had already done the zero to one portion, already had all that that existed before I came on. Okay, so I did not start this. It's not from scratch. The team built an insane product. So there are two main founders. One is very marketing sales uh like online marketing heavy and then the other is the brand face expert and crushes it and has like an insane product. Okay. So there's a moat that exists in there between the results that she's already gotten her story all those things. So those two married together already existed before I even came around, right? So like major leg up. So I don't want this to come off as like oh just built this from zero and all of that. Yes, I was part of the team. Yes, you know, pre1 million all these things, but like I don't want it to seem like coming off like I started this. Okay, team does all the marketing. Now, a lot of people in the space are, you know, what's the messaging? How do you do the ads? How do you do all this? Yes, I understand what the messaging is. Yes, I understand the ad tracking, all the metrics on everything like what we're optimizing for, all that stuff. But do I actually write the ads? Do I actually create the ads? Do I actually run the ads? No. And I never have. Okay, so big key point here. We the other founder has always been very very heavy in the marketing space and has always been more or less the media guy when it comes to this company. So now we have a team of actual media buyers and we have a CMO and we have all these things. But for up until 20 30k a day like he was doing the media buying, he was writing the copy. He was getting the creative made. He was auditing the creative all those things. Again I am part of this. I'm seeing it. I'm understanding the strategy, all the economics, all that piece. But like when it comes to the real messaging, I don't do that part. Okay? So all this is to say like the team built this company and I don't want this to ever come off like oh I did it guy makes 30 million a year like guy behind the scene like yes I'm part of the team that did it but to say that I am the one who did it is not really my job. Okay, so 30 million, 70 million, 100 million. What we have done 71 million in total cash collected. That's whole Clickfunnels jazz right here. We're on our way to the third disc, which would be 75 million in cash collected on this specific company. 30 million of that was last year in 2024 in cash collected. Okay, so the three years prior, we basically went from 10 million to 12 million to 30 million and the margins took a dive. So again, guy makes 30 million a year. No, guy does not make 30 million a year. The company overall did 30 million a year. And when we scaled from 12 to 30, our margins dove. We did everything you could do wrong. All I have a ton of videos talking about like what we did wrong, what we're changing, how we're changing things now. And all the videos at the end of the day, I'm talking about how we're doing, you know, 20, 60, 40 grand a day right now, which is not good for us. Like that is not good math because of how big we are. We have 110 employees. We are constantly refining things and trying to get back to like the numbers we were. Um because over the last four to six months, we took like a major dive due to acquisition. So like that marrying between marketing and sales and then you have an entire coaching on the back end. So like back to this whole like team built this company the product it's outstanding and like that's a part that we don't even have to worry about because we have such good people on the team and strong leaders. Okay. So again I did not do this solely. So quick background on what I did do and what I am part of. So like I said I started off building sales pages for like a thousand bucks in this company like every six weeks. Okay. Okay, so we were doing low ticket then we were basically just doing low ticket trying to sell info products trying to sell recurring info uh like community that then had an Otto. I have other videos where I go into the offers when we started this and then I met the one of the founders inconsulting.com inside one of the communities of the product. So I wanted to run a callunnel kind of from the jump. We waited at x amount of time and then around world meltdown co-ish we were like let's just run this like this is how we're going to get to 10 million and so I had already bought one two three courses about this so I built the stack the tech stack around this the VSSL structure I got from one course I got the CRM set up from another course the scripting I got from another course like we basically just bolted a ton of courses together and just started to run this thing live okay so all three of us founders were taking calls so there was probably I don't even know five people on the team at the time seven people on the We were all taking calls. So like yes, I was around from the beginning in that sense, but not in the sense of like the product market fit and the company being launched and the brand name and all those things and like them already having product and results. Marketing and sales is run by someone else more so, but like we're in the trenches doing it all together. Okay. So, like we scaled the sales team, we hired them, we did the group interviews, we led the team like in the OG days all the way up to a million a month um or close to a million a month because then one of our sales reps then became a manager. That all then exploded because you don't do that. We didn't know you don't do that big thing. But so we scaled the sales team and then the team was always handling fulfillment. So at that point it was an info product. So the fulfillment was lesser because it was like a group coaching model. But again all of this is to say is like as we scaled there are essentially three of us, right? as as like the core core like founder owner style thing. So founder one became and is still CEO and is like really strong in marketing and sales. So like overlook CMO does all that portion which is like arguably you could look at it either way but like what's more important is like the product or the marketing and it's like both. But the marketing feeds it the product fulfills on it and continues to get referrals and results which then feeds the front and it's just like this vicious cycle. So founder one as we started to grow leaned into being CEO, owner, marketing, sales, that side of things. Founder two leaned into was always, you know, brand face, but leaned into being expert brand face and product side of things. And even then has since like had killer coaches and stuff that have taken over and like operational roles to lead that team, but like her methodology, her things. And then I was came in as what I was then moved into mainly tech and then more recently operations like directly over leadership because again we have such strong leaders that like COO is just a rough title. I don't really like titles in general but like CTO COO whatever that is. It's like I have built the marketing tech the operational structure the org chart of style or like the operational systems and stuff that we run on. And then my biggest thing is I just find bottlenecks. So like I could tell you what's going on in in almost every part of the company. Fulfillment's kind of like over here and does a lot more of it that has a really strong leader that does a lot of its own kind of it handles a lot of its own stuff and then I'm very plugged into all the new things we're doing in marketing all the new things we're doing in sales all the combination between them because right now it's low ticket it is changing up how we're doing the VSSL funnel it is the connection between them it is the data tracking it is the team requirements it's like all these different pieces so like I'm overarching on a lot of that and all of that and so I run tech simply put runtech leadership and co-own the company. Okay? So, like I want to clear that up. It's not like I built this, I did this, and I'm getting a major imposter syndrome from this because these whole like made and take home and all that are like so different. Okay? So different. Like I just want to be raw and transparent on these and this video is a little bit different obviously um some of the other ones just because they're usually just value packed and just like info. Um but I just want to share this because that is important before you know this channel continues to take off. So made take home like I said ads and marketing. Now how I solve for this like imposter syndrome thing is I have literally done so much in ads and marketing outside of this company specifically to stay up to date feel like relevant understand have a pulse on the market. I've always been plugged into all the different groups like nothing held back. Buying lead genen courses, affiliate stuff, ecom, uh right before the end of last year, scaled up a dog product on a Shopify store as a one product store to like 100k just to like do it. I made all those ads. I did all the media buying. I built the entire shop. I did the entire back end. I did all the fulfillment like as a side thing just to like cure the interest and just feel closer to the pulse, get a pulse of what things are going. So, like, no, I don't run ads for this, but like, yes, I've run ads. Leadgen affiliate. I have a bunch of friends in lead genen that crush it and like I do a lot of the tech on their side of things. So, I'll set up as of recent I haven't, but like I used to where I would set up like lead forms and posts from this to this and like tracking and all these different pieces. And again, like they had an offer where they needed more media buyers stepped in, was spending like 30 grand a day on theirs and they already had the offer. Again, they already had the creative and the assets, but like I was media buying for that affiliate stuff. I've gotten up to five, six grand a day and then exploded every time um with like different affiliate stuff whether it's VSSL like direct to carts or more so on lead genen and all I say is like I'm constantly trenching. That's why I'm I'm just like constantly trying to like solve for that imposttor syndrome and solve for like being able to show up in a way that is valuable no matter what I touch. So like these guys talking about you know byra media and you know money Twitter right now these guys likely spend more money than I do or have on Facebook directly like yes the company spent 9 or 10 million last year we have a Google media buyer we have a Facebook media buyer we have a CMO and then the founder is very strong in marketing and used to spend on it prior to that it's like not me but then I could talk in circles around tracking and uh you know the pixel and how we're setting up this and that and the structure between and the pass through percentages from this to this to this and like I can tell the overarching, but do I click the buttons, write the copy, build the creative? No. We have a creative director. We have an editor or two editors under the creative director. We have a copywriter. Like, we have a entire team of people that now do this. And I just want to be clear with that. I just want to make sure that it is very clear that you're listening to someone who does a lot of the tech and operations and structure and solves for bottlenecks as my entire thing is just problem solving, solving bottlenecks, and scaling. Okay, now let's get into yesterday's stats because then this will paint another picture. Yesterday, we only had five high ticket buyers, which is terrible. We had 54 low ticket buyers, which is on par. And we only did 50 grand in cash collected. That is 1.5 million a month rolling, right? Or are targeting trending. Not good. Oops. What did I do here? That was from the day prior, I believe, or something. See, raw, transparent, real. Um, so 1.5 million is not good. Last month we did 1.6 million. Like that is basically red break even for us, which is not cool. Okay, so last year doing 30 million like it was essentially I mean here look at the chart so we can look at this together. But we were like scaling up heavy already by these months and then had some little blips scaled up and then all of acquisition exploded right here or I guess technically like right here and exploded and we still to this day have not been able to get it fully back on track. These are internal promotions paired with new revenue. So that is like the big uptick here like the saving grace on cash flow but ever since then we still have not been able to solve for it. So now we have setters, we have uh CMO. Like I am so confident in the direction that it's going, but it is painful right now. And it's just kind of funny that I started to make these videos like during this period. Like I don't sell anything. This is not a cash flow thing. It's not like a oh here here's how we did this now like buy this from me. Like I I have no interest in that. It's literally just to show like us in the trenches building make network uh of people doing the same. And yeah, so I hope to share these soon where these are back to good old numbers with 100k day, 120k day. I'll go back to making actual videos that are very valuable and helpful based on what you guys comment on these videos, DM, all of those things. Um, but today I just want to share. This imposter syndrome is real. I have whales following me right now uh on Twitter that likely spend or X, sorry, that spend more than we do than I do, that make more money, that do all those things. So, hydros is valuable in how we think about things. The structure, the tech, the ops, the solving for bottlenecks, like our systems because that's what I could talk about for hours and hours on end. Uh, when you start to get me into this like marketing piece, it's like again, I can talk structurally and economics and like around this, but am I going to be the one sitting there with a, you know, a Sharpie and a whiteboard? Those don't work together, but you know what I mean. And talking about how some brand new messaging from zero to one, like unlikely. Not really my speed. So yeah, that's today's video. Comment, subscribe, DM, all the things. Talk soon.

# everyone wants growth. no one wants this part. | E33
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZhF6ln3EAQ

In today's video, we're going to be talking about making your old self look stupid. Everything on this channel is very data and system driven, but I think I would be doing a disservice to not share a little bit of mindset as it is the overarching thing that covers all of your personal and business life. All right, so by the end of this, you're going to feel good about making your old self feel stupid and you are going to learn how to take your current ceiling and make it your new floor. All right, then we're going to get back into our regular scheduled programming with some data and go through some stats about YouTube and our business. I've been making these videos for 33 days straight and I share buyers cash collected updates on the business at the end of each one of these videos. Last year we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. I share what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 mil. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people who are doing the same. And all I ask is subscribe, comment some topic ideas, things you like or don't like, and then like the videos you like. So, let's get into it. So, like I said, making your old self look stupid. This is I have this on sticky note and I just like always say it. I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do it, but I'm a huge believer in beliefs drive your behavior. So like basically how you look at things and what you believe to be true drives how you act and then how you act and show up on a daily basis is what creates your identity and who you are. All right? And that is in personal and business. So some examples of this is our belief around this is the way to run a call funnel drives how we run that funnel which then creates the identity of our of us as well as the business of this is how this is okay so an example of that right here is I have other videos where we deep dive this but like this is the funnel we've been running forever with an opt-in page VSSL page application book a call get on the phone okay like very simply put last week we're talking to people and I've heard this forever and we have tested it and not to say we But there are people doing way bigger numbers than us that are literally running straight to a VSSL page application and then book a call. And why that's important or an example is like we start to deep dive into the data and when we run purchase campaigns versus schedule, you know, we have such a low opt-in rate that all this qualified traffic isn't making it through the opt-in page and we have all these beliefs around it as oh well if they opt in, they have um a higher intent and they get nurtured more and like all these other pieces that just like may not be serving us well to have that belief. So, we're building out this entire thing that is a different funnel structure than we've been running for the last 70 million. And it was just kind like sparked my brain a little bit and I figured I would talk about it here, but we've held that belief so strong that oh, if you get an opt-in then you can nurture more through email, they're more qualified, there all these things and it could just be completely wrong and our entire economics of our business model could change in a day if we run something new. So, it's just like holding on to that old belief in a month from now. We could look back and be like, "Wow, are we stupid because we just, you know, left 100 million on the table or something, right?" Like that's an example. Posting on YouTube every day will drive X is my belief. And then my behavior is I'm posting on YouTube every day and like that becomes part of my identity. That becomes who we are. Not to say it's right or wrong. It's just like a belief, an example. Lifestyle ego. I could go into this in like a huge other video, but the belief around this is how you should show up with the Lambo and the watch and the parties and the stuff because that's either normal or because that's what means success or whatever drives you to do that behavior all the time and then you become that person who postes the Lambo and does this and whatever. And like of course there's time and place for things especially in like marketer world, internet marketing to like post that kind of stuff and use that as a marketing tool. I personally I no longer like prescribe to that belief. Um I have a lot I could talk about this. Um but yeah, mine has just kind of come down to just being raw and believing that sharing the stuff, the good and the bad is then what I do. And then it creates the identity of like I'm the person who shares the good, the good, the bad, the ugly, and it's just like real and it's not some like show and putting that on. Okay. And then people do change. What I mean by this is like you know you hear the people can't change, people can't whatever. And I do believe people will return back to baseline or to the beliefs or systems or things in their life that are the most like strongly held. But to say that people do not change, I I just don't believe that at all. Like if I look back a year ago or 5 years ago, it's like you do change. Everyone's naturally growing. It's just at what rate did they grow and then what are they actually leaving behind versus carrying through. Okay? Because like you have things that you have protected right here. So like goal is to outgrow your old self, not protect it. there are pieces of you and other people that will protect parts of it uh parts of your old identity that you bring through forever. And I think that's more of what people don't change means is like someone is this way, they'll always be this way. Like you can change that, right? So feeling cringe is growth, not embarrassment. And what I mean by that is like YouTube's a simple example. Like I I'm a month into making these. I look back at the original ones and I'm like, "Wow, these are bad." Um and wow, I can't believe I said this or that or whatever. And like I'm just looking at it as growth, not as embarrassment. And for a long time, I did look at as embarrassment. And in a lot of ways in my life, I looked at as embarrassment. I have things that I have done said like just not good that are a year ago or 5 years ago or 10 years ago that I still to this day I'm like, "Wow, that's embarrassing." But it's not. It I can't change it. You can't go back. So it is I just look at it as growth at this point. Um and just try and act now. So I change my belief on it, then act in a different way and become someone different about that, right? in whatever topic. So, YouTube is the current example, but you can literally look at that in any other way. So, like I said, I can't believe I used to believe act like that. I used to talk about doing, now I actually do. I used to chase dopamine like crazy. Now, I have an agreement with myself that is in alignment with that. Now, this is an interesting one because as I was writing this, it's like you can get caught in the race and I literally think I might be in it right now of like, oh, I'm not doing this and I'm have this agreement with myself to act in this accordance. And that can also not serve you over time. Like if you're optimizing for something that you think will get XYZ and it's not getting XYZ or it's ruining other pieces of your life. Like for example, like I'm doing the exact same thing every single day all day for X amount of time now. And like it'll be interesting to see if the lack of moderation in that direction is serving me in other portions of life. And like right now it's where I'm at and right now it's compounding progress in the business life and you know this which you could consider business. But is it serving other places in my life? like I don't know yet and I hope to look back in 3 months or 6 months or a year and be like okay wow yeah yeah that was compounding progress in this way but then I evolved and changed in this way and growth is allowed is a belief I used to always have that's just like it needs to be this huge big thing but it can be subtle and fast or subtle then fast more so you can be just putting in the reps and see it later what looks like quickly it's like the whole overnight success thing it's like all right we've been doing this business for six years I've been doing digital stuff for like 10 years and it you know it's all at once. So growth periods can be exponential, 12 months can be invisible and then all at once. Um, and what I mean by this is basically like for the last 12 months, for example, like or I guess 6 months or so, on paper, the dollars and the cash collected and stuff has been like the worst it's ever been, right? And I am in the belief though that the 10 small shifts we're making is one massive transformation and then what pops out the other end, it is going to be, like I said, new ceiling is going to be the new floor. Um, you can put a lot of work in and not see it all come out until what feels like all at once. And I'm a huge believer in that and having you know two years from now and looking at you know Hormosi has a lot of good videos about this but truly being able to like expand the time horizon on things from two year to two years from two months and we talk a lot in like this space about like oh my monthly numbers and good reasons for that because people don't have years of data and all that but like that's the example is you don't have years of this under your belt and once you do it's easier to think in that way. Okay. So, I guess it's kind of hard to do from the beginning and be like, "Oh, I'll do this for the next 5 years." Like, you don't know. But making your old ceiling the new floor is a really an operating model of new information drives new beliefs. Those new beliefs create how you behave and those behavior creates your identity. And that currently leads to your current ceiling of 100k a month or whatever number. But changing that around and understanding the business model could easily be scaled 5x could easily do this if with new inputs you'd get new outputs and like actually systemized thinking of it. And then that's what changes your behaviors. That's what changes the result and it just loops. It's very easy to then shift to be like 100k a month versus 250 a month versus a million a month. Like those are all very capable and possible. And I talk about this in other videos like the guruy video, but knowing that people can do it and there's a system and framework likely that you're operating in that the ceiling is probably one, two, five million. Like I I always talk about in these videos the there's two people that I specifically know of that run the business model that do over 10 million a month. So it's like I don't need to reinvent the wheel. I just need different beliefs that then drive the like my belief has shifted but like oh this business model can do this. Then we act in accordance with that and change things to where it would fit that model and where they could scale to that and then that creates the identity or the business as is and person as is that runs the business. Okay. So lean into it. So how you can do this surround yourself with people who normalize it big thing. It's also a reason I'm doing this um YouTube stuff a lot is because I don't have people really directly in my life that like in person necessarily that uh normalize this. I do have people I work with obviously and people that I've like been connected with throughout the years, but I want more of those. That's like a big goal of what I'm doing here. So, surrounding yourself with people who normalize this level of growth um and interest levels, right? Like people who talk about the same things, people who are interested in the same things, who are growing at similar rates or trying to um revisiting things you knew that were true and pulseing them, I think, is a big one as well. Um like I said, the callunnel example, but like what else do you believe to be true or did you believe to be true or do you still I guess that you can just pulse check. So going through a list of like what are my currently held beliefs in everything you know in your personal life in your business life that may no longer be serving you or could be questioned now like there's a lot of things like a tactical example is you know how you operate XYZ system and could it be you know redone with AI or um this is how we structure and pay out this but like you hear because you're at some conference that someone pays their team this way because they get bonuses and this and it's like you thought it was to be true that you had to pay someone 200 grand in this operating position but you hear from someone else that they have been doing this for five years in a better way with better results and they pay their team their person 50k. Like there are different ways to view this. Um but yeah, I think revisiting things that you thought you knew were true and pulseing those is a very like tactical way to do this is listing them out and then questioning them. I heard a really good thing on my first million. I love that podcast. But um the other day I was talking about how they do this in a corporate setting or like a not corporate but like a leadership setting where everyone goes and sits in a meeting and just says let's just question everything and like this is open forum. You can't deny anyone's ideas but like how would you do this if you could do this anyway and they talk about like the business model. They talk about their offerings. They talk about like structure of things. Um and I think that would be like a a very helpful thing to do just self audit and then tracking behavioral changes not just results. I've done this for years, but basically back to this having a new belief, identifying what those behaviors are that would then drive that um or would reaffirm that and track those behaviors out. So, you're going to do this, this, this, this. You know, you're going to I don't think you need to go crazy like 4 a.m. morning routine or anything, but like, you know, I wake up at 5, I deep dive into goals or I do a goal review. I deep dive into uh deep work for the next four hours around this specific thing. And then we do meeting like whatever it is about the actual behaviors you do or the things like checkboxes that you do and then just track those and just like make those there because once you have that belief and you drive it in with behaviors and then once those behaviors exist you'll see the output or not output and then you can iterate. It's like a general system. So not just results if I used examples of the last six months of like how I am and who I'm becoming versus the actual dollars that were collected on the back end it would tell a different story. Right? So last six months cash has not been good in terms of the business in this and way and then like I share all that in other videos but to say that the it's because of the behavior the identity that is becoming I would in current state disagree and I can make a video later maybe about like how I believe that into the future. Um but it's just not the case. So the results are not there yet but it is like the planting crop like portion versus the harvesting and I'm a huge believer in that. So let's get into this. Hopefully that was helpful. Um feel free to drop some comments about this. Um I have a lot of the main like gurus and all those videos um stuff like that that I have gone through all start with this and have a huge portion of this. I'm not a huge like believe not believer I'm not a huge I don't know I don't make it like a big portion of my existence to focus on that kind of stuff. Um I just think that there's kind of like the 8020 on what you can focus on and get the result with. So hopefully this was a bit helpful. But all right YouTube 30-day results. So, I am 32 or 33 days into this, posting a video every day, 330 subs, small, but again, the goal of what I'm going for is like high quality people, not mass market, not zero to 10K guys, not any of that. It's like obviously what I talk about is very tactical and like um probably not that helpful to somebody who is under 100K or 500k or whatever a month. Um, so yeah. So this is like as to be expected and like content with that because that's pretty crazy to me even though that there's 330 people that are likely similar and learning stuff. Um 150 on IG. I think this is the best like method I'm using as tracking. So got 150 new followers on Instagram and like 80 to 100 messages. So these are the real goal. It's like yes subscribers because then it's easier to track on platform but like this is what the real goal is is to network connect and then I already have people who could like be talent. So just yeah could go deeper into that but like talent opportunities and network that's the goal is I want people to message I want people to follow I want to talk to people in that range um so that down the road into the future this can be more valuable in terms of like team and people so here's some stats 338 hours of watch time I think that's low but crazy if you actually think about it that people watch my stupid face sit here and talk about this for 340 hours wild um and then yeah someone else is going to know these better than me. But yeah, some of the top videos are like this guru one. I try to make these all as good as possible or like as real as possible. Not as good as possible, as real as possible. Um, but I have some kid that's in here doing like, you know, spammy or not spammy, cringey titles and thumbnails and stuff. So, I don't know how I feel about it. But this specifically was a little bit more mass market, like 0 to 10k. And I think that's why it's already doing so well. Um, but yeah, I just trying to interweave the realness and like the actual stats behind all these kind of things that we're doing. So, a lot of these bigger ones are doing like a lot better um than I thought. So, kind of like the full funnel breakdowns, the we did x amount and like these total offering things. So, I think that'll be interesting to lean into into the future. Um, but yeah, someone could tell me what's wrong or right about these, but that's that and yesterday's stats and then we will shut up. High ticket buyers four. It was a Sunday. Not good. We had low availability. 54 low ticket buyers 28GS. Not good. Again, we are in the trenches right now and we are rebuilding. So, uh I might stop doing these. Let me know if these are valuable for you. Like maybe I'll just do like a general business update on these. Um I don't know. I mean, I'm not I don't care about sharing the number, but I just don't know how valuable it is or if it's offering anything to you guys. So, yeah. As always, like I said, subscribe so you can get some notifications about these. Comment what topic ideas or what is valuable or not to you so I can tailor the content to that. My goal is to help people who are already doing probably 100, couple hundredk a month and scale them up. Um, and then yeah, like the videos you like and don't like the ones you don't. All right. So, talk

# your LTV is too low... here's how to fix it (exact strategy) | E32
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NekCgJPVOtY

In today's video, we're going to talk increasing LTV in info and coaching businesses. I'm going to share these green ones right here, which are things we actively do in our women's fitness coaching business that did over 30 million in cash collected last year. Orange are things we're actively working on. As you can see, always a work in progress. And purple are going to be things that are moonshot ideas that we aren't currently doing, but could do into the future. Then we're going to drag them down here into the front and back end of where you can sell them in the sales cycle, which is very important. And then yesterday's updates. I make these videos every I believe it's day 32 of doing this and share buyers cash collected Stripe and just a general update of where we're at with our business. Like I said, 30 million cash collected last year. Everything on the channel is what did work, what didn't work, and what we're actively doing to scale. All with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and networking with cool people doing the same thing. And all I ask is to subscribe so I can get some feedback. Comment with what topics you want, any ideas, and like the videos you like. So, let's get into it. Now, I believe this is a Dan Kennedy quote, but whoever can afford to spend the most to acquire a new customer wins. And what this means is just really increasing your LTV because over time, as advertising costs go up and competition and all of that, you need to be able to make the highest dollar value per customer because as your CAC rises, you still need that margin. Very simply put, okay? And the simple ways to increase LTV are the frequency that someone buys, the value of what they're buying. So essentially like the AOV and then the retention is how frequently do they buy? Okay, so frequency and retention can kind of be back and forth and especially in info and coaching, but I'm going to go into that. So this is what we're currently selling. We have a low ticket info. I have all the funnels and all the stuff on the channel so you can see them, but low ticket info. So for us is a $37 product. Now if we just sold this the LTV of a customer would be $37 only. And if we never sold them anything else and if our acquisition cost was 30 bucks, we would only have $7 margin across our entire everything. and we would go out of business because we're not even selling them for 37. And that's where the customer acquisition math comes in. Because for us, let's say it costs a $100 to get that $37 customer. We know that the LTV of that customer is actually 10 grand. So the spread on that is fine. And how long does it take to get there in the trough? Okay. So $37 info product that then ascends them up into high ticket coaching, which for us is $7,200. Again, on the channel, I have videos going through all these funnels and math and all of that. So, high ticket coaching and then high ticket coaching renewal. This is literally the only ways we make money right now, which is not good. Um, but I'm I'm going to show this like we had a huge conversation about LTV brainstorm last week and I'm going to go through all what we're rolling out. But what this model looks like is you're selling a ton of low ticket. So, you sell a 100 low tickets. Of those 100 low tickets, call it four of them by your high ticket uh coaching program. And then after year one or whatever the term length is, one of them renews. Okay, so you have a 4% ascension rate and you have a 25% renewal rate. Now, backing into that math, call it I can't do the math on that quick, but let's say it's five grand. That math may be completely wrong, but call it five grand. And your cost to acquire customer blended is a,000 bucks. You have a one to five return on ads, right? Great. How long does it take that that cycle to hit? The renewal dollars don't even hit until the second year. So, if you're actively spending on ads and you have to pay your bill, like not the vibe. Okay, so that's what we're currently doing and our acquisition or our new rorowaz has not been the best over the last year. Like when we scaled to this 30 million, we went from 10 or I believe it was 12 the year before it was like 10 then 12 and 30. And this is what broke. Our acquisition tied with our LTV broke because we're not selling them enough things. We're not retaining enough and our ad costs and acquisition costs were increasing and we were not the smartest cookies and yeah, so we're here now. So what we are actively talking about and trying to build out is rec recurring low ticket info and community. So what can people pay $50 a month, $100 a month and continuously buy, right? Because then over time if someone pays three months of it, the LTV is $300 on that person. What is your churn on that? All these have their own math. Graduated high ticket coaching. So this is something we're actively like building and I think is going to be live this week. So, as of now, when someone is complete with the program, call this 7,200 or 7,000 that they pay for the first year of coaching. On the second year of coaching, we just say, "Hey, do you want another year of the same thing?" And obviously, like a more beautified sales process and approach, but overall, it's more of the same. So, they're just renewing just as is. They're getting the same coach, they're getting the same idea, they're getting all of that all for the same price. And actually, for us, it's $1,000 less. So, 7200 than 6,200. Okay. Okay, so that puts them in the whatever 13K bucket. We have customers that have paid us 28,000 30 something I think or maybe over 30 now. We have some customers. The average is not even close to that though. Um so what we're talking about doing is rolling out a backend like graduated product because this is fitness specific but a lot of the time with fitness and horos says this half the time I feel like these videos I could just I should just say go watch hormone videos. He's like a huge part of my info diet. So, but in fitness, people who get the result and don't get the result often leave after the term. So, someone who gets the result and has the info and education, it's like the hard part with info and education, which is I guess a little different than fitness, is somebody gets the result or learns the thing and then they leave. So, unless you have something else to teach them or you have other reasons they stay, which is a big part of where I'm going to go here, is they'll just leave because they got the result they wanted. They paid their five grand for this, they got it, and now they're off to do the next thing. And if you don't have anything else to sell them, which is a big issue that we've had is we're not selling them enough things even if they ask for it. You know, we're referring things out more than we're selling our own thing. We're selling things of our own. Okay. So, what this looks like is group coaching style model for us in fitness. Um, you can do a lot of different things like internet marketing and masterminds and backends and stuff like that, but for us it would be group coaching. So, instead of paying 7K, it's like a downell but in continuity. So, they'll be paying 3,000 4,000 a year to then be in a group. So they keep the community, they do keep accountability with the coach, but in a group setting because they don't need the onetoone personalization stuff as much anymore, but they can still get it from the group, but then fulfillment for us drops from this to this. So the cost to fulfill on this as well as then obviously the cost of the customer cuts in half. So, as long as you can lock in the margin because another hormones comment, but he always says I think it's uh GPLTV. I believe it's like the gross profit LTV because what really matters is if we sell another year of something and we have 0% margin on it or I'm sorry, yeah, like a zero margin on it. It doesn't matter if we sell them more things. It's not actually contributing more to overhead or or to the bottom line. So, in this model for us, we would have lower fulfillment costs and we would be collecting less cash instead of charging them the same amount and having less. So, we got to come up with the math on that to where it's 10% um in in fulfillment costs because we can do it one to many with a group versus one to one. So, the cost structure would be better. So, this one's going to be huge for us because right now our retention is not as good as it could. We also had this huge issue where we were using external financing that actually was allowing 24-month financing on a 12-month product, which is like so stupid, but we had that for a long time. So, we have to like weed through those um because right now they'd be paying two for one. So LT uh low ticket add-ons and order bumps. Right now we're selling this low ticket info and it's $37 straight. We have no order bumps and there's a reason we don't have Otto's because we're trying to get them on a phone call which is the actual Otto. It's like the call to action is to book a call. Um, so that inherently like leads to the ascension, which does increase the LTV, but actual just add-ons and order bumps could get this to a $50, for example, offset $10 to $20 depending on, you know, how much these order bumps are uh of our low ticket unit economics, which would be huge. Supplements, um, for supplements, we've tried this in the past with partnerships and it hasn't worked for us. We're talking about how to do it. It's a whole another business to run in itself, but adding supplements is an MR, right? Because they're consuming. It's a consumable that's recurring, right? So, they're buying it and they're continuing to buy it. So, as long as the margin's there and it makes sense, it's just how much time is it going to take us to devote it? And we've tried this with partnerships. I made a video on this. Great company. It the business like the deal just didn't work well between us. So coming up with something there um for supplements would be huge for us because now that we're doing more volume with low ticket instead of 500 400 500 customers a month with uh high ticket coaching uh which to us just didn't make sense because it's more of a volume play. It's a it's a recurring volume play I guess. And then uh now it might make sense for us. And then partnerships isn't just a doozy of one because it's basically what else does your customer purchase andor what other business has your exact same target demo and how can you bridge those? So it's like an example terrible example but like Medicare beauty spa like someone who would have a 40 to 60 year old woman in there as their target demo. Who else would that be? And who else could we refer out business that we could make a,000 because that they're willing to pay $1,000 customer acquisition for us to make an intro or for us to get to to get a new unit for them as a new purchase. So, this one could be huge. We just don't really know and we want to protect the brand identity. Uh, and we don't like to do any like the there's other there's a ton of other things I didn't list on here like selling data and like splitting lists and doing all that stuff. I don't jive with that. Like I I like our brand as is. So, we're doing that. But software, these are the moonshot ideas. Software right now, we have them use a couple different softwares that are like on the marketplace that we technically could build ourselves, but that in itself is a huge business. Ask anybody like to have your own software business would just be a nightmare. But the LTV and the actual business itself could be a lot more scalable, higher margin depending, and then also exitable. So that's like an interesting thing, but it would more so be an offshoot. These purple ones are things we're not doing right now, but are interesting. um clinic add-on. This one actually is kind of orange-ish, but there are other people in the space who do this with high ticket coaching. Say it's five or 10 that you pay for the first uh year of coaching with the with us. You could pay 12 or 15 and get like a clinic like uh dedicated I don't want to call it a doctor, but like a dedicated like health facility add-on where you can get all your blood work where you can get all like the testing stuff done. Um that would be an add-on in partnership. So, it's kind of like a hybrid of these and this because it's like an add-on to that. So, like I said, order bumps are an add-on to low ticket. There are other things you could add on to the high ticket coaching like a clinic add-on. We just again brand is super important to us and like quality. So, we don't want to just like bolt on to somebody that doesn't work because we kind of did that already and didn't love it. Inerson masterminds and events. This is what already everyone in internet marketing does for their LTV. So a lot of the time these are recurring high ticket 30 grand a year and then you get to go to in-person events and a mastermind. So for us inerson events I could actually split these up because inerson events we could do it's the structuring it's the management of the event. It's the cash like cash collection of it and fulfillment of the actual event that is the hard part of that and it's probably not that big of like an LTV boost but maybe because it likely would be included in the coaching and if it was an added thing like that would be a whole another offer structure and masterminding just doesn't really work for us because there are people in fitness there are people in a ton of internet marketing who do this who's like that's their whole business model it's like teach them the thing have the higher ticket coaching thing and then it's like oh Excuse me. You ascend into the mastermind and then you're at XYZ level and it's like new information. It's like what's hot now and just steady doing that and these crush. I just don't specifically see that working in like 40 to 60 year old women for our business model. Um especially when they're all in different places and spaces in life. Like there are fitness companies that target a specific demo or like business owner or stuff that it would make sense to have a mastermind because they can bond over the fitness. They can bond over like the lifestyle and then they're all entrepreneurs or like high performers. So they can all talk about that. You can have speakers that come in that are all about that, but for us it just doesn't really make sense. So now let's rank these out into where you can sell them. So low ticket info, obviously front end, high ticket coaching, we sell as a front end. A lot of people would put this on the back end uh from this. So like I guess this is both because for us the funnel literally looks like low ticket to high ticket, but we're selling it in both. High ticket coaching renewal is a backend thing. Recurring low ticket info and community. This is it might be a downsell for us actually like on on the back end if someone wants to stay in the community after they've paid for the high ticket coaching because that's what they value. They want the community calls. They want to see the people like they've made friends that might live in both. This is why it's kind of funny. Graduated high ticket coaching. This is essentially this but the group coaching offer. So that's all backend. Our sales manager is talking about selling it on the front end but we don't want to use it as a crutch. So not right now. Low ticket add-on. These are in the part of the front-end funnel. Supplements could be both, but that's like a whole different game because you could go direct response and do it heavy there. So, likely for us, it's just going to be like a backend included thing. Partnerships is always going to be backend because we're not going to run ads and sell that on the front end ever. Software that also could be a front or back, but we're going to put it on the back end because it would be our customers who use it, especially like in the beginning. clinic add-on that is technically in the is going would be an add-on direct to here. So that would be in there and then inperson events and masterminds would be back end. So as you can see this one we're going to put right here just so you can see like what I mean by this. So front end, what you're actually only selling and what the entire acquisition model is based on is mass amounts of low ticket and high ticket coaching generally through like VSSL call funnels and then all of this is made on the back end once you've acquired the customer for the first time with these as your core front end. And then again these are like clumped together. But that's the model. Um and we don't do a good job, right? You see how much orange of this there is like we are leaving tons of money on the table by not selling them more things when they even ask for it. Like swag is a great example. I should have added that in here. So swag, I guess that's green because we do have it. But we have failed on doing swag like nine times and finally we have one that works and we make no money on it because like it's just not a part of our business that we were trying to make money on and never would. And like we don't have the volume to do it. So, we'll make like, you know, $4 a shirt or something after shipping and everything, but it's just like a storefront that's there, but they ask for it to the level that like they'll make they'll do group orders of their own like custom.com shirts until we had our own because they love the brand so much and we weren't providing that for them, which is not cool, right? Because that is an LTV boost. It's small, but it's a big but it adds. Um, same with supplements, all these. So, that's our general gist. Appreciate you guys sticking around. Yesterday, eight high ticket buyers, 75 new record right here on low ticket buyers. This number is low um for us based on the calls. We were over I think it was a 12% sales were booking though, which is good. And then cash collected only 50 grand yesterday, which is not good, right? That's 1.5ish trending for the month. We need to be in the twos at least to be like okay and then three plus to start scaling and like making into our heavy profit like we did last year. So, all this is a gentle build back. Um, low ticket's crushing and the ascension rate is hitting. So, I'll do a video update on that. But yeah, um, like I said, subscribe on these. I need to know that you guys are into these or not, or I'll just stop doing them. I'm just trying to share some value. Comment, uh, that's where this video topic came from. So, if you guys want to comment any uh, topic ideas that you want or Instagram message them. I always leave that in the bio. And then yeah, like the videos you like and then leave the other ones alone so I can see which ones are the good threads of what kind of topic points. So talk soon you guys.

# did $71M with this simple CRM setup (full breakdown) | E31
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBKjX9yo5hI

In today's video, I'm going to share how you can build a simple CRM setup for your info and coaching business. A lot of people over complicate this. I'm going to show you the very simple way. Looks a little confusing, but it is not. I promise. We've done 70 million in cash collected through this structure right here. And I'm going to go over kind of the high level what's going on here, some of the details in here, and then what really matters is how you can make better decisions for sales and marketing, how you can close more deals. All right, if you stick around to the end, I make these videos every day and I'm going to share yesterday's stats on leads, apps, buyers, cash collected, all the things, and go through some updates. Last year, we did 30 million cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. I share everything on this channel that did work, what did not work, what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million. No ego, no fluff, no nothing. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of cool people who are doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, first things first, the idea behind this is structuring your data correctly so you can make better decisions and that you can track things and all that, right? Like very simply put. So, this is how we do it. Not to say this is the exact way, the right way. 19 people are going to comment and just be like, "Oh, no. We do it this like any there's a million ways you can set this up. I'm just sharing what we have that has worked for us and it has evolved many times." Okay, so like this is where we're currently sitting with it basically. Um, so we'll go from there. So, first things first, we're in HubSpot. Now, the root of this for an info coaching business, this is for high ticket and low ticket. I'm going to show you in here for us right now how we're tracking both of those inside one. But the root of it essentially is a contact. Okay. Now, over here, you're going to see the objects. This is HubSpot's like the different types of data you can store in different objects. So, you have contacts, companies, leads, deals, tickets, all of this. Today, we're going to talk about just contacts and deals. Okay? So a contact can exist which is one person technically a contact or multiple contacts to can exist for a company. We don't use companies because we're going B TOC but if you're going B2B you would have a company you could have mult multiple contact points inside there. And then you can have deals that are assigned to a contact. Okay? So one contact can have one deal, one contact can have many deals, right? So today we're just going to talk contacts and deals. We do use tickets. We do use some of these other pieces in here. the messaging, the the the invoicing, the activities that occur on a contact. Like you can go really down a rabbit hole here, but I'm just going to share today how we do this. Okay, so to start contact, I tried to segment these in different colors and you'll see kind of where I went with this. But very simply put, you're going to collect name, email, phone, right? You're going to have all the contact information you have from them at the contact level. Okay? All of these for us are going to be prefed with Zaps and you're going to use your CRM as your source of truth. The idea being you want to put all of the information that you have about a person that you collect over time into one centralized place so that later the more data you have the better as long as it's structured correctly. Big key here. Um that you can then use that to make decisions that you can use that to see trends. You can see that someone did this and this and this and then bought and then you can see that 50 people did that and like oh that's an interesting new flow. Right? So contact info. Now, at the contact level for us, you're going to have a contact owner, which is constantly going to be changing. Okay? So, in the beginning, they get assigned to an SDR, let's say. Then they book a call, which creates a deal. The sales rep is assigned to them. Okay? And it's changing there, but we're storing the history of what happened. So, you're going to have an STR owner. You're going to have a sales rep owner or uh yeah, SP sales rep owner, a triage owner, which for us is the call confirmation team. Then, you're going to have a CS owner. I put this one in here, but this is all going to be about marketing and sales. You can technically do entire operations and fulfillment on here, but this video would be like 45 minutes. So, I'm just going to do sales and marketing. Now, this is the fun part, the part that makes the most sense to a lot of people. So, for the data that we're collecting, these blue are going to be date fields that we're storing. Okay? Well, date and information fields that we're storing. So the contact owner, like I said, is constantly going to be changing as they move throughout the funnel steps. But what we really want to be able to do is track the funnel steps, when they occurred, how they occurred, and when they re and then when they like reoccur, when they happen again. So for example, everything is about how you structure your data. So for us, when we originally built this, it was like update, app date, like all these things down here. And then as you scale and you have so like 01 right here is offer one. So when you have split tests and all that, those are going to exist within that funnel. But the second you want to have like a completely separate dedicated VSSL funnel, you're trying to push like apps into here and bookings into here and like you're you're blending your data in a bad way. You're bet you're like blending it in a way that people are getting the wrong emails because they're in this funnel, but they should be in this funnel. So we identify this with like offer one VSSL, which is different than offer one low ticket. Okay? So offer one uh VSSL stage. This is going to be your optin. Your app is for high ticket VSSL call funnel. Okay. Um optin app booking purchase right is like the generalized flow. So here you're going to store that in basically drop- down fields. So it's going to be like which one are they at? All of this inflow when the action occurs update this field. Now this is important because as this is happening you're also putting them in here with the date. So, for example, today's April 12th, 2025. Let's say somebody opted in a week ago. They opted in on April 5th. We're going to put a date field in here. Two days later, they applied. We're going to push the uh app date the day that they applied. They then booked a call. Same day, booked the call for 2 days from now. We allow bookings out 48 hours. And that's there. Okay. Now with that data you then have we're going to go into like how you actually use this in in CRM and and technical side of things um or to make decisions but you're storing this as you go across. So then you can see how many went from here to here. How many are in which stage and then you can use these to then trigger automations and do all that. Okay. Now same thing with low ticket. You're going to have dedicated ones because these all occur at the contact level. You can technically do this like it's all about how you store your data and how you want to query it. Like you could do this with other pieces of these objects. Like some people do this as a deal and like mark it across. We do it at the contact level because it's what happened with that one person at what time. Same thing for low ticket. So you're going to have for us three page three stages are an optin and a purchase and then everything leads to a backend purchase. Okay. So because we only have one backend purchase is actually just technically just backend purchase not 01. Um, but we have 01 VSSL, 01 low ticket and the different flows to get that back in purchase. Now, as you collect more information, this is just an example. There's like 900 things on here that I just didn't want to list just to show you how easy just to show you the simple version of this. You're going to fill in the app answers and you're going to map them in so that on your sidebar, on your whatever, your sales reps can see all the application information that came in. So, I just put app answer 1, two, three. We have like 16 questions on ours. So, you're going to fill in the app answers. And another thing that you can do is then be able to go, okay, so people who answered this on the app. Now, this is so easy with chat GPT. You can just like export all this with all these fields once you have the data in structured correctly and be like, okay, like what was a similarity in app answer one if it's free form or you know how many people said yes here that then ended up closing versus no here or you know like did these different things. So, you can do your own data analysis once you have clean data which is the biggest part. Okay, so these app answers. Now when somebody books a call, we have it create a deal. Okay? So for us, a call is a deal. Different people do this different ways. For us, it's that. Now, like I said earlier, a contact can have many deals. So simple example of this is when someone buys our low ticket, they are then pushed to book a call that we're calling an implementation call. That implementation calls with a setter. So that creates a deal that has the assigned owner uh the deal owner as the sales rep, I'm sorry, as the setter and then has its own stages and outcomes. When the setter is on with that person on the implementation call, they then book one in with the closer. It creates a new deal. Okay? So now you have two deals for one contact. So you can see the different deal the different calls that have many deals were generated in order to get a close like all these different pieces as long as you store all the data. Okay. So, getting into deals, same information. You're going to have name, email, phone come over. We're going to have deal owner, SDR owner, SP owner, and triage owner because all of those four occur on a deal. On the setter deal, you're not going to have an SP owner. Okay? But in all of your data tracking, you want to know how many deals came from a setter. You can easily go how many like of my deals right now, how many SDR owner are known. Okay, now that you have that, now what are the deal stage outcomes? at what percentages across there. So you can see that the ones that have a setter known have 40% uh or a 80% show rate for example versus your marketing leads that do not have SDR owner known have a 30% show rate right so like you'll be able to see this data once you store the data clean now other pieces that are stored within a deal that are different than in a contact you're going to have deal stage right and we'll go into that one this is like a important one deal pipeline you're gonna have different pipelines for example when I said the setter deals setter deals live in a setter pipeline closer deals, live in a closer pipeline. There's a bunch of stuff on fulfillment. There's different people on the uh different setups on that, but simply put, deal pipeline can just be that deal amount closed. Update this. These can be required. So, deal amount is required when marking that closed one and making sure that the values are correct because then that this is actually a portion of what we're going to then pass into the Facebook pixel for uh through Cappy for the purchases. terms link dedicated terms link that makes it so we can f uh pass it into uh Facebook's copy the same way set source this one for us is a new one and pretty cool so basically it is for SDR so like once SDR owner is known you then have to set a set source so for us we're using auto set and set source or I'm sorry and self-s set so auto set auto set is when we book these implementation calls direct with them on a calendar 15-minute widget then they like create the deal on their own then they set from there the other one is if they do the classic set which is like dial 100 get five pickups get one set whatever the math is. Okay. So because we pay different commissions on that that's all tracked in here automated out into sheets and into trackers that then we can do commissions as well as see outcomes. Right? So self set versus auto set. What are the show rate differences? Right? What is the close rate difference? What are the automations that are then connected to it based on this versus this. Okay. And then same thing app answers. We carry that over so that when a sales rep gets on the phone or gets on a Zoom right there, they can have the deal open. They can see all the application information at the deal level. They can also be on the contact level, see all that, see all the communications, see all the emails they've gotten, everything. Okay. Again, this is the very simple way to do this. And there's a million other ways to do this. It's just the way that we currently have a majority of this set up. Like I said, there's probably like 500 other contact fields in here that are like either hidden or whatever. But deal stages. Inside a deal, you're going to have a pipeline, which I should also have another arrow out here that shows like four four or five different main ones. Deal stages. You're going to have call scheduled, no show, cancel, deposit, which basically means they take $100, I believe it is right now, to secure their spot. If they rescheduled, if they became a hot listing, which means they're going to close within a month. Long-term nurture is more than a month. DQ is different than close loss because it just means like they cannot afford it at all. Um, different people do this at different levels. A lot of people DQ at the lead level um which still works. We actually pass it back through once someone sets that as the outcome. Close loss means that they could have closed but they did not based on the sales rep. Pending approval is uh essentially just closed one but they need approval to move to close one because we need to make sure that all the fields are correct because as soon as it marks close one, it does a ton of automations. It pushes into CRM, I'm sorry, into uh into like Cappy into pixels. It pushes into channels. It pushes into like all these places. So, it lands here before it gets management approval to closed one. Okay. Now, a lot of information right there. This is really simple. I promise you this is simple. So, you're literally just storing data. You're storing as much information as you can. You're making sure you have HubSpot team information on who own which owner is what. You're storing date fields for when they achieved a thing. This is extremely important and I didn't really go too deep into this, but when somebody comes in like 30% 50% whatever the number is of your opt-ins, mainly opt-ins, it'll happen at other stages, but people will do it like a secondary time. So, they'll opt in for your funnel and a month later they'll come in and they'll reopt in. The issue with this setup, and other people have better ways to set this up, I'm sure, but the issue with this setup is it'll overwrite their opt-in. So, your date ranges that when you start to like try and pull data are wrong in the future. So what we do and this still actually is going to happen with the setup but what is going to happen is they get removed from automations in a different way. So for this you we have this so it auto clears itself every 14 days if they haven't moved out an action so that it's always basically like a a fresh slate. We actually for opt-in have it like three to seven days, but it removes them from this so that they can then re-enter and still get all the automations fresh versus if they opted in a year ago, they go to opt in today, the the automations won't trigger because it's like, oh no, they already opted. But this can control that because you can clear it out so that they're at ground zero and then re add the opt-in field that sits there for two weeks or whatever and then uh re puts them in the sequence because maybe you change your emails, maybe they just didn't even open the first ones, right? So that's important. Now, how we use this to make decisions and automate things. So, these are the four core stages of the VSSL call funnel. Okay, so you're going to have your opt-in date, you're going to have your app date, you're going to have your booked date, which is different. So, booked call versus booked four. So, 48 hour window, they booked on April 12th, they booked four, April uh 14th, and then the back-end purchase for our high ticket program. Now what you can do once you actually have all this data in here stored is you are able to use this for automations and then for data. So for automations you're going to have your push to apply when your opt-in date is known but your app date is unknown or does not exist. Right? Very simply put then when this triggers your unenrollment occurs because it no longer matches the enrollment criteria. Okay. So you have those two set up on top. People are in the email sequence. As soon as it flags that they hit the app, it pushes them out of there. There's a million ways to do this. You can just do auto removals. You can do when they do this, do this. Like this is a very simple way to put it though. So you're sending them all the push to apply. Then what you can also do once you have this data in there is you can have a count of how many are at each stage. You can have a completion percentage. So you have 30 apps, but you have 100 optins. So you have a 30% completion rate or a 30%, you know, next down the funnel uh step. And then a big one that a lot of people don't track but is like pretty native to a lot of these but is time to. So what is the time from opt-in to application that occurs and then you can go what is the time to to purchase from these different stages once you store the data and once you're updating the fields inside the CRM okay so same thing here once someone goes from app to booking you're trying to push them to book as soon as they book you pull them from all this but you stored all the data and then push them to show which is like the call confirmation email stuff like that and then push to close this is just kind of like the more literal of what you're doing um but you're going to take them from here to here and And then you're going to show you can also get the count the completion percentage and the time too. Now beauty is this you can grab these three for all of this. So like how long does it take someone go from an app to a purchase on average when purchase is known. How long does it take from go to an op to a purchase from a deal create uh from a contact creation which is gen which is generally this an op to a booking like these are very interesting numbers once you start to gather a lot of data. Um because your sales cycle could be like 16 days on average and you don't even realize that once you start to do volume. Um or you'd be like okay cool. So on average a booking to a purchase is actually for us like 3.6 days. So like that's a lot of follow-up as a percentage right because if the call was in within 48 hours that is very limited amount of those or the the average is being swayed out from that first call booking window. So it's like okay follow-up calls it's you know thinking about it have to talk to a partner. So you get all this data and then you can go back and try and solve for it. Now for low ticket, very similar thing. Someone's going to opt in but not purchase. It's a two-step order form. So we're going to capture that. We're going to capture this. We're going to have email sequence and uh text I believe because I believe we collect phone number on this right now. But um push them back to the low ticket to purchase. Then same thing, how many of them opted in but did not purchase? What is the count? What is the completion percentage? For us right now it's like 55 60%. What is the time to do so? Okay. So if the automations are working, this may be extended out a little bit further. Like you obviously want it as fast as possible, but like what is it actually? And then purchase to implementation call for us once someone purchases, we're trying to get them on the phone with the calendar uh or on the phone with a setter. Uh so that is an implementation call that is booked. So what is the counter percentage that do this? For us right now, it's like 65% of this. So you have 55% of people who opt purchase. 55 60% of them then book an implementation call. And then I just dragged that up here because what they're actually doing on the implementation call is setting them with a closer up here. Okay, a lot of data, very heavy. Oh man, I'm 17 minutes in. So that's the general gist. Um I any question these are meant to be conversational. So like any you have any questions on you think I could be doing better, please like I'm total open ears, no ego. Like this is just how we've had it structured over time and it has evolved. Um so Instagram for uh DMs, comments, anything like that. And then obviously yeah comments below of like any topic ideas. Let's go through yesterday's stats real quick and then I will send it off. Uh yesterday leads 715 apps 141 calls uh oh that's not right. Calls yesterday was 78. Right. Yeah. Yesterday 78 calls generated on day and then 10 high ticket buyers which is beautiful to see. Um, this is still low for us, but like not low for us as of recent. We have been in terrible times with like twos and threes and fours, and that's when we lose money. So, this is back up into the okay range. Okay. Not at all good. Not like heavy profitable. Not any of that. Um, 62k is only what 180 uh 1 I'm sorry, 180 1.8 million a month, which is like not good enough for us to be able to be making profit and scaling in. Um, but 71 looks to get buyers is very interesting. So, we're leaning heavily into this right now. Um, I'll do another video later about us updating on this, but like the stats are good. Very good. The net CPA is good. The ascension rate, uh, or the move to low ticket call rate, the sales show rates and close rate are all like in alignment, which all says what is the ascension rate? How many people bought the low ticket? How many people bought the high ticket? That math is working out really well for us right now. Um, so we're going to lean into this heavier and see how that takes for time. Cash collected. 62,800. Okay, not great, not terrible, right direction. Better than 30k days, but not better than our 150ks and 100 and whatever is steady. So, that's what we're getting back to. Um, and then yeah, last thing I have on here is just like what would be valuable. So, I just am making these videos with whatever comes to mind and some random comments, but like comments on these videos, likes, shares, getting these out so I can understand what is helpful. Um, a lot of these videos I feel like as of recent have been like, oh, this big number, this big number, this, that, and like we're trying to do that on purpose to get like the views up, but like also share the no fluff, the no like just trying to be like authentic and real about these. Um, but I just want to be able to provide value and just share what we're doing. And again, not to say that it's always right or wrong or whatever. It's just it just is, right? It just is what we're doing. So yeah, comment anything. Let me know if you guys have any other questions. And I'll talk to you soon.

# we "made" $70M... here's the profit (not what you think) | E30
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5d_8zDB-UA

In today's video, we're going to get transparent and go through info and coaching vanity metrics. So, the difference is when someone says, "We made 70 million, we're valued at 70 million, we did 70 million in profit and we took home 70 million." All these mean different things, right? So, we are going to get transparent and go through the different ones, what feeds into each one, and then I'm going to go through some exact examples of our numbers here across all of these. All right, if you stick around to the end, I'm going to share yesterday's stats. I make these videos every day. So, I'm going to share the different buyers, cash collected, all the things. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected. I share everything that did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and network. So, let's get into it. So, this is huge in make money online space info market just in general. And the biggest thing is like saying we made 70 million like we're doing that right now, right? I'm throwing these videos up and saying we made it. how what I mean by that versus what somebody else says and means by that can be completely different. And then some of these are just like non-negotiables. Like this is what that means. All right. So, we're just going to get straight into it. Um, but I just want to clear things up for everyone on like what a thumbnail or title or whatever. I have a kid designing and writing mine. Sometimes I cringe at them, but like is what it is. So, valuation. First off, almost nobody has a valuation in info coaching, whatever. Like the they always say like, "Show me the LOI. Show me the letter of intent. show me the actual like wire transfer that you got purchased. Um because there are people who have sold for 2 million 10 million like Hormosi I wouldn't I don't want to like categorize them as info and coaching because there's licensing when they did the gym launch deal but that was like 50 something million of it. So there's like deal structures and all this type of stuff overall to say 99.9% of info and coaching businesses especially the ones like you hear about do not sell. They're cash flow businesses. Okay. So that's the first thing. Um but an example of somebody who does have valuation is right? So like they just raised the last round like 800 million I believe was the last one um with like Bane Capital and like money transferred moved hands right like there are multiple ownerships like it is a VC style company info and coaching does not generally get into that realm and in order to do so we I could talk about this forever but like what would we need to do for example in order to sell 92 different things that we're not doing now right and like that's a whole another ballgame most people don't say like oh we're valued at right but this is a big one revenue so People will say we made. I like this one because it's like it's kind of vague. It's like we made you made what? Like you took it home. You did it in total payment plans. You did it in cash. Like what is the number? Um so revenue is going to be as an example you sell a $7,200 product. Okay. Now you have two different payment plan options. One of them is $4,100 today and $4,100 in three months or $297 for like three years. Like people do different crazy stuff. But when you say someone will be like, "Oh yeah, we did a million last month in revenue." And what actually happened was everyone signed up for pay plans. They collected 40% of that cash upfront. And the goal is like that they are going to collect the other six, you know, the rest of the million over time throughout payment plans. So you have like collection issues sometimes like you there's there's plenty of issues that can happen with that where revenue is not real dollars. Like ideally you can pay your bills with revenue but you can't. You pay it with cash on the cash collected side. Okay. So, like this one's a little gray area. Um, I don't even directly like we do in our books, but like I don't even directly track this in any of our stuff, but I'll go through some examples down here. Cash collected, this is just like real cash that came in, right? And there's actually things that come and pull down from this, but cash collected is, you know, the stripe you see, right? Like Stripe doesn't show the revenue that you had and like invoice. I mean, I guess it could in other screenshots and stuff of like pending invoices and all of that and future pay plan MR stuff, but like cash collected is cash collected. So when I share we made 70 million in ours um so like this is 30 million 30.5 million in cash collected of last year, right, of 2024. So like this is money hitting the checking account kind of kind of right. it is that you had however many thousands of customers at 3K a pop or whatever. Like that's the money hitting. Okay. Now, another quick thing on this is timelines. So, like I just said, we did 30 million last year. If I make a video and it says, "Oh, we made 70 million." 70 million for us is what we cash collected of all time so far, right? We're at like 71 almost now, I believe. But, um it's all time. So, different people will be like, "Oh, yeah. we did like this is how I made $25 million or um is a big difference between last year we did four million like that's a different thing so for us last year was our biggest year 30 million cash collected but in total we have cash collected through that stripe account 70 almost $71 million okay next cash collected now this is huge because fees are big and refunds depending on how you run your business are big so for us we have like a lot of refunds that we have pushed through so we are extremely liberal about this and if someone is not a good fit if they join and get buyer remorse and you know you can't have like a simple win back anything charged back doesn't even matter like we're just like get out of the community get out of the product here's your money back goodbye okay so fees you pay on the way in so whatever your number is 2.7 3 2.5 depending on what you pay for your processor so fees going in and then the refunds you have money going out plus fees again to go back out so this is actually like a pretty high line item for us so call it like 8 to 10%ish ish depending. Um, and this has just gotten better for us actually over time, but like we have literally refunded like 5 million bucks, maybe a little more. So, like cash collected minus this stuff is huge. Um, same thing with when you pay your sales reps, same thing with when you break that out. Gross profit, contribution overhead, whatever you want to call it. This is direct cost. And like different businesses and tons of different industries and like sectors use different things here, but essentially it's like your cost of goods. It's like what directly happens. So for us, let's call it just fulfillment costs. So on average, you're going to pay your coach in a service style business under 20%, depending. You have group, you have one to one, you have all these different things, but like call it 20%. So if you did 10 million in cash collected, like on average, you're going to have 20%. And that's the crazy part. It's like some people, okay, so it's is it off revenue that you're doing the 20%? Is it off cash collected? Is it off of net? So like these different things mean different things, and you need to know your numbers for that. Um, so 20% goes to a coach or a, you know, community manager or whatever. Like that's high, but like it can be it could be lower obviously, but that's usually what is included in direct costs usually. And like you could justify at some level being like, okay, well the sales rep is on the new side and it like was the cost to get and like Hormosi uses an example of that. Like what did it cost to acquire the customer in total? It was like and and like what was the total number of contribution overhead? The total number of contribution overhead is cash collected came in, you paid ads, you paid a sales rep, you paid a sales manager, um, and you know, it's going to cost a thousand bucks or whatever or you know, 15% of that cash to a coach to fulfill on it. And it's like after all that, what number hits the overhead for the rest of the company for or for like the admin side of the company that then after that hits the bottom line? Okay. So, like you can kind of put these in different things. It's like an income statementish. Um, but like what breaks off as you go. So, not a ton of people are using this metric and just being like, "Oh, yeah, our contribution to overhead." Like, you're not going to hear that in YouTube videos or like thumbnails, but it's a thing. Tacos. This is a fun one or a funny one and shows in a ton of different like buy business online stuff. Like it's a it's a metric in like the online investment bankingish style thing, but it's basically it is total advertising cost of sale. So, it's new rorowaz more or less. So, it's like if it cost you $3 to get a sale for $9 new, not including recurring, active, whatever. I mean, total advertising cost of sale is going to be like the total blended of the whole company. And like people use it versus new versus all time. So, like just make sure there isn't there's a known thing there. Um, but why I say this is because traffic sources acquisition like that style uh can completely swing this. So like you have to objectively look at a company or a person or what they're sharing and be like and understand that. So like Iman's for example like his is so much organic that yes he pays a team and like production and all that but like in terms of per unit acquisition through ads. He like doesn't really have that. So he's like oh yeah I did 70% margins or whatever on 70 million. Like that's insanity in comparison to like our model because we're almost all paid ads. So someone who runs with, you know, a low tacos um is going to have more money that drops to the bottom line because they spend less on ads per acquisition if any. So like the organic guys crushing this and it's good to know when you're watching somebody who's cranking ads, us as an example, I'm like, you know, I'm calling this out versus somebody who has this massive organic following, they're going to drop more money to the bottom line. Makes sense when I say it like that, but like sometimes it doesn't. So net income profit, this is just basically everything down to the bottom line except taxes. Okay? So your company brings in 10 million, does all these different things, and after everything is paid except your taxes, you have a million bucks, and that million bucks is what you pay taxes on. So people will say like, "Oh yeah, we did five million profit." And like that question is like, "Okay, cool. Was that ever? Was that last year? Was that last month?" And the other thing with like months and years and quarters and whatever, a lot of people are going to talk in monthly numbers, which is like all good and dandy. You can you can talk about whatever you want like I don't care but it has nothing to do with me. Uh but monthly a lot of the time is more volatile. It's also makes sense for like newer companies like or newer offers. So you know you're like oh yeah we did 200 grand last month. It's like okay we might only be six months in or maybe you're two years in. And so I say, "Oh, cool. We made 70 million in cash collected or we made 70 million, which is kind of gray area." And I understand that, but it's like we did 70 million cash collected, not revenue, not profit, right? And it could be taken as that and I understand that and that is the line I walk. Um, but the net income take-home profit could the the monthly amounts vary so much and a lot of time they don't have a year under the belt or something like that or two or five years or whatever. Um, so yeah, just a quick note on that. Now after that everything but taxes then falls into partners. So a lot of the info and coaching guys this is not relevant for because they don't have partners or maybe they have like a small growth partner like our example we do. We have we have multiple of us that are in there. So if your company takes home a million bucks it gets split in the examples I'm going to use here is half which is not our actual model but like I don't want to share our partners' numbers because that's not fair. Um so piece of the pie is like okay cool you guys did a million bucks. Now each person is then gets their 500 basically as income to self or their company that breaks out or whatever but let's call it that take-home after that number taxes big big big so you'll see all the guys living in Dubai u you'll see people living in inside the states and different in inside the United States in different states based on like income brackets so like you know the no uh no state income tax states your Neadas your Florida's your Texas stuff like that I lived in Puerto Rico for the last three years so I had 4% corporate tax and no and 0% distribution or whatever like personal. Um so on every 100k or million or whatever like on every million you'd only pay 40,000 in taxes which is also vague and not true because you have every fee in the world and this and that and percentages and you pay yourself and you pay yourself normal on that and then there's other stuff that bakes in but like it's obviously way less than if you're living in the states um or other places in the world. Canada. Example, the Dubai guys pay I I don't know. I saw something the other day that said it was nine now on corporate, but I think it's 00. The US it's difficult to do uh without like renouncing citizenship to do the whole full bore thing. That's like 0000. I'm not a tax expert in the slightest. Uh all I know is the model I did was go there and pay 4% tax and then plus my fees of like licensing and find whatever like all just random fees and CPAs and things. So take home taxes. So you could have two partners where one lives in Puerto Rico and one lives in the states and the differences there are vast on what they take home because someone could pay 40% tax, someone could pay 4% tax and again fees and stuff but like just quick call it that. So like if each if there was $2 million in profit and you 250 and the partners were 50/50 each one would get a million to the top line of their thing then after that one would walk with rough numbers but 600k and the other would walk with like 900k right? So like vastly different on how you decide to then handle things personally and thereafter and I'll quick run through these because then all these are personal lifestyle. So like in my example it was like oh cool I make I get to keep that extra that 30% spread call it over that time that I live there. Um but then lifestyle wise it's just like what what you want to do. So like lifestyle could be as simple as like no this how I want to live my life. Um so like what are you keeping after your life? So your cars, your trips, your whatever. you live like a DGEN and you're an idiot and you go to the casino and you go to Vegas all the time and you get bottle service and you, you know, lose and you do whatever. Like I could I I need to make a video on this one day, but like you can burn cash. So again, you have your two people, they both just paid taxes. One kept more, one didn't. One lives like a simple meager lifestyle. Hormone always talks about this like being strategic and like you know driving whatever car and like who gives a Just like play the game. but the flashy and the whatever and the losing stuff and the drunk and the what like you add those in there and it's like oh cool you guys are back now to the same number. So lifestyle is a big one and it also affects the work side of things but don't need to get too into that and then investments other sources. I just thought this was funny because it's like okay you just brought home a million bucks you can pretty easily turn that into 1.1 if you just don't touch it and the other I mean after lifestyle let's call it but like you also can can nuke it in half if you're doing any of the crypto stuff included. Uh you can also nuke it and cut it completely in half. So, let's get into some real numbers here. So, I think I might have to delete this whole thing so you guys can see it. But, all right. Valuation right now, we're like $12 is a joke, but like it's like $12. Like, we're right now, as you see, if you watch any of these videos in the past, like we hit 30 million. We're down right now to like 1.6 to two depending on the month right now, which is not good for us. The profit on that is not good. uh because the team is so big uh which is not good. So we're scaling back up but like from going down from not having MR from not having proper structures from keyman risk from like all these different pieces like there's no value like there's people in the space who yes I guess who would buy us and you know the most valuable thing is our like brand and the customer list and like data more so than it is the actual operating model and like that's on us. So, like I said earlier, there's like 92 things we have to change. Acquisition structure, the the key risk on one traffic source, one offer, like just all of those things are not good. So, we are actively working on these to be transparent, but like $12 is a joke. Um, revenue, we don't I don't have this number quick and I just want to make this video quick this morning, but um on the 70 million that we've cash collected, which this is legit. This is actually like 70. Let me do an exact quote. It is 70 stripes being slow. So yeah, like revenue as 72 million for example on for us all time 70.97 million in cash collected. So this is whatever this 79.97. So revenue we don't have a ton of pay plans right now. Like we do and then we also have active clients that are going to renew, but you don't count that as anything on here. It's like that's future potential cash collected or future potential even like revenue. Like it's just not even on there. So 70 million on that. Like I said, now I start to just get into like rough numbers on purpose and not even accurate numbers and I'll show you where because I don't want to this is not mine to share um of other partners and like incomes and stuff. So of that again this is across all time not monthly not whatever but like net cash collected on that based on fees and refunds and whatever call it 65 million could be even lower depending on your fees and refund structure. Gross profit on that say you're paying 20%. you have an info product, that's a course login or whatever. It's like basically the same number because there's no fulfillment cost other than a community manager and some stuff. You have a coaching team, you have a physical product, you have like any of that stuff, like this number flies down um on that net income, say ads, everything else that like funnels in there. Let's just say these are all like hypothetical now. 15 million in net income, okay? Across however many years in range partners. In this example, I'm saying, okay, if you had two partners, so 50/50, they both hit 7.5 take-home, this is, you know, 30% roughly. Someone would take home 5 million, right? In this example, lifestyle, they spent a million bucks, they've got, you know, four million after that. And that's not that hard to do. Spend a million. Not saying you should do it because it's also easy to spend 100 grand, but it's also easy to spend a million if you're dumb. I have been dumb. And then investments. It was just kind of a joke, but like you could cut it in half real quick with crypto or something. And then you can also just like steadily grow it. You can buy real estate, you could do all the right things. So that's just a quick gist of like what people say and what they mean. There's a lot of real guys in the space like the Emans and the Hormosis and whatever that like actually talk about these things in detail. And I, you know, there's only so much that's verifiable, I'm sure. But like they talk about it in the right way or the the way that I view it as the right way that's just like legit versus like we did 5 million last month and you know 3 million of its pay plans or not even legit or you know it's an affiliate that gets 100% commission on the front end which is three million of it. Like there's just all these different things. So yeah that's the today's video yesterday's stats. Let's get into it. We did 735 leads on our VSSL call funnel for our women's fitness company. 173 apps, 88 calls booked on day, five new units. Not good for us. Not good at all. We need this number to be like 10% uh like basically at minimum to scale harder. Um so it should be 8 to nine on here and we didn't do that. 61 low ticket buyers. We're selling low ticket right now. That's scaling into or ascending into high ticket backend. 61 units which is higher for us. I think our record's 63. So, we're already on track this morning. It's like 6:30 in the morning, but looks like we're going to beat this uh beat our alltime record today. Uh cash collected 41 grand. Not good. That's 1.2 million a year average or I'm sorry, 1.2 million a month averaged, which is not good. At 1.2, we are breaking even slashlosing money. Um so, we are in like rebuild mode hard. Still have been. It's kind of funny, but like since I've been making these videos, we've basically been in that train. And I'm just excited to be able to look back and be like, "Oh, wow." Yeah. like thankfully we were there. Um so careful who you listen to. Don't listen to me when it comes to oh you know these guys do 80% margins and whatever. Like I'm just sharing what we've done. Sharing where we're at raw. Uh and hopes to be in these videos being like okay cool. Now we're back to 100k a day. Easy. Then we're up to 200. Then we're up to 300. Like that's the goal here. Uh and I don't know how long it's going to take but I'm going to try and do it quick and correct. All right. So Instagram for communication. follow, message, anything, any feedback you have, comments below, the shares, the likes, they help the algo. I see that when you guys like and share on these, um, they do perform better. So, talk soon.

# we did $70m with 3 simple offers... here they are. | E29
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUs83urL4Ds

In today's video, I'm going to do a full breakdown of the offer and funnel that we used to hit our first 100k month, million-doll month, $3 million month, technically almost $4 million month, and our plan to hit $10 million a month through offers and funnels. All right, then if you stick around to the end, I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I make these videos every day, and I share real no ego, no fluff, what we did in apps, calls, buyers, cash collected, all of that straight from Stripe. Last year, we did 30.5 a million in our women's fitness coaching business. I share everything on this channel to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. So, let's get into it. So, to start, this was seven, eight years ago. And to be blunt, I was not on the team when this was launched. So, I came onto the team when this was already kind of in progress. It was doing, I don't know, 20, 30k a month, something like that. Um, and I think they had had a couple bigger months, but I was not on the team when this happened. I joined at that point and was really in this process is when I was there. So they had already found product market fit but they were selling a low ticket recurring info product. All right. So OG days this was I don't Yeah, like I said seven years ago probably. So price was a $27 a month app that then was a $147 lifetime Otto. Okay. So it was this is women's fitness. So 40 to 60 year old women. At that time it wasn't even fully fleshed out that that was the age bracket. It was more so the messaging was in alignment more so than it was like a demographic specific. Um, so it was weekly recipes, weekly workouts, weekly group call, Facebook community, like the classic online app that you see now. And like there's tons of influencer ones that just cross this model. So we were just doing Facebook traffic to a two-step order form, meaning that it was this crazy long sales page. Yeah, that's probably a better way to say this instead of order form, but crazy long sales page that would then have them put in name, email, phone, whatever. Then they'd click and it would open like JavaScript open for them to put in the payment information. And so you had that drop off rate where you could then remarket to them, right? Because you're going to get a higher completion rate on the first part. Um, so we were selling this for $27 a month. Um, it was actually a 7-day free trial to So it was this actually if you want to be exact. It was a 7-day free trial that then turned into $27 a month with a 147 lifetime access. And I think it was 147. I think we tested 167, but I cannot 100% recall. So yeah, that was this then a lifetime Otto. It was like a 40% take rate. And the biggest issue with this model was the acquisition cost. So we were not optimizing. We were not smart enough. We didn't understand the economics well enough um to both get the ad cost down to the rate they needed and also have the economics within the funnel to where this AOV made sense and the LTV like got bigger. We're also not selling them anything on the back end. So like the the whole model was just broken. So we said, "What do we want to do?" And we were both in Sam Ovens's Uplevel Consulting. That's actually where I have other videos about this, but that is where I met the one of the co-founders. It was inside that group. So, I made a video about this the other day, but talking about how courses and all this kind of stuff and like there's so much value in them, even just in the community and people you meet. So, we moved to a call funnel that was essentially opt-in. This is hilarious, but opt-in to a VSSL page, VSSL to application, application to booking page, booking to success, and then get them on the phone, all that jazz over here, and then purchase. Okay. So, what we were selling though, and what the actual offer was was a info product that was kind of the classic OG day of group coaching. um full just massive product that had whatever 50 hours of content or something that you could navigate through that was everything from mindset to unique body type to the nutrition and exercise and like all of this basically like a do-it-yourself with the group coaching element added. Okay, so we initially had built this out, they actually had built this out again before I was even there, but they were not actively selling it. Um so we decided to spin up a call funnel. I have a bunch of videos uh talking about like how we learned this and where we learned it. But we were selling it for 497 lifetime access. Okay, which was again things we just didn't realize at the time. So future call or future collection, what was the ascension? You know where is the money in the future? What else can you sell them because it's lifetime access and you have like lifetime fulfillment. So $4.97 on the phone which is crazy because again economics 497 for the phone on cost per call. It made sense at that time, but then quickly transitioned to $9.97 on the phone and then 1497. So this and I wish I had the stripe pulled up. I actually do somewhere, but the this is where we started hitting our first million dollar months. Okay, so we got up to about a million a month and this was close to co-ish. This was like midco. Um I don't even know if I'm allowed to say that on here. So if I get cancelled uh or demonetize or something. So the million-dollar month was about two or three months of this and then we were kind of just like in lol around like 800k to a million because it's just massive volume, right? So it was this plus like 297 a month pay plans but it was do your own uh do it yourself info product with three times a week coaching calls group coaching and a community. Okay, so pretty basic. And the beauty of this was your real costs were just like a sales rep and your acquisition cost because the cost fulfill on this is like sub 1%. like it's very extremely nominal because you have a community manager and then you know generally speaking the expert which is the other co-founder um who crushes who's like the brand face and all the ads and then was also doing the product side at this at this point um that's the only cost and that just comes from distributions on the back. So this was the basic funnel. We were stuck around this range. 900 things happened in the background around this time and building out and needing sales reps and onboarding and offboarding and like infrastructure. That is when we decided to move over to selling high ticket coaching and we use the exact same funnel to do it. We use the same VSSL to do it. We literally just changed what we offered on the phone. Okay. Now when doing that the price of this went from this a,000 to 6,000 a year which now is 7200 a year and we have different like pay plans and stuff. All these have different pay plans but like this is the general gist. So we moved to high ticket coaching. Now the volume dropped and technically at the time we were able to sell both which was got to become like it worked while it worked but then quickly became confusing and new reps ramping and which one do they sell and then people just leaning on this one when this is really the better offer with all of the results all the testimonials are coming from this because as we all know in info you know 90% of people don't even log into what they buy which is crazy um so high ticket coaching moved into this direction what that was for us and a version of this still today is onetoone coaching. So we have a coaching staff now of 70 plus I believe 6570 um they do onetoone coaching with the client. So 4,000 active each coach will have 50 to 75 uh dedicated babes or clients um one-on-one coaching weekly check-ins which are like a form so they can do macronutrient adjust adjustments exercise adjustments different lifestyle things monthly check-in calls which are done via Zoom team huddle calls. So basically all of the clients that are under uh or working with a specific coach. So those 50 to 70 that are with a coach all do a monthly check-in call together. Um team huddle, I'm sorry, monthly check-in calls I said are there. And then team is that that huddle. Uh community calls. These are weekly I believe right now. And this is with either different experts. This is with the brand face and like main person. This is with uh different coaches and different specifics. It's like an education or like topic specific. Um a Facebook community. We still stay on here for Facebook. other people move or community still on Facebook just because it's our our demo is 40 to 60 year old women and it just makes sense versus having like a dedicated site with a dedicated login its own zone for the community aspect but we do that for the app access. So like we use we just white label over a current one we want to talk about building out our own but yeah so they get access to this which will have all their exercise meals stuff like that same funnel when we hit 3 million and technically we hit like 3.8 eight. I want to say it was like 3.7 something. Um, and that was with an internal promotion, but also new cash uh as a majority. So, yeah, that is where we hit. Then things fell off the rails. Went off the rails bad. That's where we're currently at. So, this was summer of 24 um that we were up in this range. Closed out this entire year of 24 with uh that 30 million. So, this is the year of 24, 30.5. But, as you can see, we're coming into the end of the year bad. And like this kick right here is our internal promotion month. So we technically do like an a thousand off external. And then we also do a um internal like 5k extend do another year. And that rate is crazy high which is great because that means the product works and like reviews and results and all that kind of stuff are in. Um but that was what a big kick here was which was great for cash flow but not great if you looked at the math on the new units. And we knew that right because acquisition went off the rails uh like right here. Now why did that happen? because we did this because we just took the exact same thing and just tried to jam more through it which is not the move. Okay. So, we should have hired a CMO. We should have done what we're about to what I'm about to share for the plan to 10 million when we were like in these buckets and we started to see the acquisition cost climb on the cost per unit and we didn't. So, we are feeling that today and you'll see that in today's numbers and like still trying to get back on track and like we are not back on track yet. Everything in the data shows that we are going to be but what is actually output is still not back on track. Okay. So 10 million a month. This is what the goal is. This is what we're actively doing. Low ticket info plus high ticket and midt coaching. And I'll get into this. So low ticket. Right now we are selling one of these uh one product, but the goal is to have multiple. So it'll be right now it's a $37 thing. No order bumps, no whatever. Those are all being developed, but it is course access. It's community uh and then it so access with like 19 bonuses and that are in there. It's just like tons of value, insane value. Things that we have sold in the past but we don't anymore. Um the community same Facebook group community we have a free one that is like anybody people go in the VSSL funnel in low tickets and then we have a paid VIP or like coaching one. So we have two groups and then an implementation goal. This is with the setter and right now this is like cranking for us like I think three or four of the units yesterday came through this funnel flow. The next is the exact same thing on the back end. Okay. So we're now just selling this as a I don't want to say like Trojan horse, but like an ascension play to get them into the main program. So that's what the funnel is here. So same thing we introduce DQing and all this. We can do routing and put best leads with best reps and then also so we can throttle to make it so the um calendars can stay at the optimal rates and also allow us to toggle or route to low ticket. I have other videos where I go way more into this. I don't want to bore everyone and just say the same things over again. And then what we're now talking about is group coaching style. So this exact same model. Not sure what we're going to sell it for, but how we would do this in to start a retention capacity. So that's why I'm saying mid ticket here because it'll be lower than this high ticket. Probably not much honestly like maybe half, maybe more. So like 4K a year, 30, I don't know. Uh depends on what we can back into our fulfillment costs and figure out. So the margins locked because that's the biggest part of this. Like we keep people for LTD. Yes. But we keep it for LTV. And I think Horoji calls it like, you know, grow like customer lifetime value, gross profit, whatever. It's like that's what it is. It's what is what actually hits the contribution to overhead portion from this retention. Not just, oh, cool. Let's sell them something for 10 grand, but it cost us nine grand. We only make a,000 bucks. It's like we might as well not sell them anything. I mean, not actually, but sell them something. We would rather sell them something that is, you know, going to contribute more to overhead. So, this is an interesting offer that we're talking about because all about 10 million a month is getting the economics right across the entire funnel. So, it's the acquisition mainly right now because that's where we broke. That's why we went all the way up to whatever 3.8 or something in month and then dropped down to 1.6 last month. Like not good. All because of acquisition that marrying between marketing and sales. But now doing this model, we solve for acquisition or uh the economics around acquisition. So, if we can get this to 4% 5 percent, we are like in the money. Four or five percent is like a $1,500 CPA for a $7,200 product. Uh, and that as the main AOV AOV right now is like $6,900 monthto date and it's the 10th, which is like good, good, good. So, if we can get the CPA down like that and have a 5x on there and basically lose 50% on the low ticket, then we're in the money because that math maths. Now then introducing this on the back end to start and putting it in place where uh the people can stay but not for the same program. So basically like oh in fitness and a lot of things actually like info and stuff it's like once you get to the end it's like you even if you got the result or like learned it or you did not you leave and figuring out something that is like a what is important to them. So the coaching portion is it the community portion is it the um you know uh comm I guess deeper into the community. So like being actually on with all the other people who are doing the same journey. Um stuff like that. So we're thinking about how we're going to offer this, roll it on to the back end, see where we can get our churn too on that. And then maybe this becomes a front-end offer on this middle level for the sales call portion. Maybe not, but this is a general funnel. I have this in other videos, but same funnel just with DQ. So based on the application routing and then the low ticket runs its own funnel, but is also included on the middleback of the uh main VSSL funnel. Now, another thing we're talking about in testing and we see everyone doing like there are people in fitness, there are people in all kinds of things that literally just run a DTA, so like a direct to app page that is a headline, a VSSL, and an apply button. And like we've always done this, and we were talking about this yesterday, we're like just because we always did it doesn't mean it's always it's the right thing. Like when we run purchase optimization campaigns, we get like 6% opt-in rate on this page. We run a schedule optimized campaign and we get like 50% opt-in rates, 40% optin rates. It's like, okay, well, it's clearly trying to do something, but we're gating 96% of the traffic, 95% of the traffic right here. Um, so yeah, this might be just like a stupid thing we've been doing forever and we don't realize. So, what we're talking about doing now is testing this. All these are just continuous tests. Like these are running tests. We're scaling low ticket right now because now we have availability and it's starting to back out. We're at 3 to 4% on this. I could do a video on an update on this when we're deeper in the traffic here going to uh direct to apply. So headline, VSSL, application, testimonial, whatever on page with no cookie CTA. So someone can literally land on the page, watch it, and apply. We're building a complete new application that is more um qualifying so that when because the volume you'd assume is just going to go up. So you need it more qualifying so that only the good ones make it through to the booking. a total frame that's like this is step one of step two or step two of step three technically and the next thing is book a call like do not click this if you're not ready to book a call because then we'll have this is a higher completion rate let's say 70% right now it's like 40% from application to booking um then the ones that fall off you have all the CRM stuff you have all the setters you have all there and then they land on a success page that frames the call well and then it's really you know all of this it's where do we include setters sales all that um or technically we go direct to a sales call so that's the Okay. And the beauty of this is this is like one we need to nail this first and then once we nail this with VSSL and a load ticket essentially in like one pocket or one messaging. So like let's call this like macronutrients for our example. Then let's dial it in. Then you can dupe the whole thing and make it around menopause. You can dupe the whole thing and make it around um metabolism. You can make it you know those are kind of similar but you know what I mean. So like there are these different pieces in there that now you can break it out. So you have low ticket product that's optimized and I'm huge about optimization. So like leaning way heavier into the optimization first, but um have one that's in that niche or messaging, have another one. So you have a VSSL and a low ticket, a VSL and a low ticket and they feed each other and then everyone just falls into this backend group uh into this into this backend product offering. So yeah, that's the gist. That's the plan. Yesterday's stats. Let's get into it. 674 leads, 134 apps, 69 calls, six uh high ticket buyers, 51 low ticket buyers, and 44 almost 45K in cash collected. So that is not good. Um so again, this like keeps the lights on barely uh when we're at these numbers just because of how big the team is. So day prior that I shared in the video, we had done 53. Um but things are looking good. Uh things are looking really good. So, how the marketing changed and like what they're learning uh with the newer team that's in is like understanding that the purchase traffic is way better. We're doing all of these tests, all of these are still in the in pocket of like now they have booked calls to the setter, then they land on a closer and can purchase out. Um, so yeah, so not good in the short term, really good in the long term based on what we're building. So, we'll see. You're going to be right here if I'm going to do we're going to scale to 10 or we're going to scale to zero. So that's that. Uh Instagram for comments and messaging communication. Drop comments on this, like it, do all the things. I like when these get shared out. I think it helps the algo. So yeah, talk soon.

# bought every guru course. made $70M. (watch this) | E28
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip-SqRXU7bk

In today's video, I'm going to share how we went from zero to $70 million in cash collected from buying courses. I've spent literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on gurus, courses, masterminds, everything you can think of. Everyone shits on it. I'm going to tell you why I think they're wrong and what I'm calling the bottleneck and interest mapping. So, we're going to go through like a third of the courses I could find that we've purchased and then show in these black boxes the ones that were absolutely pivotal in my career, the business, all the things. Stick around to the end. I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I do this every day. So, we're going to see the leads, apps, calls, buyers, and our cash collected yesterday in our main business. And last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. I share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and network. All right, so let's get into it. So, like I said, I I can't even fathom the dollar value that I've spent. I know it's over 200. I don't know if it's over three, but it's close to. Um, and I just always do this. And and what what I mean by bottleneck and interest mapping means like where I am stuck, where we are, this is like a cheat code. So people are going to like [ __ ] on gurus and talk about how it's, you know, just like I it's not good when someone is teaching something they don't know or they're making money by teaching someone how to make money and like it's this like vicious loop, but for somebody who has done something, who is an expert in the field, who has the exact track record of somewhere where you were and you need to be like it just it just makes sense, right? Like so for someone like me who's introvert leftrain who can follow a structure and a system and just scale the [ __ ] out of it like it works. Someone who is creative like I don't know how as easily to do zero to one to come up with something. And I'm also being introvert don't connect and network and all of that like there's a reason I'm making these videos. Um so I don't have the back and forth of oh this is working now or oh this structure or system or this page flow. like all I find is what I find on the internet um what we run and what we learn while doing it and then what I buy and finding courses and masterminds and communities. So this is a lit I think this is only like a third of them but I found these all in like a courses folder I have and this is basically in order and I thought this is hilarious so I'm going to share this. So first course I ever bought was IG shoutout something. I couldn't even find it in here but once I saw these I was like oh I need to include this. I was 18 maybe, so like 10 years ago, maybe 19. And I had just had like an in real life business fail and was trying to do like private equity stuff and scale into all this whatever. And I literally got a ad or was like an organic, I believe, clicked into something, ended up going through a webinar funnel that I didn't even know was that at the time, bought for $4.97. And this was basically teaching how to do shoutouts to a lander that had an opt-in. And the opt-in then basically sent them to an email list. You were building an email list to monetize through affiliate traffic and the thank you page was literally just sending direct to a ClickBank affiliate link to essentially self-liquidate the cost of what you were paying for shoutouts back in the day on IG which was literally like the original version. So you'd pay a hundred bucks to get that. You'd send everyone there. You'd get however I don't even remember how many email leads and then they would send into this bucket. Then you'd email your list and you could expect a dollar per email on your list per month. And like failed miserably. like it worked and I got the there, but then I didn't want to email the list. I didn't want to pretend to be somebody I wasn't. It was just like this whole thing. But like that opened my brain into online marketing, digital marketing. So like yeah, I spent $500 and didn't make any because of me. That's the other thing is like people are like, "Oh, this didn't work for me." Or like, oh, like all of these have worked for someone and could work for you even if you use 1% of them or the entire framework or whatever. And to be like, oh, like I I didn't learn anything. It didn't work for me. It's like that's because of you, not because of that. even if it's again this much of it. So this then basically put me into like online marketing, learning ads, media marketing agency. I ran ads for people. I built random sales pages. I tried to learn, you know, pay-per-click and all this stuff. All of this could have been its own business and I could have been doing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month 10 years ago or eight year whatever this was eight years ago or something and I didn't, right? I just learn little snippets and like increase my skill level, but never fully deployed, never went solo, never like tried to do my own thing. Okay, Jeremy Haynes, this is so funny to me that I see this in here. So, like he had at the time I before I say anything, like literally love all his content, watch all his videos, has helped us a ton. Right now, our CMO is in talks to join in his mastermind. Like just how all this connects is what I'm getting at is like you can learn this much or just get connected or just meet somebody in the group and that can spiral into or scale more so into tens and hundreds of millions of dollars depending right so Jeremy I bought his like social media stuff was learning how to run ads I had his contract back in the day he had like megalodon or something and like just that alone was like oh this is a framework that people scale to a million dollars a month and that wasn't even his like coined phrase then but just hilarious that like I would of course I pay all these guys and pay for all of what they've learned to jump the line. Okay, Hack Reactor, then Lay Wagon. So, this is just kind of like a little funny offshoot. Then I was like, "Oh, I'm more technical than anything, less marketing, which is still true today, but I just harnessed it more into the marketing world." So, Lelay Wagon was an online um I'm sorry, an in-person coding boot camp, and they had them all over the world. And I was like, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm going to go into, you know, coding or uh investment banking or all like I was just where my interests were. I bought it. I learned a lot of the stuff. I did not implement in level of like oh let's scale like just lean full into this and that's on me for again not having a full-on e-commerce business or a full ad agency or anything not on the course but the things I learned and the little pieces I learned are then valuable today. Okay. So I ended up going to this it was in Bali. I lived there for like two or three months and lived in this place. And this is funny later because this is where I ended up meeting Luke and Nikki in person um who are the co-founders and creators of uh the company that we're running now that I'm now coowner of. Um, so it was down the street from where they ended up being when I met them in person for the first time. Just funny. So I did a whole boot uh coding boot camp, learned all that kind of stuff. This is the big one. Consulting.com. I bought Ovens's program. I if no one knows now, but he's the school.com. He like is the OG of the new age of online marketing um for coaches and consultants specific. People have their opinions. I don't care. Um, I bought his entry program, so like the accelerator, and then just bought the up level, which was at the time learning how to make a course, basically productize your service. So, his first offering was all about how to get clients consistently. The second offering was about how to uh productize a service. So, basically make group coaching, courses, all that kind of stuff. And then the third offering was how to like be the absolute master of your specific niche in business. And it was just a mastermind, right? I'm pretty sure those were three levels. So, I joined into this. And in that group, I like pretty instantly knew I didn't want to be the face of something and I didn't even have like the wherewithal and like in the brain to be like, "Oh, I could build this around someone else." And the co-founder of Warrior Babe, who I didn't even know at the time. So, he literally put a message in that group about something completely random. I was like, "Oh, I kind of recognize that name." Clicked through to his profile. He had just posted that he was looking to bring someone on to teach him marketing and sales and all this kind of stuff. I literally like applied or booked a call more so on this thing. talk to him and next thing you know uh I'm building random sales pages and just like learning technical stuff doing all the random things and making a thousand bucks every like six weeks and like fast forward to today and I'm now that was six years ago I think in a month. Yeah, six years ago in a month from when we had our like initial call and since then we've done 70 million in cash collected together. I've now become co-owner of the company. We're like you know thicker than thieves all the things because I met him in one of these courses. So like cool. I could have spent 500 grand on these and still had an insane ROI on courses overall, let alone this specific one that cost me like five grand, right? So it's just like that's the idea here is like this is the model we ran. Then once we did that, these are kind of in order but like close to Becker was selling this at the time. So he had like this YouTube and VSSL info product training that really was a Trojan horse for Hyros. But we joined in this. I took the VSSL framework that we used to do our first one to five million in cash collected, maybe even higher, and I took literally the VSSL template that was out of here, restructured it, built it, then uh the other co-founders wrote in basically like other pieces. I just built the entire framework out, went live with it, bought sales process.io, which is Nick Cosman, which is its own story, and he literally built and like showed entirely how to do the CRM for a callunnel. So we were on close.com and how to do the deal stages and like we had no idea. I had no idea. So we paid like six grand for this, five grand for this, six grand and like by the end of this this was our entire core business model that we then scaled to a million a month and three million a month and beyond was just from buying these and like combining them together. So if I say like bottleneck and interest mapping like we didn't know how to scale a VSSL funnel. We didn't know how to structure the tech behind a VSSL funnel. Like we just bought our way through it. Okay. Um, there's a bunch of these in here that are like just hilarious to me when I look back at because I'm like, "Oh, we use that." And I built a vegan blog for my mom and the thing scaled to whatever, four or five grand a month and she was just making four or five grand a month making vegan recipes and like through affiliate lab and just like where my interest lies. It like feeds the soul, right? You can get stuck in like monotonous day-to-day scaling the same thing, but like you're like, "Oh, cool. Like today I want to go and do, you know, a peak performance program or go into e-commerce or like learn about coding." And it's like do it. Who cares? Like there's a there's a fine line for sure between like distraction and interests and just like feeding into that. So don't let it just take over and don't stop what you're doing because it's hard and because it, you know, I don't know if it's going to work and like start a side business like that's different than what I'm saying here where it's interest, it's learning, it's growing, it's meeting people, it's doing all those things inside there. Netcommerce is a funny one. I bought uh Lucanet's course netscommerce because I was like all right, maybe I'll just do e-commerce. all these different waves and places in the in the company are like, "Oh, we're at this great point." One of the two really where it's like the side business stuff. It's like it's at such a great point that we work like, you know, way less hours a week. It's still like just printing cash. Maybe we should look at all these other fun things that are in interest as like a secondary business after this one. Um or it's, you know, things are all the way at freaking zero and it's like what are cash flow games and like I don't like that mentality. We've definitely had it and I've like corrected myself from having it. Um but yeah, that's an interesting piece. So, this next commerce thing, bought this course, learned about uh he basically just did a screen record about how he was doing insane numbers on e-commerce, uh like physical e-commerce. He then posts that he's looking for a WordPress developer for something. I'm not a WordPress developer. I swipe up on it. We go back and forth. He needs a site by end of next week. I do it that same night, cancel the date, or I'm actually on a date and then and just like cancel the evening part of the date and then go back, build this thing until 3 in the morning and deliver it the next day. that turns into me running Netscommerce, Nets trades back in the day, the tech stack behind it, the Discord, the connections with all this stuff and becoming friends with Luke Nets, just in that community, hearing before he even bought Pudgy Penguins. And then knowing, hey, scoop a couple of these, you know, those like as an example again of just like who you meet and just following interest of like, oh, I was interested in e-commerce. Oh, I'm interested. These people are cool. Oh, yeah. How can I provide value and work with them? Okay, I do. So then I hear about these things and like I'm an idiot and I could have been in that like I was in all these courses when people were doing 300 X's on meme coins. Didn't even like look at it. Didn't even know what that meant and I was running the actual tech and like the structure behind things. So it's just like it's funny but oops. Nothing held back. This is huge in copywriting and like offer design creation. I have a bunch of close people I've met in here. I paid for their program when it first dropped and just like the value in there is insane. And it also taught me that like I need to have people on the team who are like this, but like my brain doesn't fully work like this. I'm not great in copywriting, marketing, all that kind of things. Closers.io. This is we got to a point where we needed the sales team was getting out of hand and we were operating it, running it, onboarding them, managing it, doing all the things. So, this was an attempt at getting basically like an outsourced sales manager, which ended up not working. And one of the key things that they like said to us basically was like, you're at the size where you need like not an agency or somebody to do it. you need someone in-house which led us down the path of finding a sales manager. Crushed on that. Started to get into some of these pieces which is like you know interested in some of the PE stuff. I have friends that are in finance. I always think it's cool and like math and left brainy so I just lean into that. Um some more affiliate and lead genen stuff which led me into this. I end up going to some conference for affiliate marketing and lead genen. It's like a zero to 10k style or like zero to 100k is actually I think was their model. Um, I end up at that thing in San Diego, hang out with some guys in the lobby bar. Next thing you know, I'm at a club at somebody's table. Person whose table it is ends up selling a course later in life and I'm like connected with them. And then other people that, you know, not to be named, but like are crushing it in lead genen in in that space. I end up moving to Puerto Rico. I meet more people that are in lead genen affiliate space that are now some of my like closest friends. I run tech behind those still and have helped with those behind it. I've scaled offers that they already have going. Again, never done anything from scratch. No ego. Not saying I have, but like I have scaled their offers that exist or ran ran ads of their offers that exist and done tech behind it. So like I understand that space now because I've been in there ad outreach. We bought these guys, Alec, great dude. Um we've bought his stuff for organic and for paid on times on terms of YouTube and scaled up a big portion of things on YouTube at the time. It was a blocker. And like you'll see a ton of these things in here all the way down to AFL most recent one or not even most recent one which is funny but I just don't want to add the other one that we just bought. But uh AFL I just personally bought like followed Iman stuff since he had like I can't even I don't even know how little like 10 I don't even know sub 5K sub 10K like very small um like still operating and trying to scale up an agency small and follow his stuff forever. talks about personal brand. Big standout to me was, "Okay, cool. I have this whole like, you know, whatever level of skills times zero in visibility equals zero in, you know, results, zero in impact, whatever you want to call it." So, AFL was the kick in the ass for me to be like, "Okay, cool. Just start making YouTube videos every day." He teaches how to do this a much better way with better everything, uh, and structurally for the team and offer. And he's obviously like a smart dude. Um, but for me it just was like kick in the ass, be around other cool people in network um, that are all attempting to do the same thing, learn a bunch of stuff, and the real kick in the ass was like record some videos. Maybe they're not as polished and nice and whatever, and that's on purpose because I don't want that audience. That's not who I'm targeting. And yeah, so that and then yeah, I'm just going to go into this, but we just bought some other stuff that's like hilarious and interesting to me. But yesterday's stats, it did 620 in leads, 135 apps, 71 calls booked. We're scaling this down. If you have seen the videos on days prior, so we're scaling this down a bit to keep it tighter and be in the more purchase optimization pockets on Meta. We had five high ticket buyers, which is okay in the right direction, but like not good. Um, oops, I didn't update that. Low ticket buyers, 46. Cash collected was actually I didn't update this, my bad. was actually 53,599. That was from two days ago that I copied this over. Um, so yeah, so I do these videos every single day. I share these. I'm sure this is kind of exhaustive. It's just to show that like how you approach something and the reasoning behind it can be like just completely different, right? Like you can you don't have to listen to everyone who says, oh, like 99% of gurus are not legit. And I will agree with that. But the 1% that are, you can't let that distract you from the 1% of people who have extreme value, who have done it, who have the result. You're going to meet people in the group. There are people there, there's gurus that are not good that you're going to get in a group with somebody else who's trying to be like you and become close with and then scale something later. It's like you have to look at the pros in all these. Um, obviously weigh that in terms of ROI. It's like you want to try and pick the best ones where you're going to put in a,000 bucks and get out 10K directly and then you can make millions extra like, you know, indirectly. But yeah, that was just kind of the gist of today's video. So hopefully this was a bit valuable and offered a little bit of color to kind of the background. Um, any questions always Instagram is the best for communication. Comment below, share, do all the things to increase the YouTube algo so we can get this up to thousand couple thousand people that are in the high ticket info space, online scaling space as that is the goal. So talk soon.

# you’re split testing your call funnel wrong.. (watch this) | E27
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3p9Gtm6550

In today's video, I'm going to share how we lost millions of dollars split testing our CallFunnel the wrong way. We're going to go through an exact example and the data behind it on why this is so important specifically for CallFunnel owners. I'm going to go through the way that most people do it that is wrong. And I'm going to show you our setup that is accurately tracking and working today. If you stick around to the end, I'm going to go through yesterday's stats. I make these videos every single day. So, I share real time what we are doing and where our numbers are at. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected. I make everything on this channel to show what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing to scale to 100 million a year, all with the goal of finding top talent, opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, this is like a real life example of one we're actively running right now. And the red here is what we're split testing, and the green are the goals. Okay? So, this is uh an example of a VSSL split test. So, people opt in and they automatically go 50/50 to lead one VSSL and lead two VSSL. All right? So, pretty simple standard test. Now green is the goals that are on page. So someone landing on the application, completing the application, landing on a booking, completing the booking, landing on the booking success page, and then terms over here is for purchasing. So this is why it's so important is because a lot of the time in call funnels, you're doing this offline conversion. It's over the phone, it's on a Zoom, and how are you tracking it back to that split? Okay, so here are just some crazy numbers that I ran this morning for this. So I took all the data of our 2024 purchases and how many of them and the time between when somebody opted in and when they actually completed purchase on average was 25.5 days and this is out of only the data of purchasers. Okay. How many between the time between application and purchase was 6 days and from the date that they actually booked the call not when they had the sales call and we have a 48 hour booking window. So from the date that they booked the call to the day they purchased on average was 3.6 days. So any of these tools you're using need to need to encapsulate and capture all the data from where they were this entire part of the funnel because 25 days later they're purchasing and you're trying to figure out when they landed on this page and which one they landed on. This is like so so critical because on page but not really. What I mean by that is yes it's tracking the user on page but you need to be able to store this server side and keep the data to know way way way way more accurately. So when someone lands on an app page in a lot of these split testing tools, it needs to be able to identify that person and know that what page they're on here to market as okay, they hit this goal, they hit this goal, they hit this goal, right? The terms and making it all the way to the end of the purchase is just like massive because they won't do anything on page. So how does it know and connect back? So V1 of this for us was Hyros. So we set up page rules in here. So basically when they landed on training-vsl1 we made a page rule that uh would basically tag them with this when they hit this URL and then anywhere else down the funnel because hyros is tracking when they do these other steps down here then we could track it back. I don't have a simple answer for you on why this did not work but this is the way we ran it for like years and every time something would happen. We ran one for like 6 months and we came uh probably longer than that and we came back and had training VSSL1 and training VSSL 2 ran them over a six-month period and they were literally down to like $1,000 difference in cash collected, right? Because the big thing here and like my business partner leans really heavy into this and I push back but like I'm on the bandwagon now. But in this VSSL, if you said, "Oh, like this one gets a 50% higher application rate than this one." You'd be like, "Oh, just mark it." because that's really easy to track. Really, really easy to track that this one got this all the way back to purchase. Little harder to track. Way longer time period. But what I'm trying to get at is if in VSSL lead one you put and the program's $1,000 and I'm going to give you a Lamborghini and this and this. And then on this one you said, "Oh, it's going to be $50,000 and it's going to be the hardest thing of your life." But the offer is the same that's pitched on the back. you are going to have more applications, more throughput of this one, but when it goes to backing out, you're going to have a lower closing percentage than somebody who has a more accurate like uh consistency throughout the funnel, right? So, it is so important that you track on opt-ins, for example, getting a 25% opt-in rate and a 20% opt-in rate that might back out into actual purchases like night and day 50% difference depending on the messaging. So, it's important that you know all of the numbers. You can make decisions based on the applications or how many bookings you get, but what you really really want to do in our opinion is that you want to make them based on what actually backs into dollars. So knowing that this one has a 30% lift in cash actually collected, not just more apps and bookings, right? And there's a time and place for all this, but this is why this is important. So we tried to do this with Hyros. It did not work. Okay. So now I'm going to show you the setup that we have that actually does work right now. VWO and HubSpot. So this is marrying those two things together to where you have the onpage data tracking. There are stats within VWO, but is mirroring the data with HubSpot and storing it in your main CRM. And you can use whatever CRM, I'm pretty sure, like they're in their integrations. So, all you're going to do in this example is you're going to set up, and I blacked all this out for sections that were like just unique and like customer information and stuff. So, the different variations in this example, you're going to drop in your main control. So, in our example, VSSL1. Then, you're going to drop in the split and you're just going to launch as a 50/50 URL split test. Okay. Now, goals inside platform, all you're going to do is track page visits on URL contains. And this is very similar to like how all the other tools work. And it just basically says when they land on this page, it's going to tag them. It's going to show that it landed on this, this, and this. You're going to have a 30% here, 10% here, 2% here, whatever. Okay. Now, what that's going to allow you to see is the different goals and their completion rates. And you're going to go here, and you can see scheduled success. And this is a real live example. I mean, today's April 8th, so I I pulled this this morning. Um, but this would show that all the way back down to the scheduled success VSSL 2 so far. So, VSSL 2, oops, all the way back to the scheduled success page has a 5.24% conversion rate, which is 10% higher than the control. Okay, all this is pretty normal in split testing. So, nothing like groundbreaking here. But for us, where it really changed is when we did the direct integration with HubSpot. And this may be like common practice for a lot of people. All I'm saying is we lost literally millions of dollars doing this the wrong way. Um then once you integrate with HubSpot Direct, it's going to push in as custom data. And I had to black some of these out. And like so right here, it's going to show you the customer name and profile when the action was completed, meaning when they hit the split test, the URL they were on that it fired, their country, region, all the stuff. And then this is the important part. So it's going to track back to the contact level the campaign they were in inside VWO the experience ID. So basically you have a campaign that has experiences inside of it and the experiences have different variations. Okay. So now what you can do is then say in charts my beautiful terribly ugly chart um there's somebody who could do this a lot better but it just gets me the data and that's what I need. You can see how many people hit the split test. So in this example, how many people landed on the VSSL? How many people then completed the application as a form submission? How many then booked a call? And then how many closed one? So I could pull these up and I I don't have this data directly, but um I could pull this up and show you the two examples of lead one versus lead two when we ran this. And these are like so so similar, right? You just saw the example of how similar these lines are. So it backs out to very very similar here. I mean, it's going to be the same here because it's how many land on it. here is going to be how many apps they got. So, this was a slight variation where two actually had I'm sorry, the control actually had more call scheduled control actually had more, but backing out the lead two had like 20% higher purchases. So, just crazy to see that like it has more calls, more apps, same amount of attempts, and has more users that backed out, right? So, just shows you how integral this is. So, you can do this at every single layer of the funnel. Um, you can do this all the way up to I gota zoom out for you. Whoops. Um, you can do this on the opt-ins. You can do this on VSSLs. You can do this on apps, booking page. Like we have one that was going for a while that was the booking page copy. So, one that was like a preframe that was way more aggressive that was like literally don't book a call unless you're serious. And then we had one that had no text on it and obviously one gets a higher completion rate than the other, but which one backs out more? In the end, one landed that had like a middlegrade copy, got more qualified people and didn't like added resistance but not too much to still get the completion. So, that was a big key for us. I hope this was helpful. Um, there's exact setups and tech and all that. I just can't share the back end of that because I will just show too much customer information and URLs and things. Um, but it's very simple setup. I'm super pissed that it took me so long to do this and get this set up in a correct way. Um, we did try it with Hyros. don't have an exact reason on why this didn't work because you'd think it would if there was a tag that fired for that exact uh person because it has all their fingerprints. It has all the stuff that they've done throughout over time. So just being able to look and say who has training VSSL tag one across this range and what it really came down to was that whole like across ranges. So if you're doing it across this range, there's cash that's collected that's like at a later date. There's cash that or like leads that haven't been realized. Like it's really weird like how they do the attribution of the timing. Um, we went crazy custom with this and got this built because we thought it was a URL tagging issue. So, we did an on page firing custom events and like everything all the way down to just like not working in the end and this was like nine clicks. Um, another quick little thing on this uh super technical or not super but very technical is we have we customized the script on this because essentially you need the VWO script to load the page and choose what split test so which VSSL they're going to go to. Then you need the HubSpot like script to run so it can identify what the person's information is and basically have that to match with the customer profile. And then you need the VWO thing to like fully load to send that information. Right? So VWO to do the transfer or to pick the split. Then you need the HubSpot uh to load to get the like HubSpot UTK and tracking and then you need to push that over through V back to VWO. So then it can push all of that together over to HubSpot to match because it's super important like in this column that I don't have here that it's showing the profiles because if it's not connecting to a profile, there's no data being stored. Like it's it's logging into here, but it's not showing or connecting to an actual profile. So it's not going to be helpful for you to see which person did what. Um I don't know if I shared this ever, but I have a sticky note on here that's like every one is someone and I always look at that, which is like all these are one specific person, and I have to like remind myself that sometimes. Um but you have to look at it in that way to understand sometimes on these splits like at volume it's just numbers. Um but like each individual one when you're doing these splits and the data behind it is all the way back to one person. So blah blah blah but yesterday's stats let's get into it. 632 leads 200 apps 85 calls booked not on day seven high ticket buyers. So, I don't know if you watched yesterday's, but uh not we have been in a not good position where we've been closing like one or two or three a day, which is like terrible for us. So, seven is a getting closer and back on track, but still not necessarily where we want to be. 32 32 low to get buyers. We decided to chop down some of the spend on that to get it back to kind of like just a baseline amount until we know that the numbers back out. Our target for this is anywhere from 3.5 to 4% ascension rate. But when you're ramping so many new low tickets, it is or so many new uh purchasers. We don't know the timeline uh of what it's going to take to cash close. So like I said on this, we don't have Whoops. We don't have these stats in like a clean way where we know how long it takes them to go from low ticket purchase to uh setter call or closer call to purchase uh of the backend program. We don't have that yet. So, I'm just waiting to track on that. But yesterday, 32 of those and then 51k in cash collected versus the day before. I'm showing exact streamshots cuz I don't care. And you can look at yesterday's and I had this one on here yesterday. So, yeah, that's what I got. So, Instagram for communication. Comment below, feed the algo, share it. I don't know what to do, but I make these videos every day. Let me know what you want more videos on. Tuxen.

# fully automated $5m in sales commissions. here's how. | E26
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKvPzLOYoq4

In today's video, I'm going to share tactically how we automate our sales rep commissions. This has saved us hundreds of thousands of dollars in terms of admin work, cash collection, payout correction, all of the things. I'm going to show you how to set up automated tables as you scale so that each sales rep will have their dedicated amounts of sales, rev, refunds, net rev, all the things that go into commissions. How you can then beautify and gify simple data like this. We're going to go through the overall thinking and process, which is really the most important part for you depending on your tech stack. I'm going to share the exact zaps that we use and how they fuel into these. And then if you stick around to the end, I make these videos every single day and I'm going to share yesterday's stats um all the way down to the stripe. All right, last year we did 30 million cash collected. I make all the videos on this channel to share what did work, what did not work as you'll see uh act and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent, top opportunities and building a network of people who are doing the same. All right, so automating sales rep commissions. I have an o like an OG video on the on the channel that's like four years ago on how we did this. But really what this is is this is like a simple Google sheet version. I put all this together for this and blacked out any like customer info or sales rep info or anything like that. So what you can by the end of this is have your bookings, your sales, so you can get your sales per booking. You can get all this stuff all into one thing. The big thing here is data. Okay. So being able to collect how much revenue was collected from the initial charge and future payment plans if that's how you choose to pay sales reps. We do not anymore. I can go to that later. Refunds and the clawback because you should not be paying commissions on refunds, right? It needs to be the net revenue number and then commissions based on that. Okay. So here's an example of what a viewer looks like for us right now. So this is just to gamify it a little, but essentially you're going to have your sales rep ID, their name across, and then you can have their month-to- date sales for booking, their show rates. All this is just viewing the data. Okay, so like Google has theirs, this is a looker studio. So your looker of viewer, all you're doing is looking or viewing the data that exists. Okay, so the key thing we're going to set up is how to get data into somewhere that it can be viewed. But then you can have your point systems, your bases, your overall team stuff, your bonus thresholds to when they hit these other things and gify it. But yeah, so simply put, this is the flow. Okay, you're going to have an order form or multiple that is going to be for a sales rep. Okay, so in this, we'll use our exact example. On an order form, you're going to have multiple payment or multiple products or payment types. Okay, you're going to have your paid in full. You're going to have your payment plans, you're going to have all that stuff. Now, the key here is on your order form, you either need to be able to identify who the sales rep was with a field. So sales rep ID is the best. You don't want to use name. You could use email. It's a little bit more unique, but like you have to start thinking a little bit more data focused. And in data, everything has a unique identifier. So a sales rep ID or whatever that is. Okay? So for us, that's what we use. Now the other option is to have multiple order forms, which is the flow I'm going to show you is actually how we are still set up. So each sales rep will have their own order form. And what that allows is instead of it having to have the form inside the form to do it, like let's say you sent it to sales uh to customers, you will have the actual sales ID is going to be the order form, right? So that's how you're going to be able to identify which sales rep did which by order form. Okay? It's going to pass through the processor and the processor is actually what's going to run the in meaning the charges that come in as well as out. So the refunds that come out and then you're going to put them in a viewer. Very simply put. Okay. So in this example, you have two sales reps. They both have their own order form. They run the payments. It lands in the processor and it goes into this logger, which can be a Google sheet. It can be an air table. It could be anywhere you store data. And it is going to show the date of the transaction. It's going to show what the transaction type was. It's going to you're going to put everything. It's going to show the uh amount. And then one of those columns is going to be the sales rep ID or in some way, shape, or form identify the sales rep. Okay? their name, their email, their ID. ID again is the best. Now, the beauty of that is once it's stored in this processor at the customer level, which I'll get into, it'll come in for all in and all out. Then all you need is a viewer that can look across that and say, "Okay, where sales rep ID across this range was there? There was one refund and for how many dollars?" Across this range on the in, you have two different things. You have an in tracker and an out tracker. Okay. How many came in? How many came out? What's the net amount? pay commissions on that is like the very simple way to look at this. Okay. Now, inside a processor or a CRM or where anything you're gonna have a customer, okay, this kind of like 1.0 data or 101. So, you're going to have a customer. Inside that customer, it can have the customer will have charges. They'll have refunds. They will have payment plans or like uh schedules inside them. And what they can also have is a sales rep, okay, as a custom field. uh some softwares already have them. Our example is Stripe, and I'm about to show you our whole flow here, but there's like 19 other things that can be in this, but this is the very simple way to look at it. So then everything that happens to a customer once a sales rep is assigned will be attributed to the sales rep. Okay? So every future payment that comes out, a refund that comes out into the future, anything that happens after that fact of the sales rep being added to the customer is very simply attributed back to the sales rep. Okay? And you can do this in like all the ways. So like once you do coaching and you have coaches into the future, how much cash collected do they have under a coach like you can do all of that once you have your data set set up correctly. Okay. So master's app that we have here is basically a new charge is going to come in in Stripe. Okay, that's the first thing that happens. That is like the trigger for all this because we want it on real cash. Now the other thing on here and what we're actually actively moving over to is where is your data source? What is your like core piece? And this what I'm I'm about to show you has three data sources, which is like not ideal. And we already said we're going to wait until we're back at like three million and some change to move over to a a centralized data source. So like a a source of truth is what they call it. So we're going to move everything of ours into HubSpot. Right now it's a Google sheet, two Google Sheets and Stripe, right? All have different technically kind of pieces. Stripe kind of, but like really it's two different Google Sheets. So, what we're going to do is we are going to have a new charge trigger this and it's going to delay. And it's technically delaying. And this is not the perfect way to set this up. I set these up way back when and like Band-Aid solution just to solve for this. And we've since updated and updated and like all this is going to get an overhaul, but like this works and has worked for up to like four million a month like it doesn't break. So, or 3.8 million or I believe was the number. I'm not going to say we did four million because we didn't. new charge comes in delayed and then these are happening in the background. Okay, so we are so old school. We are still using Clickfunnels for our order forms. So for us, we're using like I said before multiple order forms. So each sales rep has their own dedicated order form. All right. So what's going to happen on here is a new purchase is going to come in. Okay. When it comes in, it is going to do a lookup inside that in logger. It's then going to find that customer based on the purchase and it's going to update the customer. The updating the customer is adding in this custo sales rep ID into the stripe customer. Right? So what that allows us to do is then when it pushes into the in logger, you're going to have the date of the transaction, the amount, the everything, but it's also going to have the sales rep ID inside there. Okay? So we are assigning the sales rep ID to the customer so that that payment and then all future payments, refunds, anything can get pushed into that sheet. Okay, now that's what's going to happen here and some other stuff. I'm not going to go into the other pieces, but like we push everything into HubSpot. This is where we tag things. This is where we say this is a new purchase on this date came from the sales rep. Like so you can store this information either in HubSpot or in Stripe or both. Like we have it in both. Not ideal because you want one source of truth and with with us it's going to be HubSpot. But for how we're collecting payments right now, we do it inside Stripe so that all of this automation piece is in. Okay. Now, this one other piece that's going to happen is we're also then going to look up that transaction uh or that row in that sheet and we are going to tag that first purchase that came from the order form as new. So, we have another column in there that basically like I said like the type of the transaction is going to come in in this in logger and it's going to show the date, the charge, the amount, the sales rep ID, and then if it came from an order form, we know it's a brand new transaction. We're going to tag it as new. Why that's important is because for us, we only pay sales reps on the first 30-day cash collection. Okay? So, if someone does a PIF 7200 or whatever, we pay them right then and they're in that in that pay period. Now, if someone signs up for a payment plan for like 2K a month, the sales rep is only paid on the first amount during that month. So, just that 2K, right? So, we incentivize for PIFFs and then also just on cash collection over time, it's on it. It falls into the coaching bucket. Okay? So, that was a big shift we made. And this entire thing was actually built off the idea of how do we pay coaches forever on payment plans? But for us, it just wasn't incentivizing the right behavior. It was making it so they were getting paid out like these amounts over months and then they didn't have to work as hard to get new cash. and it was like not ideal, right? They had like renewal income that was coming in, which give and take, like I I I saw the pros and cons of both models, but this just like how we do it. Um, and what this also incentivizes, which is huge for us that I could do a whole another video on, but is the sales rep reaches out within the first 30 days to like see how they like it and do whatever. And we'll then push them to PIFF within that first 30 days, which they do get commission on. And that happens like all the time, like all the time. So, we'll have like a payment plan where someone got 3,600 or 3,100 or whatever. They'll talk to them 20 30 days in and be like, "Hey, do you love this?" Instead of making these extra whatever 1 or 2k in payments over the year, do you just want to pay for the whole thing up front, like the spread? And they'll be like, "Yeah, you know what? Sure." And then they'll just do a 5k payment. We process it with billing. They paid the 7,200, not on the first call date, they paid 2,200, then they paid another 5gs within that first 30 days, and we honor the PIFF pricing for 30 days. Okay? So little random golden nugget. But so that new purchase comes in comes into here looks up and goes new. Okay. So we know inside of our looker inside of our stuff if it says this transaction has a sales rep ID and says new it's a new transaction. Okay. Now delays come through find that customer again look it up. We also find the uh this is the tool that we use for um the fulfillment. So, we're also looking this up because if new transactions come in or a transaction comes in, the back-end stuff is all we do like commissions for sale uh for coaches. So, on the fulfillment side, because a sales rep gets them in, gets commissions. Once that someone stays, we have that staying commission is through the coach. Okay? So, we look up the coach, we find the client, we look up the coach ID, we log the coach ID. Now, all that then does is pop into here and uh put it in this uh basically it's like looking if they've already done it before and it'll combine transactions. This one's a little bit more advanced. Same with this one. This as simple as it creates that row. Very simple. And this is all you need. You need like four of these steps, two of these steps, three of these steps. Okay. So, where am I? Back to this. All you need to do this is either dedicated order forms or an order form that identifies which sales rep it was inside the order form. Okay, it's going to pass in. When it's passed in, it stores that in that customer level. This is a recap here. Customer level has a sales rep attached to it. Now, anything that happens into the future for that customer is tagged to that sales rep. Very simple. Okay. And then this is how I have other videos talking about the uh marketing tracker like 1.0 or 101 version. All you need is two tabs in a Google sheet for the for the basic version of this that'll literally log the date, the time, I'm sorry, the date, like the email, everything you can about the transaction. So date that came in, what type it was, the amount, the fees, uh what the source was for Stripe or deposit or whatever, all the way down. and then a sales rep ID column, a new if you want to track what's new or not. You can also get that from type depending on what you use. All in an in tracker. Now, every time a Stripe thing comes in, floods through that, pushes into that sheet, pushes into that sheet. You can push this into a sheet, air table, HubSpot, wherever. Same thing with uh out every time a refund is triggered inside Stripe, push into a sheet. Same exact thing, date, amount, fees, source, email, everything you can into there. And then all you need is one central literally you can go on Upwork and in like for like $150 you can have someone make this because they can see two very clean data sheets and be like okay what do you want now? Okay, you want it across ranges. How many uh new units happen for this and this? Okay, oh you want to know the sales reps across here. They have a sales rep ID table that has the sales rep ID and name and they go okay there was 17 transactions for this sales rep ID and it logs across here with how many sales they had, how many rep, how much rev, how all that like all that matters is that you get the data in one place. How you view it then after is like the easiest thing possible. Okay, now that's basically what I got for this. I don't want to go too crazy in depth because I'm just like yapping in circles about this, but like it's so it's so simple once you understand that all it is is the data portion and then how you view it in the division and across this and ranges is is the easy part, I guess, right? I guess they're both easy parts, but that's that. Uh ask any questions you have. I have like three different people that were asking me this about like the thinking behind it or like not as much detail in terms of like the technical, but yeah. So, yesterday's stats, terrible day on the streets. 682 leads, 365 apps, 108 calls with only two buyers. This is like again, I don't know if if you guys have seen other videos on this about me talking like this on this should be 10 plus like 10 plus units over a 10% sales per booking. So, something is like fundamentally broken uh in terms of marketing, sales, the the tie between them two. So, we're like actively working on this as you can imagine. I'm making these videos at like 6:00 in the morning um so that I can then actually work all day. But um low ticket buyers 49. Uh we're scaling this up still, but 30K in total cash collection. I'm just going to start dropping a Stripe screenshot on these is literally yesterday's Stripe, but 30K yesterday, which is so bad. So bad. Um this needs to be like at minimum like 75 G's just to like feel okay and like pay bills. So we're in it right in the trenches. Uh you know, it's important to who you listen to. So, this is where we're at and take that into account when listening to me. Yes, we scaled up and yes, we did those bigger numbers, but like right now we're back in the trenches trying to figure it out and rebuild things. So, talk soon everyone. Instagram for uh communication, comments, shares, feed the algo so I can get these out. Talk soon.

# our funnel booked 119,473 calls... (full breakdown) | E25
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdSyAb9ujIo

In today's video, we're going to do a full breakdown on our funnel that has generated 119,473 calls. We're going to go through some quick data on how many leads and applications were generated to get those calls and then those calls turning into mid-t buyers, high ticket buyers, and the total cash collected. Then I'm going to do a full deep dive on every single step of the funnel, show you the pages, the automations, everything. And then if you stick around till the end, I'm going to go through yesterday's stats because I make these videos every single day. All right. Now, last year we did 30 million in cash collected and I make everything on this channel just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. So, let's get into it. So, first things first, leads inside of HubSpot. We have 1.15 as of this morning. Today's April 6, 2025 of those. Then 300Kish turned into applications, which is about 16 questions. I'll show you the whole thing below. 120,000 booked calls which turned into 12,000 midt buyers and I'm calling midt uh an old info product we used to sell that was anywhere from $500 to $1,500 high ticket buyers 9,000 which is for us right now a 7k annual ticket and total cash collected is 70,737,000 as of this morning all right now let's get into the funnel so this entire thing is a VSSL call funnel right so first things first is they are going to opt in so this page we're going to send them and there's variations of all of these like split tests and stuff like that. But this is the current control. So these page is where they're going to go to give us a name and email. All right. So first things first, all meta and Google traffic is going to go to an opt-in page and then from that opt-in page go to a VSSL page. This is our current VSSL page. We have this two or three-way split. And the big thing here is a majority of this is on mobile. So that apply now is showing right now, but it would not show when someone first pops on here. So we have mobile and desktop VSSLs. About 90% of the traffic is mobile. It's actually funny. We have a pretty high amount of tablet, too, just because of who our demo is. So this is the VSSL page. Now through here and here, we've collected their name and email, but we don't have their phone number. We don't have any of that. Okay. Next is going to push them to that application page. So if they stick around, different VSSLs are different lengths, anywhere from 22 minutes to 26 minutesish. Um, and towards the end of the video, the call to action, they get pushed to the apply page. So, here they're going to land on the application. This is about 16 questions that goes through where we collect a bunch of information on where they're currently at um, and where they're trying to go. And you can go through this kind of on your own time. Um, try and keep this short, but if you go through here, in here, it will get their phone number and a financial qualifier. So, this is new to us. Um, so we've never had this in here uh up until about 3 months ago. And I'll share that in the funnel um in the funnel map. So that's what I mean by router. So when someone answers this and says less than 1K, that's a big indicator for us because it has about half the uh quality score. So half the closing score as these other answers. So call it 5% on these and then the rest are 10 11 12% depending on these buckets. Okay. So there's going to be a router that happens. I'm going to go through the top main core part of the funnel and then go into all the breakdowns and show you. So, blue is essentially all of the sales, all the pages on site. Yellow is all the communication that happens via email. Red is going to be SMS and green is going to be a human. Okay. So, the router will then happen and anyone who is above 1K is going to get sent to a booking widget. So, they're going to get sent to this page right here where we do qualifying copy that basically like tells them not to book if they're not serious. And this is just a goal to make sure that we have as much quality as possible on the closer calendar. They can book 48 hours in advance. Um, so today plus, so like right now it's 6:00 in the morning, so they can't even book into this day because it starts at 8 a.m. on the calendars. Um, and then some cool custom U pieces that are if they can't find a time on here, they submit a request that goes to closers, setters, that whole jam. All right, so that's a booking page. Once they are successfully booked, they're going to land on a booking success page, which looks like this. basically tells them what to expect before the call. I'll go into some of the automations and why this part works, but watch a video that's a pre-framing video, look at some testimonials, and then watch a bunch of reviews. All right. Now, once they land on there, they are called they land on a closer calendar. All right. So, human and then land into a routing cycle where it's basically or not a routing cycle as much as a stage cycle. So, everyone is auto set as call scheduled. When the call is generated, they are 30 minute Zoom calls. And then from there, the calls then change to go to either a no-show, cancel. For us right now, uh we're getting like 50% show rates, which historically we've gotten closer to 60 plus. Um so that's something we're currently working on, but no shows and cancel. Hot listing is basically meaning that they are husband objection, financial objection, but they are qualified, right? So this just means like a follow-up like but short term. Uh long-term follow-up is somebody who's, you know, come back to me in three months or six months, but they're interested and they are qualified or they could be. DQ is just there's no way, disability, welfare, stuff like that. Close lost means they had the opportunity to do it. They were somebody who was qualified and could have, but the sales rep closed uh did not win the deal. And then closed one means they purchased, they're in the program, and then they go over to our terms page, which I have other videos on the channel why this is important, because this fires all kind of stuff for Facebook. All right. So that is the core top half of the funnel. Now anybody can do that. Anyone has that. Now the other pieces that occur are important extremely. So here all of the emails that are going to come from here from opt to app. Okay. So the first bucket of people we have are people who apply or uh opted in but did not apply. Now we only have their name and email. Okay. So they exist in HubSpot but what can we send them? So, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to send them back to a VSSL replay page. And this is going to be a struggle of me trying to find these. Um, this So, we'll send them to a VSSL replay page. It's basically just says, "Hey, watch the VSSL again. Uh, you know, confirmed." And then it is going to always have an application that it's going to push them to. So, this is one of the automations. So, for the push to apply. So, we're basically just sending email after email every single day that is pushing them back to pages like this or very similar that is getting them to re-watch the VSSL, consume more content, and then go down to apply. Okay, so that's what all of these push to apply emails are. Now, again, we can't SMS, we can't outbound, we can't anything except via email because we only have their email. We've ran tests in the past and for us at the time uh it did not back out for us to get the 20 30% drop in opt-in rate with adding a phone number because we weren't making more per person uh per lead. So like revenue per lead was not the same or was not high enough to justify the decrease. Okay. So we're going to send them to here and then this is like a big core page. We're going to send them to a VSSL bonus page. So in this VSSL it says, "Hey, if you stay until the end, I'm going to give you XYZ, right?" Um, so it's going to say you can get all these free bonuses which are XYZ guide or this or this or this if you stay till the end. So we send them to I believe where did I have it? This one. So we send them to this page and this is frame. This is a Becker thing that we learned like a long time ago. I don't know if this is still relevant but we still run it. Um, so it's basically your free bonuses are at the bottom. All this is mobile by the way. Everyone is going to go on mobile. Okay. So your free bonuses are on the bottom. has them here and it's just filled with apply now CTAs but it pushes consumption to them to watch the VSSL and then has asks them to apply goes down here and then claim your fee bonuses. So we have these four bonuses that if you stay to the end and these are like our biggest buyer pockets. So for us in this women's fitness niche uh menopause busy mom guide stopover training and ultimate guide to macronutrients are like our four main buckets of things. Um, so like menopause, mindset, muscles, macros, and uh these get claimed like crazy. So this will be the second email in this push to apply sequence. So it's basically like, hey, here's your first one. And the second one is here's your bonus access. And it's sent like within 20 minutes of after uh watching the VSSL. So everybody gets it even if they don't watch the whole VSSL. But the idea being someone stays to the end of the VSSL, you get it, right? So this page is huge. Um, this page is huge. And both of these generate a ton of traffic uh for us in application volume. So now someone's going to land on this application and like I said, if they answer above any of these, it is going to route them to this main booking widget. If it does not, they're going to land on a DQ booking page. Okay, the DQ booking page is identical, but it has no Facebook tracking. Okay, so I have other videos on this on how we train the pixel, but essentially this page just doesn't fire anything back to uh Facebook. This one does with the goal of having our schedule event that is firing only quality, only people who are the highest likelihood that they are going to convert. So those above than 1k people, right? They're also going to land on a scheduled success DQ page. Same thing doesn't fire the pixel, but it's an exact dupe. All right, now last piece on here. This was not been running up until like a month ago, so it's not really reflected in these numbers, but I'm just going to share. During the day, if we have not enough bookings coming into the next day, we'll let people book in as DQ. Okay, so the difference here on the widgets too on who they can book with on this portion is two different booking widgets dependent on the page. And these are going to be lower quality or reps who are, you know, not as high converting or new ramping reps. This is going to be that top quality uh reps. You have all the guys, sales trainers, hormone, whoever in the world that says match your top leads with your top closers. They cannot be compared direct in percentage of close, but there is a baseline of what we know because we do know the funnel quality traffic. And even if they're DQed, they might not be this level caliber, but they still do close. We still have whatever 5 to 7% of total of these that will close. So, it works. Okay. Now, we will send them to a low ticket if the calendars are full. So, we try and push as much quality as possible. overflow into D uh DQ just to make sure that the calendars have as much uh volume as possible and they have in their day. And then DQ is if the calendars are booked, we're just going to DQ them straight. And this DQ page looks like this. So we'll say, "Hey, your application was not uh immediately approved. Mandy from our coaching team or from our team, which is an AI bot, so like an SMS AI bot is going to reach out with a couple more questions, but join this ultimate guide." This ultimate guide is then a low ticket that we are actively running and building out. This is the old version, but it's currently in a VSSL split, so ugly as can be, but converts. Okay, so this is a piece that I'm not going to go into fully in this video, but we're fully running low ticket. I have other videos on the channel. Um, yesterday we did 60 units of this low ticket um both through this and also direct traffic. Okay, now going to the automations. So like I said, yellow is going to be email, red is going to be um SMS, and green is going to be human. So yellow, first thing you have is push to book email. So push to book exactly the same as what you'd look like as for push to apply. So you're going to have everybody who has applied but not booked, right? So these are like high intent people. They just spent 16 17 questions, so however many minutes that is, 7 to 11 minutes depending um filling out the application but then just didn't book. Did they not find a time they like? Did they not uh know it was a call? Did they not whatever. So we send them a full push to book sequence and we send it to them 3 minutes after. if they applied but didn't book. Should only take up to 3 minutes to find the spot you want and book in. And then uh every day we send them an email all contextual pushing them back to book. Now, important thing we just learned on this is I actually have a dupe of this out that Oops, SMS was supposed to be there. Um, but I pushed a book out that is uh AI based that is for SMS and then these are both routed depending on if they answered less than 1K and if they answered above that they will go to the dedicated pages so that you keep the pixel clean. Okay, so big key there to where the DQ ones only can book through the DQ widget instead of just sending them all back to the main booking page and then pixeling everybody with not quality traffic. All right. Push to book DQ is what I was going to there. And this is what I meant to do. Oops. Knew I messed something up for you guys. All right. Now, the last piece on here is push to book setters. So, we have a channel that is completely dedicated. And I can't show Slack because it has too much like customer personal information in it, but push to book setters. This is newer to us in the last like month. So, again, non-reflective of these numbers, but the push to book for setters is the same thing. So they basically get everybody who applied but did not book, they'd land in a Slack channel rated with uh like bells. So it'll be no but none for the less than 1K, one for the 1 to five, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 plus. And they're and they're just bells on them so you know which ones to prioritize. And this is huge for us. So like right now I have all these trackers open on other screens but so for us our setters right now on those that bucket of leads is converting at 60% show rate and 12% live call rate which is great right so that is both a marrying and this is like them ramping okay and that's directly out of that bucket almost exclusively okay now went through all these pages went through the DQ success through here now what happens when somebody books a call right all right next piece is going to the the pre-all emails or like call confirmation emails. These I have another entire video on this. Uh our show rates are not the best. None of this is meant to say this is exactly the way to do this or the the triedand-true like perfect way. Um we're constantly testing things, figuring it out. So for our pre-all setup, we have a call that come or an email that's going to come from the sales rep immediately. Um we have this which is huge. As soon as someone books, lands in a Slack channel and we have a 20our a day, 7-day a week triage team that calls them. If they don't answer, calls them again, leaves a voicemail, and texts them. Okay? And the entire thing is like, you need to confirm your call. Just making sure that you know it's a Zoom call. Just making sure that you know that it's uh central time zone. Is that all good? Cool. All right. Boom. Go into HubSpot, check off that they're confirmed. If they do not confirm, they sit in this unconfirmed bucket. Stats around this for us. The ones that confirm have a 40% higher close rate blended, right? Crazy. and show rate is 20% higher. So on average we'll get 70% of the ones that confirm actually show and then of the others it's you know 40 or something like that. So it's like 30ish% depending and then it blends out to our 50ish number. Right now pre-all emails that's going to be from the sales rep. Then pre-all SMS is going to send 30 minutes after that from that's AI infused from a sales rep that's going to say hey uh I saw your application. AI is going to look at the application, feed in some thing, and say, "I see that you're 35 and looking for this, this, and this. Uh, here's a site, a page from our site that I think is going to be valuable for you to watch. Did you get the link?" And it's going to ask them that, start up a conversation. And that entire thing is dynamic AI, but sent through the sales rep. All right, we have the Calendarly ones, the automated, we have a couple emails that exist throughout that, but those are the core ones that actually like get the response rates, but then increase the show rates. And again, none of this say this tried and true in the way to do it. This is how we do it right now. Not the only way to do it. So, land on a sales call with a closer, go through these stages. I kind of went into these, but these all have their own automations that live within them. So, when someone no-show cancels, it feeds back into a bucket that then the setters are going to hit. The hot listing ones feed a follow-up pipeline. The long-term follow-up feed a longer term follow-up pipeline. DQ fully out, close loss. There's like a winback style sequence. Um, and then yeah, all that is stored in there. So, tried to go through that as quick as I could. Um, and now let's get into yesterday's stats. So, yesterday we did 725 leads. We did 301 applications, 81 calls. So, this is crazy for us. I have other videos talking about this, but like we are not in a good position right now. I'm glad I'm making these videos cuz like we're in a good position going into the future, but like day on day cash is like not good just because we have all these marketing things we're changing and then also ramping new sales reps doing them at the same time. Not ideal. Um, so 300 apps and 81 calls. So, what that means on a marketing standpoint, because this number is usually way higher for that many apps, but that just means that everyone's getting DQed or a lot more are getting DQed. Uh, and also our call calendar or our availability on the calendars into the weekend today, Sunday is generally lighter, a little bit lighter. Um, so there's not really places for them to book. So, less availability or options than overall less avail or less booked calls. So, DQing a ton of people plus that. Only 81 calls yesterday that were booked. We had four high ticket buyers which is low for us something on this um because that's like sevenish% and I can actually put a better one. This is how many calls were generated not how many calls were had on day. So this is like the marketing side and then this is the backed out sales side. Um so four high ticket buyers which was actually on day yesterday was only 56 calls on day even though 81 were generated because they can book out 48 hours in advance. Right. So yesterday we had a four units that were actually closed low ticket. I have a whole I can do a whole another video on this, but we have a whole funnel now that feeds off of this and then also gets its own dedicated traffic. Like 90% of them are coming from the dedicated traffic, which is great. New CMO is a rockstar. Um, so low ticket buyers, we had 60 and total cash collected is 37,000. And this is cross company. Uh, some a little bit of active revenue, but mostly new. So that's what I got. I make all these videos just to share this and then so I can look back and be like wow this is where we were and then also like I said find great talent of people who can help us do this in a better way opportunities of other companies and uh softwares and everything and network of people who are doing the same. I just want to jam with people and have friends in the space that are doing the same thing. All right. So, YouTube algo, likes, shares, comments, all the things. Uh Instagram for com uh communication or any ideas you have on what I should be doing. And I will talk with you guys soon.

# We lost $31,914 on ADS in 2 days (thank you Meta) | E24
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC2HEdqT4XA

Today's video is going to be as raw as it gets on what we do when everything feels like it's on fire. In the last two days, we spent $60,000 on ads and made back less than half of it in backend and low ticket purchases. All this is just going to be me sharing what we found that's broken, what we're doing to fix it, and how we look at situations when these happen, where everything feels like it's on fire. All right, last year we did 30 million in cash collected. All this channel is is me sharing what failed clearly what worked and what we are doing actively to scale to 100 million a year. all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people who are doing the same. So, let's get into it. Everything's on fire is what we kind of keep hearing when these things happen. So, 60K in spend between Meta and Google and this is for our back end. So, our main VSSL funnel and our low ticket funnel, but we've only collected four new units, so 23,000 in cash, which is terrible. So, for us, normally this would be like 15 plus units, 1520 even like went bad. uh which is we've never had this in like two to three years where we've had this low of sales per booking on total booking volume. Low ticket we've sold 131 in the last two and a half days um which is high for us and I'll get into kind of where that's breaking things. So to start oops so to start let's just do this. So schedule versus purchase. So historically we've never had success running schedule p uh optimized Facebook ads ever. Like it's always been purchase as a majority of it. We do schedule um almost as like a toggle to make sure that we keep the calendars booked because we can't sometimes get the purchase booking volume high enough and that's where we're at right now. So like 80% of the bookings were coming from schedule which leads to a decrease in the overall funnel optimiz or quality that comes through the funnel. So instead of for us in the past when we've had low calendar that are coming through purchase we just crank up schedule to fill the space because they do still close. It's just a much lower rate. Now this is not working right now. These are backing out historically worse than they ever have. So for us in current state on day we have 142 apps with 33 bookings which is only 23% of apps are booking and that is because with this uh financial disqualifier. So we have it set so it's less than 1K 1 to 5 5 to 10 10 plus or 10 to 10 to 20 and then 20 plus and anybody who's less than 1K gets pushed to not book a call depending on the day and the volume and whatever. But so that what that means is that so many of these apps are disqualified that they're all not able to book, right? So the only bookings that are coming in are quality ideally um but they're coming from both schedule and purchase optimization. What these also then leads to is show rate tanking. So we'll go from a 55 60% to a 45% or a 40% of the shows on calls. So not only do you have less qualified people, you have less count of bookings and you have less of them actually show up for live calls which then leads to something like this. So, we've never historically had this low of sales for booking more than one day ever. And it was been the last two days we had um like two units. It was like one to two units. Technically, it was they were follow-up that came through, but on new it's crazy. So, follow-up DQ automation. So, what I mean by this is we're training our pixel on schedule. And I have other videos about this. Like, we still don't optimize for this because it's I think it's because it's so dirty. So, the changes we made this morning, we got on with CMO who's again absolute rockstar founder. uh other founder is uh very marketing heavy rockstar and I'm just there for moral support. Um but we got on and made a bunch of adjustments inside the ad account to go to purchase to get rid of a bunch of the schedule to yes decrease overall volume but try and get into these pockets of purchase instead of schedule. But I started to think on what was wrong with the schedule and what we have right now is automations that are pushing back to the main booking widget which fires a schedule on everyone in the automation. So like I'm an idiot and I didn't realize that until I I did realize that earlier. I just couldn't come up with a solid way to fix it. And I just fixed it this morning um on we're fixing on SMS now, but we're fixing it on email to where if they answered less than 1K, they live in this automation. If they live answered anything else, they live in this automation. Okay. Now, what that'll do is make it so all the less K less than 1K people get pushed to the DQ booking page, which will not fire the pixel and will land on ramping in kind of newer reps and all the quality will land with the best closers and the best things. I also had someone comment about that saying like, "Oh, that's crazy." And then do you think that they're going to have comparable stats or whatever? And like no, of course we don't. But like listen to any of the top closers, uh, top closer trainers, Horoszi, whatever. It's like you want your best leads to land with your best closers. We're not saying, oh, you're though that should be compared to somebody who's ramping or new, but there is a baseline. They still should be closing f five to 8% sales per booking and then push up there once you give them more qualified. And also all of them are on both bookings. So you still get all of them. It's just who gets more of them based on priority. So, financial qualifier debro uh broken. As soon as I fixed this, oops. As soon as I fixed this automation, I realized people were answering multiple because someone had popped into the form and made it so the financial qualifier could be answered multiple questions. Uh, and I found this a couple days ago and it's mapped so many places. I didn't fix it, but now it's critical that it is. So, someone could answer less than 1K, 1 to 5K, 5 to 10, and like all these different ones. And if any of them said less than 1K, they were getting routed out even if those are generally quality because it means that they have spent up to 10K but also less than 1K in their mind. So we toggled. So we fixed that whole thing, remapped it, swapped out the form, changed the question, the routing, the just all the things this morning uh as well. So that'll increase quality that comes through or more so allow the quality people to book into the right widget. I'm getting tech issues over here. 15 bookings or so in like the last two or three days have come in as men which we only serve women. So we like instant cancel them. So it takes up spots and then obviously is taking spend. So we go in and we find that Google was targeting they're running a test basically where it was all and the test clearly got too much traction. Not cool. So turned that off and it was targeting all and we got rid of because it's on um on Google it is women, men, and unknown. And we just went down to just women. So the other one had unknowns and then one even had men on it. So we turned that off. Our Google media buyer is like a sicko. Does everyone's uh stuff in the space. So, not to say it was like a bad idea to do, but just for us being women only, it did not back out and was getting us too many bookings that were coming from men. Too many low ticket. What I mean by this, we are ramping an entire marketing setup division with a new CMO and all of the things in the VSSL funnel and then also launching low ticket all at the same time while then launching an entire setter team with now six setters and like a week and a half onboarded. And I have other videos of how much like cash collected we had and like them firing off, but then everything at once hitting is stress and is like us trying to navigate that. So what I mean by too many low ticket is when this financial qualifier is hit or this DQ is hit, they're getting routed to buy the low ticket. So you have those plus all the ad spend on it. And why too many? And the only reason I say too many is because oh I'll wait on those is because of this bottom portion here which is basically the setters take the calls on the back end. So someone buys the Otto is to book a call and the booking call is an implementation call not a closer call and it's with a setter. So if they don't have the calendar availability or we don't have reps that are ramped that can take the calls yet they're going into like nowhere land. Okay. So big issue and I just found out that this uh that this morning where the sale the setter calendars were broken and not connected properly in Calendarly. So one didn't have Zoom connected. So all the all the bookings that are coming in have no Zoom and or can't book. And then somebody else had their uh availability broken to where they had an out of office across the entire thing. So they couldn't get open spots. We were supposed to be able to take 60 of them and they were only able to book out until like Tuesday and today is Saturday. So instantly got in, fixed all that and shortened the time. So now people can book today, tomorrow, all that because just on a calendar break center data management. I then went in and went into the pieces and like our outbound director also Siko comes with experience and is like crushing it but like doesn't necessarily know our systems. So doesn't have the experience with our specific setup to know like where to look for the data and where things are maybe not getting filled in. So we're not getting auto set versus self-s set filtered. Uh they're not changing from call schedule to deal outcome. like just stuff that ramping reps and new people are going to like struggle with making sure they do all the things. Data was all skewed in there. People weren't changing calls scheduled over. They weren't changing auto set versus self set. And like they're crushing it. Like their stats are good uh on the ones they close and how they backed out. But that in between I don't know how many are no-showing cancelling. Can I solve for that with better automations? Um are they financially dqed? Um are they too far out on the calendar so they're no showing? Like I I can't have I can't make decisions unless I have the correct data. and that was all broken. Um, and then getting into this one, split testing. So, I shared on this channel specifically split testing stuff on how the control was basically still winning in comparison to the two variations, but then variation two was also like very close and is closer in branding and all that. So, we want to turn that on. I am like as big of an idiot as it comes. All of the email traffic and automations for opt uh step one of the uh low ticket and step two. So the one for step one is they gave us name and email and then didn't purchase. So we push them back to the purchase page. And then for the people that purchased but then didn't book a call, we push them back to there. Okay. For the main one, for the push to book or push to purchase, I had it all going to the control page. So yeah, it has comparable units and it has like this higher uptick and like it's beating the control. Yeah, all of them are funding to that or filling to that. So completely skewed the data on the split test. We still have the front-end data and we still have the purchase data and now we just know like it's clear that the variation is winning based on that. But like by how much I can't even tell you. So super annoying with self that we didn't set up a standalone. So now we set up a standalone page that has all the tracking back to the pixel doing all the things. And then we changed all the email traffic to go there. So like that'll clean the data. And then on the booking page it's sending back to the control which has like a 20% book rate and the split has like a 70% book rate. So changed it to that one. So, like just there, we probably dropped um we cleaned the stats up and then we probably increased the call rate by 20 30%. Like on how many of them were booking. So, not actually affected the CPA or anything like that because like they all still work. But just crazy just crazy to see that I let that happen. So, I don't know. This is definitely not a case study video. This is just like an excited to look back video because I made a video saying that we did 1.59, I believe. Yeah, last month. And that is terrible for us. like we bleed when that happens and lose money because the team is so big because of the spends because like everything. Um, and we're okay with that. You know, obviously want to go up, but like I just want to be able to share raw stuff like that so you guys can see getting too many comments that are like, "Oh, of course you did. Of course this and that." And like, you know, sharing not true. It's like, "Why would I share that we lost money if we didn't?" Like, so yeah, all these are just me raw doing this. Um, how I'm thinking through this process, how we're optimizing fix this, and like total conviction that we'll get it back on track in the next x amount of days. Uh, I will go back to making videos on how-tos and case studies and things of where we're where we're at. But yeah, excited to be able to look back on this in a month or six months or a year and be like, "Wow, we were losing money month over month or day over day and we flipped it on its head, turned it around, scaled it up to sicko levels, three, five, 10 million a month." So yeah, that's all I got today. Drop comments. I don't know. I think that feeds the algo. Likes, Instagram for coms. Talk soon.

# We LOST $1.1 MILLION on a Deal. here is what I learned | E23
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV5y1J8eHfk

In today's video, I'm going to share how we lost $1,164,029 on a bad partnership. I'm going to share why we got in the partnership in the first place, why we kept it going when it was bleeding, the money in money out exact accounting, the funnel and where it was breaking down, and our plan going forward with this partnership and partnerships alike. All right. Last year, we did 30 million in cash collected in our women's fitness coaching business. And I share everything on this channel, no BS, no fluff, to show what failed, what worked, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities, and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, why we even did this. This entire thing was LTV focused. All right, so to add value to the customer and to increase the customer experience. So like I said, women's fitness business that right now all we sell is a $7,200 a year annual coaching program. So, the only way that we make more money is them to renew and buy more. Okay? And Hormosi has a ton of really good videos about this. Um, but basically with the focus on LTV, you can have other things you sell them, right? Is the simplest way to say this. It's either sell them more or you sell them other things. Okay? Now, for us, we didn't want to do the focus on starting up a supplement company from scratch and doing that on the side as a second business or inside of this business. And we didn't want to lose the focus on the main business. So, like I said, Hormosi videos are really good about this if you want to look at at deeper into this, but finding a solid partnership where another company has your ideal customer profile um as the exact same and they want they will buy the same things is huge. So, we found a company that does supplements and like testing kits. So, essentially the customer gets sent a test kit in the mail. They do swabs and stuff like that. send the test kit back, gets all the results, get on the phone with somebody from the company to review the results and then give recommendations to supplements that are essentially the core ones that like everyone should be taking for health and then the customized and personalized stuff based on their levels of different things. Okay, so for us, the goal of this was to do it for every single purchaser that came through on the back end to increase that customer experience, add the value to have the nutrition and like health side of it covered more, but not start our own supplement company. So, initially we had, I believe, 25 to 30% as commissions and we got it up to 40%. The money in money out is where it breaks. Um, but essentially we were buying a test kit for every single customer that came in. So, someone would get on a sales call with us, they would join our program, they'd pay us 7,200 and from that 7,200, we would pay 275 to 350ish uh for a test kit for that person instantly. So, we would take everything from the terms, we would send it over to the other company, they would process it and send a test kit to them by mail. Okay. So, in 2024 alone, I pulled this from QuickBooks, we spent 1,258,19,452, if that's how you say that. Um, but we spent like 1.2. We did we spent 1.25 million on test kits alone. Okay, that's our only direct expense. 2024 earned from this in the commissions from the actual sales 83,000ish and this year to date 11,234. Okay. Now to be clear this number is going to consistently go up but not that much. Okay. So like next month we'll maybe make another two three four grand. The next month we'll make you know two three grand. The next month we'll make one two whatever that is because this is a recurring thing. So that's why we initially got into this because we said, "Okay, we don't want to start our own supplement company. We want to find somebody that aligns with our values and missions." And as a side point, none of this is to say that their company is bad, the products are bad, the business is bad, anything. Nor is it to say ours is. It's the the combination and how we handled the partnership and how the math backed out where it just wasn't a good deal for both parties. Well, I mean, it's probably really good for them because they made 1.2 on us, but we it the the value exchange was not there for this to be a good partnership into the future. Okay. So, we only made 83K last year on 1.2 in and that is a breakdown of 40% of the purchases. Okay? And I'll go through the math on the funnel right here. But all of this to say, if we would have done this in-house, it would have been a giant shift in focus, but doing it out of house and not having the numbers dialed and control over the funnel and where the things break down was a huge issue. Okay, so funnel breakdown. I'm actually going to go down here to start. So, like I said, right now someone would buy our we're calling this our backend purchase. So, our high ticket program 7200, the terms would happen. They would go into our system and begin our program. But for the funnel that is specific to the partnership, the kit would be sent to them. They would complete the registration, which basically means that they would send the kit back, right? They would sign up for an account online. They would uh register the kit and they would send it back. Then they would attend the call once they get the results in and then they would purchase a product. Okay? So now across these on this testing window and what all this data is based on is 3,91 kits. Okay. So I have like a full sheet on all this and this was six months ago or so now um that this data was from. So to be clear that's when this entire data window is um 3,91 were sent a test kit. Meaning we had 3,91 high ticket purchasers that came into our company that we then sent a test kit and just bump 250 30 350 whatever the number was that we paid on the kit. Okay. of those that came back and sent their kit back only 53% did. Okay, so first funnel breakdown issue that is both on us that is on the expectations and that is on that company. Okay, because we're sending the kit and just passing off the customer clearly did not work right. So where can we be in control of that? Our coaches, our back and forth, our our communication, hey, make sure you send your kit. It's like integral for you to start. It's, you know, including your onboard. It's a requirement. We did do a better job of this. And back to why I said like why we kept going when we knew it was bleeding because it was getting better. It just never backed out. But like it was worse than this and then it got better than this. And like we kept trying to do that. But in the end, the math overall didn't work. But we started to put in things in place like in our road map and onboarding flow that you needed to register your kit and all the benefits and uh why you need to get all those answers. But still only 53%. So on my numbers here, if 1.2 2 million was spent and 50 of them even registered the kit. We just burned 600 G's before we even started, right? Like not good. Um, so 600 grand just out just on that alone. The next how many once sending back the kit got on the call? 70%. Better still not great. It's like you just took the time to swab and do all the things but and sent your test kit back but then you didn't get on the call with the actual rep. Now this was business issues too. like there was not call availability. Calls would get bumped. Uh new reps were getting onboarded because we were pushing in so many to their business like that it didn't make it wasn't optimal. It wasn't optimized for their inside their business. Um so 70% got on a phone call and then of that unique about 400 purchase. So then 24% from here. So the breakdown here 50% issue here in communication requirements that's on us that's on them. How many attended the call after the kit was in there? Again, we can take some responsibility for that. They can as well. And then purchase. This is what happens on that phone call. This one, yes, we kind of can as well, but that's like them and their conversion rates and how they close. So, like I said, kits, registration, call completion, purchase, AOV, $140 on a purchase. Okay, so these are recurring buys and that was why we were like, "Oh, the math might back out into the future." Is this like phantom LTV and MR number that we based everything on and it was wrong and that's why I'm like so keen on uh data. And even if the AOV is 140, we're only making 40% of that or whatever. So call it 56 bucks, which I don't even know. Is that right? Close to right. 74. Yeah, that's right. So commission on average being $56 of these purchasers. So like to catch up to what we're paying in 350 or 300 to for the test kit was a big jump that we just never got to. So what's the plan going forward? So all of this is really and more so plan going forward is like what LTV boosters exist is probably a better way to say this. So for us the main focus right now is retention. So we have an entire retention team around this and just doing the more of the same model in current form. Okay. So once someone's 60 days out from their renewal, we schedule a call with them with a dedicated retention team that are actually old sales pod leaders. So like um uh they basically had 10 to 15 sales uh team members under them in management and also being a top sales rep. So those two have now left over there and gone to the back end of the company to do retention. So selling more of the same. All we're selling is the exact same annual coaching program just for 1K off. Okay. So instead of uh 7200 it's 6200 and they push that. What we're building out now is this downell and contin continuity. So building out an offer that is a downell in a way because it'll be less dollars um but will be continuous uh continuity and will just highlight the points of why they want to stay. So a lot of people stay for community. They stay for continued accountability. Do they stay for the personalization? Like there's all the different pieces of the current offer that can be stripped down to why does someone actually stay once they get past that first year of education, uh, understanding, progress, results, all that. So, that's what we're building out right now and it exists. Okay. Other ways that I've seen and heard people talk about and what has been recommended to us, sell your data. Like, no, we don't do that. We're not a fan of that. Um, a lot of people will take in, so like right now we'll run 30 G's a day to a VSSL callunnel that will have name and email that is the opt-in. I know so many people that will then split that list out and sell those leads instantly out as well as like pixel data and stuff like that. Like that's just not something we are comfortable with. And maybe that's stupid, but I also don't know if it's legal, but we just don't do that and we're not fans of that. So people do that with their leads, their apps, and their customers. And down this you get more and more value or you can sell them for more because the customer who just paid 7200 is worth more than a name and email of someone who's just interested in menopause or macronutrients or whatever. Okay. Now, a key thing on here though that is real and true is we only sell 1% of our leads. So, of our current flow, we'll get a hundred uh leads a day. Only one of those people buy our $7,200 program. So, like your math has to back out. And like right now, we're struggling with this. And I have other videos of like where we're currently at. We did 30 million last year, but last month we did like 1.6 million, which is terrible. Um, and trying to turn that around. And the way you do that is just making more money per lead, per app, per customer over time against your advertising costs if you have them, right? You could lean more in organic. You can do all these things. But cross-ell partnerships, and this is back to how we would want to do a model like this, but like the right way. So supplements, again, there's a way to do it. Hormosi literally did this in his business model and I know so many people who do it where it's almost like a requirement when you join. It's like you're going to need creatine, whey protein, uh you know, greens, this and that as your baseline. Like you need them. And now for us, we just didn't do this for a long time because we didn't know who had quality enough supplements where would also make sense in the math. And what we've also come to learn is like a business that is conversion focused, not just like a brand, because it's helpful to be able to just pass the customer off because we might as well make our own supplements if we're going to run the entire sales process and this and this. I mean, obviously there's fulfillment and like harder issues there. So, not to not to discount their business model, but like the ability to sell them and keep them would be very nice if we could just pass it off to somebody and they would just handle it with a customer that's ready to buy or we do the initial purchase, they handle everything after, stuff like that. swag. We already do this a little bit, but we just break even on this. But I know a bunch of companies who do this. But for us, again, all of these have not been that um like sexy to us to do because we're only selling when we were at peak, like 400 and something units a month. So, this just looked like small dollars in comparison, which is kind of like small thinking because these add up and we can get to 20, 50, 100k a month in recurring supplement income that we maybe wouldn't have any costs on because it would just be an affiliate commission, right? Okay. And that was the goal of what we did here. It just never backed out. Um, swag, same thing. So, these are both volume plays as well as MR or on this. And this is more so all just a volume play. We do this right now, but we just break even. And both these for us are extremely important that they're quality. So, you're not getting like a shitty t-shirt that you're never going to wear or that has like bad material or breaks down after four. You're not getting a supplement that has 19 unknown things in it. Like, this extremely important that we keep our brand integrity throughout this. Um, so that's why we haven't done these two, but like both are definitely an opportunity. And then premium health services. This is something new that we heard about. Um, where other companies that are similar to us basically have like an an upsell on top. So if you're selling it for 7,200 a year, you'll then have like an 11K offer or like, you know, a 4K add-on that for the year you also get like a dedicated health services style thing. So they do like full blood panels. they do full um like just overall health testing and things beyond the scope of what you do with nutrition, exercise, like accountability in those pieces. Uh and I think that's an interesting one to think about because the people who are coming in and paying 7200 are interested in that or already do some version of this. So to encompass it all inside our crew is good. Um plus+ is just like anything else we have now with what we're doing with low ticket that is technically an ascension play and an LTV play. It's super small cuz it's like a $37 front end, but there's that. Um, and then other things in this scope are like building out full ecosystems, having full continuity programs that are like membership and community based. Um, having deals with the different like health tech companies because we always talk about Aura rings and eight sleep pods and all these different things. So, it's just about volume and having a good partner that you can pass it off to. Uh so yeah, so this is basically how we lost all this and we turned it off where we no longer provide these kits on the front end early in 2025 and we have noticed no difference in customer experience and yeah so lesson learned and hopefully we find some solid partnerships where we can do this because I'm a huge fan of MR and if we can do that that would be super good. All right, so DM me on Instagram if you have any questions, comment on YouTube, subscribe on YouTube and let me know. production.

# we launched a low ticket and did $34,161 in 6 days... here's how. | E22
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8KJVaGZxno

In today's video, I'm going to share how we did $34,161 in six days testing digital products. We're going to go through all the metrics that are important to us, like how many front-end purchases we had, how many calls he's generated for the different teams, the back-end purchases of our high ticket program, and the ascension rates through them. We're going to do a deep dive across all the metrics throughout the entire funnel, and then a plan as to what we're going to do with optimizations where we're going to take this thing and examples at the different rates. All right. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected all through a high ticket VSSL call funnel. And I make all the videos on this channel just to share what failed, what worked and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, what I mean by digital products in this for us is a low ticket info product that we are selling with the goal of ascending them into our back-end high ticket program. Okay. So for purchases, just getting straight into it, we had across this range of testing 153. I have other videos on the channel where I go through kind of our ideology here and how we're and why we're going from uh high ticket only to low ticket on the front end. Uh and that's part of our plan to get to this 100 million a year mark. So of those low ticket purchases, it's a $37 AOV right now, which is $5,661 in cash collect on the front. That generated oops 77 calls with setters. From those 77 calls with setters, we have 32 that then went to closers that were pre-framed over. Back-end purchases, we had five by our high ticket back-end program, which is $28,000 in cash collected, 20,500 technically, uh, in back-end purchases, which is a 3.2% ascension rate on units. All right, so that's where we're coming up with our 34,161. So, let me get into the entire funnel and then we'll go into the metrics. So, right now, we're actually only running Facebook. uh Google starts today and it's April 2nd, 2025. Um so Google starts today, but right now all meta traffic and even that in itself has like 92 variations and splits and new ads that are going and not splits but you know new ads that are testing that we're going through. Um but as of now we're running a three-way split across this six-day range that is basically three like complete funnels. So the sales page is splitting but then goes to a checkout page that's splitting that goes to a booking. So all are actually like one singular split. So all the same design across one. All the same design across one. Meaning you can't go from this variation to this control, right? Um so I'm going to go through the metrics across all of these, but essentially someone lands on a sales page, they give the name and email to land on the checkout page. Uh so it's like a two-step. Then on the checkout page, they purchase the Otto. In a lot of low tickets, you're going to have like upsells and try and increase AOV with add-ons and cross cells and things like that. We do not have any of that because our goal is to get them on the calendar to then talk to a setter and then talk to a sales rep. Okay. So, for us, it's a booking widget that then goes on the setter calendar where they then land on a thank you page with a like questionnaire application they can put on. Um, that's also very valuable and information because we found the more people that fill this out uh and the deeper that they fill this out, the more info um or the more likely they are to close. Um, so they land in this call scheduled. Then I'm going to go through the different outcomes that can happen from the setter call itself. So no show cancel follow-up close lost close one uh which is a set in this case that then lands in a call scheduled for the closer calendar and then how they land in the buckets for no show cancel all the things uh down to close one. All right now starting with the front end of the funnel. This is the control. So this is how many views the actual control had. And you'll see the difference here on these. Um I'm using VWO for all these stats and like it's as close as it can be. Um, but just take that for granted or take that as like a grain of salt. Um, with a grain of salt. Jeez. Uh, so these different ones are going to have different traffic based on a 33 33 33 split. And in the middle, I'll show you, but we turned this one off and that's why it has lower. Okay, so this date range is constantly like across this date range is this data, but it's constantly in flow and in motion because people can be in these different steps and then come back to them later. Um, and I'll show you that right there. So across this test, we had the control was getting a 10% uh that are doing the one step. So they're giving name and email and going to the checkout page. Of those people who purchased, so 62 buyers, so 123 people opted in, gave us name and email. 62 of them then purchased. So 10% rate from here to here, 50% rate from here to here, and then 27% of them booked a call with a setter. Okay, not great right here. These are very solid right now. The variation one is essentially like a lighter design that is uh like completely rebranded, but the is like light versus dark on these. So on this one, we had a 7.9. Not as good. We had uh not as good on the checkout and not as good or better, I'm sorry, way better on the book a call. Okay. So, of those that came through, we had 20 calls that popped out, which is really the optimization point uh that we're going for because it continues it down the funnel. So yes, the math would be better on this because you'd have um 43% that are actually purchasing through um I'm sorry uh you know what I mean? So we'll have 34 that are buying out of that pocket. So you are getting more dollars but you're not getting what you actually like what the goal is on the back end. So then of the variation two we had 9% uh on the v on the opt-in page portion of the checkout. Then 53% of those actually checked out from um the and turned into an actual purchaser. So 57 of those 53% and then this one has a 70% booking rate. Okay. So when we were looking at all this data essentially we're like okay so two is just losing right like if you look at um the total count of purchases across this range. It's like 62 versus 34 versus 57. Basically with the same traffic. Now the reason this one's lower like I said is because we actually turned this one off like a day into uh a day ago. So 5 days into the test now all the traffic will run to these two. Why we're continuing to run this is because one, it's branded and more in style of what we're going for. Two, it is getting a better backout rate on this, which is more important. And that's a a lot to do with how this page is designed right here on this Otto booking page. Um, so this one is better in like a lot of ways. And it also backs out better, okay, into this, which is the most important. Now, um, we're going to go through here and then I'll go back to these on how we can optimize, but of that total across this range, we had 77 calls, right, across these that then land on a set calendar. Now, again, I want to like emphasize the data on here is as accurate as it can be. But because people get stuck into these stage, like whatever this is, 153. Yeah, we said 153 purchases across here. Only 77 booked. That does not mean that 77 are ever going to book. like by the time that I refresh this, we could have 80 of these calls that came from these purchases. And because we're actively running traffic, it the the data is constantly like updating itself as who's in the pipeline of things that can go to the next step. So if you turned off ads, all of your numbers would climb over time theoretically because you would have people that then book on calendars later that then buy later. And how long is that sales cycle versus this 5day snapshot and picture which is like as best as we can do for an example like this. Okay, so 77 calls scheduled with setters. Now, of those 14 no showed, four cancelled, 14 are in follow-up, which is basically like they're not ready yet to take the step, but like keep them on the radar. Close loss, meaning like completely not interested, disqualified due to financial, any of those things. And then closed one, which we are is a set, right? So, when when you win a setter call, it's a closed set. Okay? Now, those 32 carry over. So 41% of these calls scheduled made it onto a closer calendar. All right. So going back through here on this you have right you have 40 calls. Let's just use this one as an example. Of the 107 optins you got 57 purchases. 40 of those booked a call. Now into here 32 of them have now set with a closer. Okay. Okay. So, of those 32 that are on a closer calendar, important here, these are pre-frame. These are like excited. They have context on what's happening. They didn't just like cold book. They're not just direct from ads. Like way juicier than just your VSSL direct. So, one no-show, seven cancels, 10 hot listings, two low ticket follow, or I'm sorry, long-term. I use LT twice. So, long-term follow-up. So, a hot listing is basically going to mean that somebody is um like in the queue, has to talk to husband, uh interested, qualified, just like hasn't gotten over the finish line. Uh long-term follow-up is someone who needs six months, needs three months to, you know, get funds together or it's not in the time and place in their life. Closed, lost, DQ, financially not qualified, um not interested, not a fit, whatever. And then closed one, we had five. So, 15.6% sales per booking, which is solid for us. Um so backing into this why these things would happen and where we can do optimizations. Okay so starting here just in toggling this one for example as full traffic will get us a call it 50% lift. Okay. And which will then drop costs in the same way because all of these you got to look at this as as and I'll go into examples down here of like the different costs and breakdowns across. But if you take this entire thing all the way netted out, we got five units on in total 153 purchases, which is a 3.2% ascension rate. Now, every single step of this can go up 1%, 5%, 20%. And as you do that, that ascension rate climbs because that that ascension rate is essentially like the sum total of all of these different percents. Okay. So, what we can do with these different layers and what we are doing. So, first things first, this so we're crowning these and likely we'll crown this one as a winner. Um, from here you can do a million other splits. You can do design splits, you can do headline splits, you can do complete offer splits, you can do like a million in one things. The these are like communication buckets is like what I'm calling them. So when somebody opts in but does not purchase. So on this this for example, we have 53%. Okay, so the first drop off point is how many people land on the ad and then opt in. So 90% of people don't give us their name and email. There are tools and things you can do to capture email and like rep push them to that. Not something we're interested in this time. We're only going to start with our communication on people who are name and email. So, they give it to us, but then 45% of them do not purchase. So, we have their name and email. We can remarket them. Um, and we do that right now with a push to purchase. So, it's an email sequence that goes back and forth and just pushes them there. It's not optimized. It's not built like the best way. So, right there, that could go from 53 to 58%. Call it. All right. Push to book. Same thing here. So now you have somebody who purchased but did not book a call and in this one it's cranking 70% is like fantastic but let's say we want to get to 75% like how would we do that? So a couple ways you can do email you have their phone number so you can do SMS because you have your phone number you can now have setters assigned here to dial out and get bookings from this directly um and other ways basically that and they sit in there and again this is across this date window of call it whatever this five or six day date window. If we turn everything off right now, this number could climb to 42 45. Like as they consume the product, you have CTAs in product. Um they're inside the community, they decide to book in a week or three weeks or a month. Uh and that's the beauty of this is these are buyers that now are inside of your network and inside of your system and in communities and in product and consuming content and doing all that and then will book and will buy later. Okay, so push to book, that's another one. And then push to app. We're not even leaning on this at all, but this is essentially people who did book with a setter but didn't fill out an application. um or like a like a questionnaire. It's not even the same application as the main. It has different info and different like what are your goals gathering a lot of free form to see like what they're interested in. So all of these as an example, you could get a 5% lift here and a 5% lift here and that'll dramatically change things as they go down the funnel. Now of those 77 that land with setters, the big thing that stands out to me here is 28 of these were no shows or cancels. So the automations to get people to show like the show rate uh like best practices are not even in place on this. We literally have nothing. We have like the two calendarly automated like hey your calls at this time hey your calls at this time. We have no preframe. We have no um like dynamic messaging. We have no direct SOP for setters on how they should handle these. We have no HubSpot branded email about like what you should prepare in your call. None of that. So this right here we could drop to 10 total. So right now if it's 18, let's say we get it to 10 of them no show and cancel. And if you're assuming that 41% of them become uh schedules or become with the closer call, like just that alone, you'd get four more bookings with closers. And obviously that's like blended math, so it doesn't like completely back out. But you know what I mean? Like if you could have three to four or more sets that would come from these because you have no idea if these people are qualified, if they canceled or no ship. You have no idea, right? You don't know if they land in this closed lost or follow-up. So optimizing around that doesn't exist yet. Now getting on with closer. These cancel and no-shows are interesting because this is like very low percentage which is amazing. Um but like cancels more so the no-shows. So what generally happens with somebody who cancels is yes something comes up every once in a while or like that's the number one excuse is something came up. I have work, I have a kid thing, I have something but generally what happens is they're researching you and you haven't done a good enough job of doing like pre-objection blocks. So you're not sending them the oh, you know, a loom of you explaining the reviews and how people online say it's 10k and people online say it's $40 a month and like all these different things and all of them are wrong and it's completely customized to the person and check out all these, you know, 300 reviews on Trust Pilot and like building that rapport because this is them doing their own research and then coming up with a reason on why they want to cancel. And you need to do a better job, we us included, and we need to do this on our VSSL funnel and our low ticket funnel, but do a better job of getting ahead of these and in front of these and having the proper framing to do so. So 10 of them landing in hot listing is like great. That's basically a closer like a not I don't say issue, but like a closer metric. So that's saying that 10 of them are basically ready and do qualify and likely have the funds and they just didn't get over the finish line. So optimizing your closers around this is fantastic. Um as like the goal long-term follow-up, these are just what they are. Also kind of a closer thing. Close loss. This generally speaking is like DQ. So it's could be optimized here by making it so the setters didn't even push them over to here because they're not interested in the product because they don't have the funds because they don't whatever. So this could be optimized by having less calls that actually come through. So all the percents will go up into the correct buckets of like uh total allocated. And then five closed one. Great. like 15% sales per booking is sol would be really solid for us on the VSSL funnel. Um our goal for this one is higher than that. Okay. Now let's say you blend this entire thing across. If you have again 10ish here solid you have 55 to 60ish here solid. You have 70 I mean 70 is fantastic but like if you hold that then you optimize around here to have less no-shows and cancels right the setters are brand new too. So we have setters and this low ticket with all the ads and stuff. Both of them are brand new. So none of this is optimized even in like the person itself and their skill, let alone the actual system and the network there. Um, but if we get all these percents up and go through here on this, we could have 60% of these and we could have this number closer to 100. Okay. And just in us changing this to be the uh variation two as like the main part of the funnel. The differences on this backout is would be higher than 100. Right? All right. If 70% of these are coming through and we had 153 bookings, like that in itself is whatever 110, whatever. I can't do that math right now. Um, so 77 would back out in a call scheduled, it would be 120. Assume the same percents across that, you know, the same proportional amount are going to know cancel that increases this. But if we solve for this, it increases this even more. This same thing that units would be seven, it would be nine, would be 11. And then all of this exactly again like I said over time. Okay. So, what my plan is is essentially to do these uh automations around here as the core piece. And we can uh introduce things like our AI SMS bot that we have uh Mandy Macros. I have other videos on this, but we have an AI bot that can message back and forth with complete context. So, it can say, "Oh, hey, you know, um so and so, I saw that you applied is the current use case we use, but like booked but didn't, you know, fill out your app or tried to purchase this and didn't or purchased but didn't book a call." And it can do those different automations with different uh goal like actions called actions split tests across this. So like I said right now we just got rid of this one. The control and this are still running. We're kind of just running the control just because it technically has higher stats on the on the uh purchases, but overall it's like not where we're going with brand in terms of design and it's also not where we're going um with splits like the ability to split and and uh and how the offer structured. So, it's going to be this and then likely what'll happen is we'll roll out two, three, four more of these of different things as the bonuses, different offers, different pieces there. Okay, optimizations basically what I talked about just different optimizations across this whole thing and knowing your numbers is like the number one thing for me at least. So, I can't make any decisions without knowing all these numbers and being able to because these can drive like basically behavior changes and decision um decision-m which is like the entire point of all this for me at least. Um and then AOV booster. So right now we are collecting $37 per on here and we are doing nothing to get more money. Nothing. And a lot of low ticket people and how they do it is it's like this true like economics game of how you do it where it's $37 on the front then there's a $197 upsell but then a 97 $97 downell. If you take the first upsell you there's a $397 and you get your AOV up to like $150. So that if your cost per uh purchase on the front end, which is the whole thing, is $75, like you're making double your money. If your AOV is uh 150 and your cost per purchase is 75, that's not the game we're playing because we're optimizing for this. Now, if we threw something in here that was like a $97 upsell after this purchase and then had a booking widget, for example, or only had the booking widget after an email or only in the product, yes, your economics would be better, but because we have a sales team, because we need to fill calendars and the goal is to have this start to take over a portion of how many calls are on day or fill a portion of the calendars, the volume is just too low and the time span is just too long in order to do that. Um, so not to say we will never play that game, but in this model specifically, it is built to be a a direct ascension funnel, not an economics play. Okay? But what we can do in AOV boosters is at this stage right here, um, so this post purchase, I'm sorry, I mean at this page on this checkout page, we can do order bumps. So statistically, according to a lot of sources, that it doesn't really affect conversion rate that much. All it does more or less is increase AOV. So in this case, we're selling a uh ultimate guide to macronutrients is the entire thing is about fitness. Um we can have a recipe book as an upsell. We can have so if you want like the more of the same model, you can have recipes. You can have like the master class that is like an advanced version or like the quick start guide. Um and then if you want to go into the direction of like what else do they need next? That's going to be workouts uh exercise style because you went from nutrition to exercise. But we can lean way more into likely a lot of this is obvious like this entire thing is being run by the CMO. He crushes it. He's doing all this is me sharing data about it and what the team is doing, not necessarily what I'm doing. Um, but having that as the uh AOV boost, we could go from $37 to $50 and that would completely change the economics. We could go to $75 or higher and as we begin to scale like CPA theoretically and you know proven is going to rise. So being able to match that. Now, examples of this in current state, we're about this one, but like let's say so you have a $10 net. So what $10 net means is that you have $37 purchase for example and it cost you $47 to get that purchase on on ads. Okay? So you spent 47 on uh Facebook, $37 back per unit. Now that's 10 net. So it really only cost you $10 to get them to the next stage of the funnel. And we can do all the math on this, but we'll be here for an hour and a half. But then you could basically divide that out. So if right here is that number, if 70% of those are booking a call, what's your cost per set call? Right? It's 13 bucks or whatever that is, right? Because if 70% of them are booking, I can't do that math right now, but let's say it's 50%. So it's easy. It would be double that. Okay? So, if it cost you $10 net to get a purchase, 50% of them booked, it would then cost you $20 to get a setter call. If you know that again, 50% of them schedule out and now it's $40 to get them on the phone with a sales rep. And if it and 10% sales per booking would be uh um what I say, $40 would be $400 cost per purchase, right? So, like that's how the mon the math funnels down. So, in the case of a 3% ascension, so we're just going to use 1% as the total versus purchases versus back-end purchases because it's the easiest one. And how you get to the 3% is blending all these percents. All right. And the quick math, and these are super simple numbers, um, but and totally oversimplified, but $10 net is going to be with a 3% ascension rate would be a 30 $333 CPA on the backend product. With a $50 net and the same ascension rate, it would be 1,600. With a $75 net, meaning it cost you whatever $110, $20 in ads to get a $37 buyer, right? That $75 net. 3% ascension rate would be a $2,500 CPA. So, our target is sub$,500. Okay. So, now, how do you need to change the math to get your net both in your CPA and your AOV to be a solid number in here and then also get your ascension rate to be like as high as possible? Like if I look at the stats from last month essentially when we were like test running this and all of this is date ranges and moving numbers if I look total versus across a week across a month. Um but like last month ours was 3.98 current month to date which is two or three days in it's like three. Okay. And if we stopped running ads tomorrow that number would slowly just increase until it was like five which is great. Um but that's not the case. We want to scale into this and sell a few hundred a day. So 50 this is basically where we're sitting right now. Now, the other model is what happens if we can optimize this entire funnel with everything I said here and got this to a 5% ascension rate. That same number gets you a $200 CPA. So, same net, just just a higher ascension rate because your funnel is built better and because your and your structure is built better. $200 CPA. 5% on this is a $1,000 CPA and 5% on this is a $1,500 CPA. Okay, so this is the model. Um, so how do we get this up from three to four to five across here? And then how do we keep that CPA or that net CPA down by both increasing AOV, decreasing ad costs, and like better optimizations there, sales page splits, and then the entire funnel. So, just want to give an update on kind of where we started and where we're at with this. And yeah, goal is to get this up to a couple hundred a day. This is just one niche, one product. I have other videos on the channel where I talk about how we did uh how our plan is like evolving and how we're thinking about different niche products or different messaging products that are uh low ticket as well as paired with the VSSL funnel. Um, but yeah, these are the current stats where we're at. And as always, Instagram for communication. Uh, it's in bio on here. And then comment, subscribe, all the things on what kind of content you want me to share. So, have a good week.

# We hired Setters and made $34,700 in 5 days. here's how. | E21
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elqaSccAFko

In today's video, I'm going to share how we did $34,700 in the first five days of having setters. I'm going to go through what we call auto sets versus self sets, the difference between them, and the stats behind them, the current buckets of traffic that we are giving setters across the funnel. And then if you stay till the end, you're going to see the future buckets of where we intend on implementing setters as well as optimizations to those current buckets. All right. So, last year we did 30 million in cash collected and I make all the videos on this channel just to share what did work, what did not work, and what we're actively doing now to scale to 100 million a year. All with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a network of people doing the same. All right, so let's get into it. So, first things first, the difference between an auto set and a self set. Okay, so for us, we're calling an auto set. Basically, people who directly book in with a setter through a calendar widget versus them dialing the CRM, finding, you know, dialing 100, getting five to pick up, and then having one set. All right, that's a self set versus an auto set. And I'll go through why that's a little bit more important later. Um, but here's the overall funnel. I have different videos on the channel that go way more in depth into this, but it's relevant for this video to see uh just kind of quick overview. So, as of now, we have two different main funnels. You have the VSSL funnel up here and then you're going to have the low ticket funnel down here. All right, both of these are getting cold traffic direct to them. But just as a quick overview, VSSL uh name and email on the opt-in page, watch the VSSL, then land on an application uh 16 17 questions where we get the phone number for the first time. Depending on their answers, specifically on a financial qualifier, they're going to land either on a higher quality booking page, then be able to book the call, get on a sales call, and talk to a sales rep and close. And if not and they have a lower financial qualifier, they're going to go into this DQ routing that is going to either put them with lower quality closers or ramping closers or push them over here to the low ticket. All right. Now, the low ticket funnel direct has its own traffic to it where it is a two-step order form or a two-step sales page basically. So, the first one you're going to collect name and email. They're going to go to a checkout page where they're going to be able to complete checkout. Then they are going to be asked to book a call. Um that call is a 15-minute Zoom slot and that is with a setter, not a closer. Okay. then land here, ask for some app, and then they get on the phone with a setter. All right, so for the auto set, what I'm referring to specifically is these calls right here. And in current state, it's the only bucket that it exists. Okay, so the only way that someone gets auto booked on with a setter is through load ticket post purchase. So in an attempt to like protect them from having just a ton of people book in with them that are maybe lower quality and not as optimized into the future uh or into the future, we can optimize around that. Um but in current state it would just be this portion. Okay. Now stats behind this bookings 32 no show one cancel six that's a show rate of 78%. Okay four closed with cash collected in total of 20K AOV 5K. All right so that's insane for us. So this is like fantastic and this is not. Um so let me share what I mean. So down here and to clarify this 32 bookings is how many actual sets occurred. Okay, not how many bookings came into the setter calendar. So I have all the stats on this and I can go into deeper when I do another video on like the current low ticket what we started at as we're optimizing. Um but in current state call it double that have come through. So we would have on this 60 calls that came in with a setter and that booked direct onto a setter calendar. Of those 32 were set onto a closer calendar. Okay. the this show rate is crazy is so good for us. Like we average right now 50 55 and that's broken over time and gone gone down to like 45 but right now call it 50. So the fact that the show rate is this high is great. The close rate is also pretty good um for us right now uh with whatever that is 12% or so. Um so we optimize around 10. Our goal for setters and for these is like 20. So that's what I mean by this needs to get better. Um because what happened to the ones in between? Okay. Now, great stats there. And the why I want to show you that is because the difference between an auto set where they're just constantly coming in or autobooking constantly in and the selfset. Self-s set is where we're going to have people that are dialed from the CRM or found in different buckets. Okay. So, of our self-s stats, we have 30 bookings that have come through, which are sets. Seven of them have no showed, eight have canceled, which is a show rate of 50%. Only two have closed, which is with uh two full pays of 7200. So total cash collected is 14,400 and the AOV is 7200 like I said because it's two units of full pay. Now look at the differences between these and this is very limited and early data. I just want to share like as we go. The whole point of this channel is just me sharing like what we're learning and how we're actively doing it. But this is crazy to us um the difference in the show rate right in the beginning. Now where are these coming from? Okay, current buckets is these two are going to be considered self-s set and these are going to be auto. Okay, now self-s set right here. Someone's going to apply and they are going to get routed based on the financial qualifier. Now, some people will land on this booking page and this one actually kind of is like right here and there's a form on there that says, "Hey, can't find a time that works for you? Fill out this form." Those forms zap into a channel and then the uh setters hit them forever the closers have, but now the setters do. So the setters basically get these like layup leads that are right there that are trying to find a time that doesn't fit on the calendar. So they get those which is a setter hot leads channel. And then the biggest one is this app notebook. So you're going to have people that land in this that for us it's about 50%. So on a given day you'll have 200 applications with a 100 book calls. So 50% drop off. So what happens to the pe the hundred that applied but did not book. Uh we have follow-up sequences. I have other videos where I talk more about this that we have like our automated communications through SMS. that's AI, um, email, but now we're having setters call them. Now, as we've scaled, this number has gotten way bigger than 100. So, call it two or three or whatever, hundred that have not that are app no books in a given day. And like, it just wasn't optimized. So, the first couple days of giving these to setters, we just zapped them into a channel and we said just claim them, call them, and go from there. Now, we have like a routing and priority listing. So for us, the financial qualifier is less than 1K, 1 to 5K, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 plus, I believe. Um, so we have them now coming in with different notifiers. So if they're less than 1K, that's like nothing. It just shows that it came in. The next one has one bell, two bell, three bell, up to four. So they can quick scroll through uh what happens overnight, what happens over the weekend, um, or just when they come in real time, and they can see which ones are the higher priority because they can see the more bells. Okay, so just that has this uptick in claimed because now they know which ones to prioritize and call versus having it so it's just all of them in there. Um so that's that bucket right there and then this low ticket direct booking. So this is like crushing for us. Um like absolutely crushing for us right now. Um the biggest thing here is going to be volume more than anything and then optimizing around what happens in these different uh what happens with the calls themselves and outcomes. So, as of now, we're not really tracking this. And like none of this is optimized. I'm literally just sharing just raw stats of what has happened in the first like x amount of days. And obviously, like extremely low uh in terms of volume on this, like six units is really not that much. So, I throw this as like the title just cuz you know, clickbait. Love it. Um but for us is very low volume. Um now, future buckets going into this. That's why I put some of these red ones. Um and then things not included. So, cancels, no shows right now. Actually, let me back up a second. So the current buckets are not optimized. So I have a huge issue with us adding more to the plate in terms of team focus like just overall optimization until it's actually like they're fully optimizing the app notebooks. They're fully optimized on the setter hot leads. They're fully optimized on um taking the call. So like these right now are not at capacity. We can take 60ish a day which for us would be like 100 low ticket. Right now we're selling 40 low ticket. So it's 25 30 of these a day. Um, so once we double volume, we're going to need to grow team on this side, which is good. Um, because the stats on this are solid. Um, once they come in, they land in this call scheduled. So, we don't know how many of them landed no show cancel. Like, we do, but we just don't have trackers on it or enough data is probably a better way to say it, uh, on these yet. But what can we change in this frame to make it so more of these uh, go from call scheduled to closed one set, right? This is the number one optimization. So, it's like if we can get 50, 70, whatever. like I don't even have numbers for you yet on terms of how many of those should set and then go up to a calendar here and then this is the next optimization point. So of that how many of the sets actually turn into closed one versus no showing and cancelling and this kind of like this like perpetual loop because what the next bucket we want to put setters on is having them on no shows and cancels. So, for the marketing direct bookings, how uh do we reclaim those no-shows and cancels assuming 50% no-show and cancel, which is crazy, but true. Like, how do they get how do they recapture those? And what percentage of them can be recaptured? And then from their own sets, how do they make sure that their sets do not know, show, and cancel? How do they nurture them leading up to? Because if we can get show rates on sets to 80% call it um which would be cra like amazing for us 7580 and then those also then close out at the same rate so call it a live uh a 20% live call close rate that would be fantastic. So future bucket I just talked about cancel no-shows um Mandy SMS help this is the app notebook automated AI is our Mandy. So having them in there because it'll flag when people want like to talk to a human basically or like when they say stuff that would be that the AI doesn't know how to handle it flags those channels. So taking over that channel um these guys really want an inbound ring group. So a phone number dedicated that's on marketing assets that's sent out in emails and then taking over comment guard and putting in there right our our market's 40 to 60 years old. So, putting in, "Oh, yeah, just give us a call in a comment." And then having that ring group uh set up for setters would likely be a nice lift of two, five, 10 a day of sets for us, which would be very nice. Um, and then sales hot leads. This one I'm really back and forth on. I need like a full dedicated video to this one, but sales hot leads is the sales version of the setter hot leads, which it so basically it's them passing off. Right now we do a 30-minute sales slots or sales call slots and a lot of the time the calls will go over like almost all of the closed deals are 40ish minutes and we have not done a good job of like optimizing around making sure that all the calls can go the right length that uh no shows and cancels are put in the right buckets and that they're free when they need to be because if they have backtoback it's like you know they have an hour off where they have no shows and cancels. So having some way that if they take a call and they're basically double booked or they need to pass it off because they're they're running late on a call because they're getting a close that they can transfer those to setters. Right now they transfer them to each other as sales hot leads amongst the closers. Um but the dream state is to do it through setters. So that's the next bucket on there. So, all in all, um I'm going to come up with some more videos to share about like what the math is on this because this is cranking right now and we're getting uh of these deals, right? Four of them have come from low ticket within the first like 5 days, which is great. Um and then these two have come from the basically mining the CRM. This number I want to be like crazy high uh in terms of actual close because this is the this is the real like what else are we squeezing out of the VSSL funnel because we know the stats across the board on this thing just as marketing just with closers like down to the T down to a T. Um but how much can we squeeze if we have setters at every layer of this optimized and parts of this of the VSSL funnel? Um it's we're looking at as like two dedicated teams. You have like your self set and then you have your auto set. self set will take over multiple of these and the auto set will just run these. Right? So other ways that we can add to the auto set um is if we wanted we could put on this DQ booking page. Right now it's closers on both these. It's higher quality closers and lower quality closers. What we could do is make it so the DQ page it goes to setters instead of closers. That's an option. We could make it so the automations that happen here, pushing them back uh both in email as well as text can push to a page that's for setter bookings instead. So basically, you would just make it so the main booking page, the marketing funnel, it gets the top quality people only through here and everyone else is forced through a setter before they can book a sales call. So that's an option um and kind of where we're at. But right now, I just want to optimize around them. These are solid stats for the beginning. Um, but like we need to do 10 times this for this to be like super worth it. And again, first 5 days not optimized, not anything. Um, so yeah. So excited to see where it goes. Um, I'm going to make another video here soon on the low ticket stats, where we're at uh so far, the ascension rate, the uh layers between this percentages, and kind of where we're at with that AOV. So let me know if you guys have any comments or questions about these other videos you want me to shoot and then Instagram for communication as always. So, talk soon and have a good

# We made $1,6M last month selling Coaching | E20
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTt-D-A_uOA

in today's video I'm going to go through a March 2025 in review for our main info and coaching business I'm going to go through our year-over-year cash collected numbers for the month of March what went right this month what did not go right um some funnel metrics and math and then into our April 2025 plan for the company as well as some personal all right so last year we did 30 million in cash collected I make everything on this channel just to share what did work what did not work as you're about to see what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all right I do all to find top talent opportunities and build a solid network of people doing the same so let's get into it all right so this is all just no fluff actual numbers so for March of oops for March of 2022 we did about 600k in 2023 we did about 750 last year we did 2.7 and this year just last month it's 7: a.m. on the 1 so this is literally as of yesterday uh about 1.6 so not good right that's like trending about half of what we trended last year so let's get into what went right what went wrong and then I'll explain kind of our thinking behind this so what went right uh we had a new CMO come in on the tail end of the month same with an outbound director so we've never had a CMO in the company we've always done it ourselves so the other co-founder um is has been leading marketing and sales this entire time um or marketing mainly sales we've had a sales director come in about a year ago but um chief of marketing absolute sicko in the marketing space or in the info space um so this is extremely exciting so none of this is really reflective of any of these new people um and more or less it's like us running it off cliff uh waiting until we had somebody to run it properly because our acquisition has gone crazy and I'll show you that uh outbound director we've had we tested Setters like a year and a half ago had somebody on the team that was never quit their other job and was running ours and their so ours wasn't effective and then found out that they were still working their other jobs so we just got rid of it and then just never Revisited which is silly of us to do um but now we officially have an outbound director that came on and joined the team also ton of experience in the space like our CMO has sold over 100,000 low tickets on a single low ticket and the outbound director has done up to like 3 million or so in a month in cash collected through setting team so two very experienced individuals everyone else in the company has more or less grown into their role at least on not on the coaching side the coaching side they come in certified and all and like have all of that um but a lot of the time the people we're hiring that are in management or kind of like in office if you want to call it um are learning and getting the experience on the job and like me as a great example it's like these are my highest months it's not like I've done that some else come in with the Playbook and put it in place um so it's pretty cool to finally have experienced hires who have done the role can or and can bring the playbook in so Load Ticket we officially launched Load Ticket on the tail end of this month I'll show some stats and math around that um a firm for the longest time we running with different pay plans and different breakdowns of this we locked in our firm to perfectly match the term of uh the actual product um so this is actually going to be a huge lift because it's going to feed Facebook back with the right people because we have people doing like way lower monthly options but like misaligning with terms and it was just kind of messy so we clean this up uh reviews with coaches I just sent out a message about this in our team chat but we just passed over 300 on trust pilot like 200 and something I believe it's 200 something on uh Better Business Bureau which is big for our market Facebook Google all the things um so we went from like 110 or 15 to having over 300 just from doing a coaching push so basically doing like an incentivized program for the coaches uh I have another video on the channel where I talk about getting review and growth there but this is huge for us big flywheel a lot of people look up reviews before they get on a sales call or before they purchase and it's best to just have as many as possible um sales team onboarding I'll go into that and kind of like what went wrong and breakdown but we've been having issues with sales team uh performance and that's also a marketing issue right those are always kind of like in tandem um but we just have some issues there right like no direct income goals uh incentivizing or kind of like conversations around like I said income goals metrics they need to hit so if you're goal is 10K a month how many calls do you need to do how many do you need to close what's your average close what's your followup like just that wasn't clean for a lot of the team and that's just a longterm thing that's happened um management is you know getting more onetoone with them we've had pods and having to take away the pods so they could have better on toone connection but all of that I'll get more into that later Q2 planning I did a video on this on what our plan was and how we went through it and the actual structure of it and it went fantastic so again these two guys the first time that they were on this because we've we've done this in the past we do annual planning we do things and they're kind of loftier or I don't know if lofty is the right word but they're kind of more vague and lofty I guess and uh this was a real actionable like proper quarter League goals per person that align with departments that break out to the company overall goals um and this went really really well and again these two this is the first time they were in this meeting because they just joined the company um and then also the uh retention team is another piece in here so we never had a dedicated team we've always just aligned it with the coaches and basically just given them commission percentages on the people that they retain good and bad because they just kind of want to coach they don't want to also sell so we rolled out a retention team that was the Pod leaders that we took from sales that wanted to do retention so though how they can keep them um so there's more to come with this but just the initial launch of this is a win um we're going to do things with like continuity down cells almost that to keep people after their first year stuff like that sblo another video on here but we doubled our response rates on our app notebook sequence all by just sending blue bubbles instead of green um so is a pretty cool thing we got to figure out how to roll this out in other places SEO another just kind of like thing that got done uh we finally hired an SEO company because we got the site redone in January um and yeah so they have boosted a ton of things and grow in that way fixing a ton of technical errors that came in because we built for design not for SEO and we're going back to that and then triage we changed out some stuff this for us is our call confirmation team so that basically is just like dialing people as soon as they book and making sure you're confirming the call they have the highest percentages they've ever had on terms of claimed calls and now into what went wrong in the real of this so like I said here that's not good right so all these things are good all these things are good into the future and but in terms of like cash collected not good at all on the month and mainly what went wrong or just kind of overall show rates drop to sub 50% for the first time in like a long time so a lot of things changed a lot we changed the entire sequence around it we changed a bunch of stuff in marketing which is likely a big cause of it um we changed how the confirmation team was reaching out we like we basically threw a ton of stuff at it which is not the answer necessarily but we did and they have dipped they have kind of come back a bit and we're still trying to solve for this but show rates dipped so if we di 10% on a th calls then a 100 of those didn't show and if you have a 20% close like you just missed out on 20 units right quick math and that was across the entire month which is like not cool um so we broke automations we changed things we like it was just a mess um sales per booking this is going to be a market this is going to be marketing this going to be show rates there going to be close rates right um it was terrible it the lowest month we've had in like a year and a half so calendars were 75% booked I have some data over here so don't mind me but yeah calendars were like 75% book and we had the lowest rate since December of 23 I want to say yeah December of 23 on the lowest sales for booking which is like crazy so we use this metric a lot and it's just overall bookings to overall sales and there's a lot of other ones like show rate live rate um live of qualified like all these different ones and the sales team is doing like okay so it's it's really like a mix between marketing and sales that happen an issue and then due to that CPA went wild so we have new CMO coming in changing things on that we're testing low ticket we're doing Setters we're doing all these different things to affect CPA but this last month like just if you look at the month as is not on what we're going to do just on what happened it was bad like bad bad so we broke even lost money within that month due to that okay so going into the actual funnel metrics of math I have uh I have different videos where I go through the actual funnel but quick gist of it you have paid traffic we do have organic the organic is mainly going to come in through the application because that's what the CTA is on site and on a lot of the organic um but for paid we're going to run traffic to an opt-in page that's first name email to a vssl funnel and then we're also now running paid direct to a low ticket okay so for this I'm going to go through the metrics and the math around here but for optins we had 30,000 leads come in so first name email and then they watch the vssl tons of email followup tons of uh things in there then they land on an application page once they land on the application page um technically this router's over here but what I mean by this is from the application we have a routing setup that's really actually just two-ways so it's basically they say that they have less than 1K they've ever invested in their health and fitness it will send them down to this router if they have anything above that it'll send them up to the main booking page with the main closers so we had three uh 3,500 qualified apps meaning above the 1K and we had 3,345 that were DED so I'll get into where they route on here but of the ones that booked or of the ones I'm sorry that applied that were uh higher quality 1,800 of them booked a call that were qu that were uh designated as qualified bookings and these are going to go to the top closers and these are people who have spent 20K in their health and fitness 5K like these bigger numbers um so 1,800 of those calls 3,345 hit our router and what I mean by this is depending on how much availability we have on the next day because our main goals for the sales at least is to keep the sales team full so of those 3,345 that hit less than 1K depending on the day uh are either going to to go to a DQ booking that's not going to fire the pixel and it's going to go to lower quality SL onboarding reps um if there's availability it'll go to those if there is not or the availab uh or there's lesser availability it's going to just knock them straight to a DQ uh low ticket page so they're not going to be able to book They're not going to be able to go through anything and then it's going to push them over here to the low ticket right same low ticket that we're running um direct paid traffic to so of those 3345 I don't have the exact numbers real quick um off how many landed on the DQ page versus the bridge page I could find it but it's just not really super relevant for this um and 1,53 made it through on the booking of the DQ okay so on right there we've got about what 2,800 calls yeah it's 2900 calls that happened over the month all right now low ticket they are coming in through paid and they're also coming in as this DQ Bridge okay now the actual paid properly started halfway to like last third of the month so these numbers are just kind of it's more so about the percentages than the total volume um because we were not actively running this and it was coming through low ticket which had different conversion percentages so for the low ticket checkout so of this we had um a thousand of them that opted in it's a two-step loow ticket so it's first name email and then going into uh phone 561 of them purchased so you've got whatever that is around 55% call it of a conversion rate of the checkout page so we had 561 that purchased and then of that we have 73 that booked a call with a Setter now those 73 came from like the last 150 of these purchases because this didn't even exist until less than a week ago right so the play here is uh low ticket direct as well as DQ full and pushing them through to check out then purchase then they're in the community they're in the product they're doing that and then uh pushing them to book a call with a Setter okay and now we only have two dedicated sets who do this we just added the second one four days ago we added the first one so these are flying in and then the percentage that I can give math once this actually like flashes out but so far these have insane uh show rates then Set Set uh set rates and then live call with closer show rates and then backed out close rate we already have like three units I think that have come from this and then from the main funnel where they pick up people on Setters uh we have another two I think units so far so like in a week we've closed like four or five units um and yeah so now now backing out to the actual terms and purchases 188 terrible so bad like when we were cranking it was like double that and not good so again that's that sales for booking number because based on all this amount of calls we've only had this now our no show or I'm sorry our show rates between cancels and no shows we had it was bad and that then directly affects how many live calls they are so how many they close Okay so that's a marketing and sales thing we're messing with marketing throughout the entire month optimizing for different events and trying to play with things now we have a new Mo in uh great media buyers guys who have done it run the Playbook so they're running low ticket and rebuilding the entire thing we're essentially like groundup building this so ground up with 110 employees while existing but like yeah it's a struggle it's a real struggle um so 188 was the new units Target is 400 plus okay now going into April 2025 the plan on this low ticket expansion so as of now we sell one thing on the low ticket so it's one aov one fix and is $37 I believe right now um and so expansion on that so low ticket overall this is technically in a three-way split so just off the Baseline we're trying to set or we're trying to set a baseline of what the frontend sales uh page conversion is what the checkout page conversion is the booking what percentage of those go down the funnel to then purchase book a call with the setter fill out the app uh then how many make it to a closer then how many close from that show rates like I need that full picture of math before we lean into any uh particular bucket but one the things we do is just slowly increase things from the front to back so our our uh um CMO talks about this like front to back front to back like we're solving for that as we go and then I'm just trying to get data base lines as we go across expansion around that is right now we don't want to optimize for aov through otos but we can through an order bump we can through these other ways so even just doing that we can offset because right now call it I don't want to give wrong numbers but like call it 60% maybe that we're doing liquidation right now on the front so call $30 net CPA back that in the whole goal being can we get people on the phone with the closer for $100 that close at higher than standard rates and then all of a sudden be at a 1ou a sub 10,000 CPA which is like a third of where we're at right now based on all this terrible math coming through the vssl bloated spend just bad right so loads to get expansion Setters same thing here optimizing around these flows right now they are hitting the app no book so people who fall off between um these so the 3500 and 1800 main focus on these non the D not the DQ ones so of those whatever I can't do that math real quick but whatever 1500 is I don't know uh of the 1500 is 1700 is uh they then hit those up and call them right now we have an AI bot that does that but that's inclusive of already what's in here so they're already doing the recapture and only getting to this percentage um so having a call team that does that is where they're at here and then also on these low tickets but we have cancel no shows we have uh custom booking uh request forms we have we just have like 19 different places they can hit up people so the goal here is to scale this team to call it probably 10 throughout the month right now we're at like three or four um optin we are doing uh new page Dev stuff CMO is you know there sees a huge lift on what we're doing with the optin page We've ran basically the same optin page for like four or five years and we've never properly tested it or had proper testing methods and that's both on me from tracking and marketing and not launching anything new and it just has been what it's been um so new OP are being built overall Facebook and Google for both low ticket and um and the vssl main funnel so like I said we're like from the ground up rebuilding this thing like heavily um so trying to keep everything baselined with metrics and not like launch new because we don't want to do that necessarily yet um but figuring out these numbers and then also properly launching them all on Google we have a really good Google media buyer that just came on sales team we are onboarding and ramping new and doing it in a way that is kind of a different approach right right it's a little bit more like um I don't say aggressive but like harder and more financially motivated very focused around you know if you want to make 20K a month which has been done in our company we had sales reps who made 350 400 whatever before I mean last year we had someone who did I think 320 and in the past we've had someone who made 400 uh in years prior so like the opportunity is there um so what are the math what's the math behind that if you want to make 20K a month how many calls you need 80 availabilities of those 80 50 you're going to show of those how many you close and like doing that in a way that where there's the boards for compensation or for uh motiv not motivation um you know what I mean so where there's boards to incentivize them properly and give them Clarity around numbers and competitions and all that so we're doing a new sales Round of hiring how that may change is depending on how we do DQ so if we full DQ which is what we're talking about doing where it just goes all into low ticket then you would be in a position where the actual quality bookings that hit the calendar or the actual just overall count would be like 40% less right if this is around 40% the bookings um but then you have an uplift now that would come from the Setters so you have Setters and uh the Quality Engine here that would increase that and then you also now have Setters that would come from low ticket or set calls that would come from low ticket so it likely would even out and just have higher quality on the uh calendar haven't fully decided that yet but very likely what will happen um and then we have to back into how many sales reps we need for that and then at scale retention team I talked about this that we rolled it out but we haven't fully rolled out tracking and like funnel steps um because I want to set up like full pipeline so when someone is 60 days out from retention they get a you know reach out to them basically what happens on the reach out did they want to schedule a call did they call schedule then no show cancel did they not want to talk on the phone like what are the outcomes of that and where is the current situation of the team because these these guys are sales reps and they have been and but they just have like like a ton of empathy and they love the product and they're into it so them in retention is amazing it's just how do we get the right people to be doing that actual job and how do I give them the system around it to do it and then what's the offer they can pitch which is huge because right now they're just pitching staying for another year which is like 1K less Department level kpi is on me so tracking um dashboarding uh agenda in all the different departments we have this at some level but they kind of all run on their own already and I just want to clean it up so it's all in one way and then brand faces we have multiple brand faces that we've launched but we just need to like roll them out more uh aggressively and just continue to scale into them and get better stats around it because we have not been backing out on units very well which is like obviously the key here it's been very difficult to see what brand faces work or don't in terms of like actual dollars per ad or whatever you want to call it versus cost per call cost per whatever which is already good on these new brand faces so that would say would work but yeah so all of this is just to say a lot of the marketing Ops this is like the part that I know and I'm you know functioning on there is 15 other things that are happening in fulfillment and sales and uh organic and all these other parts of the company where they are crushing it as well as having obviously some shortcomings too um but yeah that is not a this is not meant to be a reflection of them not doing anything it's just meant to be me talking about the parts I know and can accurately give uh insights on um but yeah the rest of the company is just crushing it we just need to help and fix acquisition so that the rest of company can Thrive with inflow of new um new clients so personal just a fun one if you don't care about this you can pop now 19 videos on YouTube 185 YouTube subs woohooo 30 DMS from that which is like this is kind of the goal right is like build a network around these of other high quality people so I've had a ton of people DM 30 something let's call it um I think it's even higher than that now but talking about their businesses sharing their numbers guys who are doing 1.5 guys who are doing 300K a month like all these different stuff which I love because then I get to see different funnels I get to talk about it I have some perspective but this whole thing is like no ego our way clearly is breaking even and not making money this month so like listen to who you want to but um that finished one inone oneon-one person one toone inperson coaching I've never had an inperson coach before and I did this year for like last six months maybe and very odd um for me because I do everything digital so going in person I finished that up finally it was like six months um and this was like a business SL like life coach you call it uh oneone personal training I'm a huge believer in we do what we do others do right energy is energy out so I want to pay for personal training pay like 10 GS for personal training because that's what people pay us I did it it was good but again in person not my jam fixed schedule on someone else's calendar like just not really my jam so did it all good fuel this is just funny one just meal planning all these other things that just come direct to the door so I literally don't have to leave this desk terrible planning March I did a terrible job of setting the calendar and intention and like what I'm going to do if it makes the calendar gets done and like I didn't even put things on the calendar so I need to fix that and then Puerto Rico stuff I can make a whole video on this but I lived in Puerto Rico for the last 3 years and had you know 4% tax and did that whole jam and and ended up moving out of there but like I'm closing everything out and finalizing it so this is kind of just my reminder to that March I 99% of the way closed it out and uh for like the tax year and stuff like that and plan into April Daily Post going to continue on with these videos of Daily Post I don't have outcome goals because I don't know the trajectory of this I don't know if it's consistent like linear or if it's more exponential I don't know the answer to that but like the input is a Daily Post New Biz coach I have this sicko guy that is um really well known the space and like lead gen and affiliate specific that I have worked with in the past when I was in a worst place in life maybe where I couldn't actually like effectively execute on what he we would talk about uh but now I feel like I'm in a good place so I am starting up with him completely remote new gym pick up heavy and that's kind of fun for me because I can go whenever I want and like this the only things I do I work I work out I eat and I hang out with my friends family girlfriend like that's about it like so new gem is

# we spent $15M on Facebook. this is our Pixel Strategy. | E19
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI4L1IdSkLw

in today's video I'm going to share how we have our pixel set up for our high tick vssl call funnel as well as our low ticket Ascension funnel how these two connect the different events we are firing at each phase of the funnel and then if you stick around to the end I'm going to share how we fire browser and server events for purchases that happen over Zoom or call because it's a huge issue in tracking all right so last year we did 30 million in cash collected in 2024 and I make all these videos on the channel just to share what did work what did not work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all with the goal of finding top talent opportunities and building a solid network of people doing the same all right so let's get into it so first things first as I just kind of like a little explainer this is mainly going to be me talking for meta it does work for Google in the same way or very similar way but just for ease of conversation we'll just say meta so what we're going to want to do is you're going to have browser events and server events and you'll hear this kind of all over the place but browser is essentially just when you have the pixel installed on site and it's when a user goes to something on site it fires back to Facebook so it's capturing the information can about a person uh from them being onsite server is what you're collecting and then passing back through the conversion API okay so different tools like we have hyos installed we're not currently using it to send to the pixel and we have a custom setup uh currently installed that I'm going to go through it here but uh hyros essentially does the server side and then just having the pixel on your site does the browser and the main goal is is to get these to match so if you look at like your leads for example and you look in the back office of events manager your main goal is to have those two lines aligned so browser and server are the same and then then you're D duplicating so you're not uh firing it as twice but you're just showing that they're matched so the same person who's on site is what you're sending server and it aligns because in Facebook's like okay cool the person actually was there and they're sending us more information from server so to go through the funnel opt-in page currently they come in give us name and email and then they land on one of these two oops vsl pages okay on this we are going to fire the lead event everything we're going to try and optimize for and there's guys who have really good videos about this Jeremy Haynes has really good videos about pixel training and this just our uh setup of this but he goes very in- depth into how you want to use default conversion events because then you can basically use all the other people that use Facebook for those default conversion events and it'll find from that pocket versus if you use a custom conversion you're basically just using only your data and only your portion when this allows basically better training on the entire Facebook algorithm so for us we're going to fire a lead and then someone's going to land on this application page now when somebody applies they're going to get routed based on a financial qualifier in ours so there's a lot of different ways you can do this on lead scoring and this is very common practice now but for us we essentially have if it's less than 1K 1 to 5K 5 to 10 10 to 20 and 20 plus I believe um and on those excuse me for us we just use the less than 1K as a DQ okay and then anything above that comes through so for the bookings when they land on the booking page that is going to be a native event of a submit application okay because when they finish the application they land on the booking page now down here what we'll do is depending on how much availability we have if we need more bookings we actually allow them to book so there's actually like a little toggle here that routes them but if we need more bookings on day into the next day we'll allow them to book through a DQ which goes to a different round robin and kley that'll have just less quality um like not as experienced reps so either people ramping or those who are kind of like down in the bucket uh that just don't have as high as sale per booking so we'll still allow the bookings to come through but we will not pass the information to the pixel okay so that's the key here on the pixel training the I'll go into this in a second once they land on here they will book a call and that will fire a schedule event okay so all we're firing on the main vssl is going to be a lead a submit app and a schedule okay we'll get into purchases over here now why is important is because on page we have this installed so it's firing the lead the submit app and the schedule and on the back end on the conversion API we are firing as much information as we has on as as we have on that person back as a server event too so you're getting a browser and a server for lead for a submit app and a schedule okay now DQ nothing happens nothing I mean like the the pixels installed but there's no events that actually occur so to Fire and then when we are full calendars pack we actually pass them over to the low ticket so I have over here we have two different pixels you're going to have the main pixel and the low ticket pixel so the main pixel is this blue that's firing all these uh places here low ticket both of these places right here are inflows this optin page for the for the vssl for the free training and and then these actually technically all as one and then we're just running a three-way split right now I just want to show you so this will get um this actually has the green but this gets traffic direct to it and it also gets it through this vsl funnel so once these come in they're going to land on a frontend sales page for the low ticket and it's basically a two-step so to in order to check out they have to put in their name and email and they go to a secondary page and that for us fires a lead event we also have an initiate checkout I don't know if it's going to fit in this box it's not but you know what I mean int checkout we'll do that so uh lead is going to fire when they get to the second page initiate checkout is going to fire when they start doing it so JavaScript on uh on page it's when they're actually starting to fill out the form it'll fire initiate checkout they'll then land on the uh success page which is a purchase so all you're getting is a lead then when someone's filling it out initiate checkout and then a purchase on these now these we then have a booking widget okay so in current form we have nothing here but these bookings are going to go in and book with a Setter all right so these are not the same quality type of bookings uh as somebody who is booking up here direct after being qualified and through this so we do a layer of talking to a Setter as like essentially a triage and Lead filtering so for this we currently don't have anything but we're talking about putting a custom conversion in here that's going to be like a custom schedule so not the main schedule cuz we don't want to pollute it with that but we're in talks right now we have nothing they land on this and then they fill out an application that just gives us more context for the setter okay so to zoom out of here you have two different pixels you have the green down here which is going to be the low ticket and then you have the blue up here which is going to be the vssl main all right and the same thing works as you have as we're rolling out more and more so when we're going to have another secondary vssl another secondary low ticket that's in a different um Niche or more so like an angle so let's say like menopause versus macronutrient we would have a completely different pixel setup for a completely different low ticket right so we're not going to plute them with the same so you're going to have one pixel for low ticket menopause one uh for vssl menopause you're going to have one for macronutrient Load Ticket you're going to have and you're going to have all these different pixels for each one to keep them dedicated and trained okay and generally speaking it's the same thing with the ad account that's going to be running through that is so you're going to have the different ad account with a different pixel with a different funnel okay and dedicated same thing with Google we have a complete dupe of this for Google so that we don't um blend the traffic up here we still have one main and like supposedly that's not how you're supposed to do it so we're working on fixing that and as we roll out this load ticket working on fixing that but that's how we fire these through directly okay so the next question is what happens after this so they either talk to a Setter talk to a closer everything else is happening in HubSpot so we've collected all this information we're storing it in HubSpot for the server side as well as we do have hyros on hyros is kind of like a quick easy fix to the server side it just doesn't get as much information necessarily but because it stores the fingerprints and like the m multiple uh attribution sources it's all baked into a profile in hyros and then you're able to just send that on stripe purchase or on whatever to make it as a purchase we're trying something different that we've been trying for about six months that's all custom that's storing everything in HubSpot custom and then the browser stuff is all happening just the same way basically now this part it's kind of the fun part so for this when someone buys they're buying over the phone or over Zoom right so we're on right now I give you the credit card information you purchase and why that's not great is because the the customer never actually did anything on page to check out so different than like physical Ecom where someone's checking out it can easily fire pixel and server because the person's on page doing it for the browser server side is just everything that was collected send that and they're both matching cool but for call funnels and high ticket stuff like this or basically where you're just taking it it's it's considered an offline conversion and there's no easy way out of the box hos does it but again it has to like collect all that fingerprint information the amounts so if you're doing custom pay plans someone pays 2 then 5K it counts as two purchases you got to merge them and then send it like it just gets a little Messier as you start to scale unless you're just selling one standardized Thing One Price over the phone all in hyros easy simple but as you get to kind of a little more custom it it it breaks a little bit so what we have here is we're going to fire a purchase to the low ticket or a purchase to the so either this pixel or this pixel dependent on the source they came to start right so if they came through the low ticket then they ended up talking to a Setter getting on a closer calendar and purchased that purchase we have tracked inside HubSpot that's going to know if they Source if their initial Source was through the vssl funnel or through here now you're going to have people did that did both like a lot of the time and but if they did low ticket you're going to want to attribute it to the low ticket because that's where they came from right the whole idea here is you're training the pixel on their actual source and we were trying to keep this as clean as possible and this is kind of like an everchanging thing so I will be able to update this into the future but we're going to Route them for thing so you're going to pick and for us instead of firing it on like a checkout page like you could on low ticket like on these for example this is super easy to do server and browser we're going to fire it on oops we're going to fire it on our terms page this is a cool workaround that we figured out so sales rep checks out the person over the phone they fill out their information in the order form or their buy link or their whatever sends them a dedicated terms link that has tracking in it that will autofill some of the information basically like in a hidden form inside a jot form for us and then on submission that'll fire the browser and the server event okay so instead of it just firing the server event very easily from the buy link cool but there was never any browser event and Facebook loves browser events because they can see the person's actually taking the action so by just sending them a dedicated terms link we can capture the browser and the server and then route back get the deal amount that's a total amount that they assigned in HubSpot can get all the hidden uh uh I guess well hidden Fields but um deeper data that's everything from like the IP address the first Source the click the the Facebook ID like all those different pieces are stored in HubSpot and can be sent together so this is how we're looking at it um we changed this about six months ago we have about the same results there's a ton of people who have done this who have crazy better results but our issue is more so around how we've been running marketing and sales at that time um but this setup itself is like matching it works so right now we're duping this entire thing out and super and S soon we will be for Google as well um but this whole thing is going to be tested out in Google and duped um something we did he on this is that like you can't send purchases back to both for example so like if someone bought uh paid 7200 you can't fire that purchase on server side back to both of these I guess that's like against terms some people do it and say they have good results we don't we just pick one and we go back and forth depending um but yeah I hope this kind of gives a a brief intro into this uh I really want to go into another video on these about like costs and percentages through and how much routing and like these what percentage they close at versus these um but yeah this all work in progress all these videos are me just sharing what we're actively doing not necessarily what is 100% the right way we don't know we're just trying to like I said up here we're just trying to show what did work what didn't work and what we are actively doing um so yeah so subscribe on to here if you want to see more of these comment let me know what you want more info on and then Instagram always for DMS and communication and all that so let me know if you have any questions and I will talk with you all soon

# We have 100 Employees. here's how we pay them. | E18
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swBKfKcnjmw

In today's video, I'm going to go through how we compensate our team of over 100 employees all the way from the sea level down to the boots on the ground doing the role. All right, so last year we did 30 million in cash collected in 2024. And all this entire channel is just me sharing what did work, what did not work, and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year. All right, and I do this so I can attract top talent, opportunities, and build a network. So let's get into it. So first thing, uh, all these purple boxes right here are essentially people who are KPI performance driven. Okay, so everyone's going to have a base of what KPIs they need to be doing like are they doing a good job but the purple ones are where it is connected to their comp. Okay, and even when building this I was like I need to do this in more places and I'll go into that. Um but just starting over here in marketing division. So we have our CMO who is a new role for us. Um so far we've actually always run that internal to us. So CEO uh and co-founder was always running marketing. Um, but for almost all of these and this one included, it's going to be a base that's like a pretty healthy base and then directly KPI to for us it's the net CPA of our main product. So like our main backend offering. So I have other videos about this, but um, basically we're now testing low ticket and ascension models. So there's going to be blended CPAs and all that. And what we really really care about is what is the net CPA of that back-end product. So call it um 3,2500 2,000 and 1500 CPA. And at those different levels, they get a higher percentage as a bonus. So, say they make 100 grand a year. And I don't want to use exact numbers because that's not really fair to these people to do. Um, but I'm more than happy to kind of go into exacts of the actual model, but not the actual numbers. So, let's say it's 100K as a salary. Then when they hit the first threshold, they'll get 20% as a bonus. And we do that out in a monthly basis. So, we do that across all these for our KPI driven uh for the bonuses or for the uh additional compensation. So, let's say it's 10K a month. So they're going to get that no matter what. Then we're going to say 20% additional will come if they hit this threshold. They'll get 40% additional. They'll get 60% additional 80 all the way up until they can make almost like double their salary. Um and for us this model works out well because the company is then still uh making more money per unit. And really structuring these like the biggest thing here is structuring it so that the bonuses are truly bonuses. So the company is making more no matter what. And it's like a win-win situation. The person makes more and we make more as a company. Never in a situation where the KPI could drive it. So, we actually make less profit. All right. Um, graphic designer. This is like a per unit basis. So, oops, I didn't even throw a little arrow in here. Um, so this one is going to be for uh like a perunit base. This is a base that actually climbs. So, it's really variable on how much you spend. It's not fixed for this uh specific one. We've had media buyers in the past or agencies more so that were like 10 to 13% of actual spend. So, like we've paid a million in ads in a month and paid out like 130k in agency fees and now we're completely internal. But like these can get wonky if they're tied to ad spend and they really should be uh CPA driven because in that example our CPA got whack and it didn't even uh we were losing money and paying out more which is not cool. So Google media buyer is a fixed fee that does climb as we go. um not too aggressively, but just knowing that like when we spend let's say 50% of our spend, this will increase from call it 4K or 8K to 10K. Like it's a 20 to 30% lift. Um this is a twoerson team. Um and theirs has climbed too as the spend has climbed because right now we're spending like 30-ishk a day. Um copywriter, this is an OG for our company and has been there when we were just doing like random needed one-off stuff to now he writes two a day emails, all of our copy, all of our stuff. This is again just a flat one that has climbed over time and kind of stays. So all these ones that are just like this are essentially like projectbased work and normal salaried roles that will climb with continued uh proper stuff. So they all do have KPIs. It's just their comp isn't directly tied to it. So like this one for example, creative director fully leads all of our organic and it does make sense to figure out a way to tie them to that. we just haven't yet and like that's on me and that is something we've identified and like me making this chart even is extremely helpful to me to be like yeah this one definitely can be this one kind of can be these definitely can be um so stuff like that where there's huge opportunity and none of this is me saying this is the right way to do it this is just how we currently have it set up and have um so over to here CTO COO I don't know this is me I don't know you want to call it but I hate titles I really hate titles so I don't even know why we have all these but people like them so um mine here is variable directed on profit as owner equity, right? Um same with the CEO up here, senior tech lead. This is an interesting one and I need to figure out a good way because this is like my department um in some way, shape or form. right now it's a healthy salary and then when there's like cool big projects that we can directly identify that made a lift whether that's in efficiency and so savings or a lift in things like uh more revenue like the app not book sequence um increase more bookings that we have given random bonuses and one-offs which I believe is very helpful but it's like inconsistent and I don't like that I don't think it's fair for the person fully um but there's a rockstar on our team and it's continuing to take more role and as that role climbs I think that this needs to be in a pocket of a way to earn like a profit share pool. So, we'll see how this evolves over time. This flat fee, that's monthly. All right. Now, into sales. So, currently our closer manager is really our sales director, but only manages the closer. So, this is kind of like a little future state of a model, but this is the same person. And then this is a brand new person for us, set of manager, and I'm kind of like leading at some level right now just because a lot of it's technical and operational to get it all off the ground. And then from there, they're a super strong leader, so they'll be able to run their whole own thing. Um that's why the arrows are here. So these two are both going to be flat and this is what market is right now of March of 2025. So market is a healthy base again. So call it 8 to 12k depending on your person who knows. Um and then heavily on performance. So performance for this being their department new revenue. So like a setter manager would make a percentage of revenue on the new revenue generated which for us is we consider in the first 30 days of so call it 1% 2% like people do different numbers but it could be 1% of uh all new revenue generated. So if there's a million dollars that's collected then they'll get a 10k a million across the month in cash collected that's new that comes from setters they would get 10k right? So you have to bake this in your whole overall models but this seems to be pretty on par. A big thing to think about and something that we ran into is when we get too big or not too big, but like as you scale, some of these can get like crazy uh crazy high. And I've heard people talk about this before and other big owners when we're at like masterminds and stuff that talk about how their C level doesn't really get above like the 3400 range. Um which is interesting. So we have our team got paid really well last year when we did um 30 million like really well. So some of this has tweaked a little but a majority has stayed in place just because these are the team that we had. So that's their setup. Setters. Same thing. It's going to be a low base. Um, this one, these for us are W2. These are 1099 just because they're completely different roles and they have different churn and they have different responsibilities. So, you're allowed to segment those out. Um, but for us, this is a low base and then a percentage of set. So, we have these split out into two. So, we have auto set versus self-s set. So, auto set is something that we're going to direct book with them through marketing. So, after someone buys low ticket, they autobook into a call for an implementation call. That's an auto booking. And we can do 30 of those a day right now while testing or 15 to 20 of those a day is more accurate. But um those are a lower percentage than the higher percentage which is if they mine the CRM, they make a 100 dials, they get someone on the calendar with a closer and then they close. That's more effort, more work. Uh and for us, that's how we're currently structuring it. I'll see if this sticks. We might just go to one flat fee that's kind of blended, but uh in current state, that's how it is. And then closers, I made a whole another video on this on how we pay closers. So it's different um percentages based on kind of like their uh performance seniority. So like where they at over where they're at over a trending amount of range. Uh basically like if you're in the top tier you make 10% 9% 8% and then all of them are W2. So they make 44 45K a year and benefits and uh and all the stuff. So sales ops manager is essentially someone who's like in here doing a lot of the admin level detail managing in that way. Um and this one is same thing. So like a salary that will that climbs based on performance and company growth. Um, but right now we're stagnant slash down. And because of that, like a lot of these roles aren't growing because they don't have direct KPIs that drive revenue that don't that drive efficiency that you can track. And like that's on me to figure out. And a reason I put this together was because I want to figure out how to compensate everyone based on KPIs that are only upside for the company and only upside for them. So where can they control a KPI that they can get bonused on that isn't going to hurt that is part of the growth. If they make the company another million bucks, they get 50K of it or whatever the numbers are. Um but we need to figure that out at a better way to compensate the team because we got fat and happy no doubt. So chief of people this is another um equitable profit uh profit share position. Um so this one is overarching to the entire company and their department CS manager salaried role. Um these all across basically bases bases oops didn't mean to put that arrow. bases, bases. Um, these right here have uh a communication like bonus pool where if there's refund rates, if there's refunds that come in or escalation is what we call them, and they save them. So, if they keep the refund rate down, they have a bonus pool. So, it's based on a percentage of refund rate because we do like pretty liberally refund if it's within that first like 7-day batch of people who signed and they get buyer remorse or get rebuild on accident. Like, there's all this kind of stuff that happens. So, to keep that refund rate down, we do have a bonus pool for these guys, but it could be better. Um, and then quick jump real quick, but this person, this person, and then this entire layer right here are all on the operations team for us. And in my opinion, we need to come up with a better way to kind of like group comp them or come up with like a profit share that's specific to their department. And I haven't done that yet. So, that's something that I want to work on and put in place, but we haven't done. Um, coaches, these are the premieres. They're basically lead coaches. because they have clients, but they also are like pod leaders is what a lot of the time you call it in sales. So, we're doing the same thing in fulfillment. Um, they make their coach amount and then they also just make an x amount flat fee that's an additional to manage um or in addition to manage, I'm sorry. Um, coaches, this one is one a lot of people ask about, but for us it is based on volume of clients. So, everyone comes in, these are all W2 positions, by the way, almost everyone. Marketing is the couple that are 1099, but everyone else is uh a W2 employee. Um the coach for us the levels are rough numbers but call it like 55 65 75 in those ranges. You hit different salary tiers as you increase your client load. Right? So this is kind of like more or less putting them at a not a cap but like a high end of where we've seen in the past the fulfillment starts to slip and they start to get like less high quality reviews, clients feel like they're too spread out, all that. So we kind of have a a cap in place. Um, but yeah, it incentivizes them to climb and have more clients, which is then easier for us. I mean, same thing as a sales rep or a marketing channel or whatever. It's like if you already have someone on the team that can take more volume, it's better than having to get another coach, go through that process, weed out, one's good, one's not, or whatever, 10% of them stay, whatever the math is, um, it's way better to keep one and have them have more volume and be part of the team. So, we have a ton of super like rockstar coaches. You can see them on the website. Um, but they get paid well across here for us bringing all the clients to them, hosting the platform, doing all those things and they get to work just one-on-one with the client and it's obviously like a heavy workload. Um, but they get to work and just do the part that they like and we do the stuff around them. So, HR manager, same thing, salaried style. Talent experience manager. I didn't have this on the last org chart, but um, this is somebody who handles all the onboarding pieces there. also a rockstar and gets paid um basically that same structure. Oops, I don't know how that happened. And then retention management. This is another new one. And then I'll stop yapping, but retention management is somebody who is in charge of keeping people into the second and third year. So essentially when someone is 60 days out, um they get notified, they book a call with them, um they see where they're at in their journey, how's the first year been, and then basically positions them into a sale for the second year. So, these are all um sales reps that were I'm sorry, they were sales reps and there's two of them right now that uh then were sales managers and then came over into retention management. It's a new division. We don't have any math yet on it on like what works or what doesn't, but we're going to come up with a secondary offer they can do for almost like a downell continuity for the second year. And they get paid commission as well. So, it's commission of what they renew, which for us in the past has been in the coach's hands and they just kind of want to coach, they don't want to sell. And so, we're trying to change the frame of that. But these ones are all making a variable performancedriven piece. Okay. Sales director there, there. And all these other ones are currently making relatively flat amounts. Let me know in comments if you want like breakdowns of actual specifics of these. I don't again I don't want to give out like direct people's incomes, but ranges are pretty obvious across these. Um, and yeah, I think it's way more important to move in the direction of having more and more purple boxes, and that's what I'm going start to work on as we get into like Q3. Right now, it's not important to us to necessarily change these. There's some in here that I can change that would could potentially change behavior, and as long as they're mapped correctly, it wouldn't be an increase in whatever, but right now, it's the goal is to avoid confusion. Not not incentivize people, but not confuse people with harder ones. So unless we can come up with clean metrics on a way to have sales ops manager make more money in that way because they do this or tech to do it in a way that isn't just more confusing and driving the wrong behavior. And I want to make sure that these are clear cut before we roll them out to teams. So little bit of an exhaustive one but I hear that's what you guys like. So let me know if you have any comments.

in today's video I'm going to go through why we are moving over to send blue bubbles instead of green bubbles I'll show you quick stats on some tests we just ran that are insane results uh pockets of traffic that we're looking to apply this in and some limitations I see we last year we did 30 million cash collected and this entire channel is me just sharing what we did do what did work what did not work and what we are actively doing to scale to 100 million a year all with the goal of attracting top talent opportunities and building a solid Network all right so let's get into it so first thing the test we just ran was a 10-day period so it's Mar 2025 right now so the last 10 days of the month basically um and the pocket I'm calling it pocket but like the lane that we applied it to was app notebook so for us when people come in they uh opt in so first name email we don't get the phone number and then application after they watch the vssl which is like 16 questions one of which is phone number then they book then they talk to a sales rep then they buy okay so for us the app no book is about 50% of the applications so you'll get 200 applications in a day 100 of them will book a call with the sales rep and those other 100 go into a lull of where they don't so we have email and SMS and all these things and in current state we send them as green bubbles right so we use SMS that is I don't want to use the service provider we use but just one of the normal ones that direct connects to HubSpot and it sends green bubbles uh and this is an AI bot and I actually have another video on the channel where I talk about this but essentially ingests their application information and then asks them questions and sends them resources based on what their application said so for us we've run this for like a year and we have on average a 2 4% response rate so all we did was swap out like the conduit so we changed it to Blue to Blue sending uh which right looks like IM message and it'll send uh as blue messages versus green messages left everything the same so the AI is the same the questions are the same the context is the same all it is is just a different sending mechanism and for us we went from 24 to 50% response rate so like not even tweaking the prompting or the messaging or the trying to get anything the CTA rate went from 6.5 to 14 so how we track that is basically when it asks them to book a call when it sends them the link so this means that more people are responding to the initial message this means more people are having more conversations that get to a point of uh getting the CTA right because like response is one thing but then continuing the messaging because the CTA goes off depending on the conversation the AI will send it different is it two messages in is it 10 messages in um so this is crazy and our booking rate again it's only a 10-day window so I want more data on this but so far is up from 11 to 16% so whatever that is 50- is% jump so that's huge so for us on as an example th000 bookings happen in a week so that's usually 110 of them come from there so what this actually is is not booked it's of bookings right is the is the metric how we track it so of our total bookings that we had in a given week we used to get 110 as of last week we have 160 so solid jump right 50 bookings increased let's say you have a a 10 to 15% close rate uh or sales per booking rate not close rate cuz close plus sh show or Times show um so yeah I mean right there alone is three units right on five maybe more or I'm sorry on five is five to 7 so that could be like 40K just right there on a onee range which is cool so getting into the pockets uh on here oops in the pockets on here so the simple answer is where can you apply this is like everywhere so you would based on these stats wouldn't you just say like yeah I want to apply it everywhere uh that you send an SMS and yes but no so like for us it is anywhere that how we're looking at it at least is anywhere that it's conversational looking for response so things like notifications like fulfillment reminders that we're not going to change one there's a cost two there's some limitations that I'll get into where it just like doesn't make sense to toggle that over but anywhere that's conversational looking for response because you're going to get in increased response rate and somewhere you have Baseline data so anywhere that you want to have communication have it look like a real person not just be a notification or a reminder uh it makes sense to use for us is how we're looking at it and somewhere you have Baseline data this is crazy important to me because I like like we here it'll just tell you it works right on some of these websites I'll show you it shows that they have like a 90% increase across the board on their clients for me I want to know what our Baseline data is before I do this so for an example like low ticket buyers not booked I don't have data on this yet right so I don't know how many on a normal SMS sending from Green will then uh after they become a low ticket buyer we try and push them to do a call with the setter so like how many of those book in is it 10% or 20% % we don't know that number yet so for me to just apply this like yes it'll work but how much better um so I need to do an accurate test so I did one only on this so this is important to us and for me just because I like to know where the levers are and where it's being pulled um but clearly based on this data you would know it would work better right um so automations and then manual are kind of the two buckets of where you can apply this so for automations for us it's app no booked it's low ticket buyers not booked it's no show cancels anywhere you can have uh so you'd have like a call confir style call confirmation so for us we have a triage team is what we call them but they call confirmation they call Double dial voicemail um to try and confirm the a booking within 3 to five minutes of a booking um and then they SMS if they did not respond so this could be another huge lift fulfillment reminders this is something I wouldn't do and I just want to put this on here as an example because I would want to keep these as no response unless you're going to have someone in house so CS or coaches or whoever that are actively going to monitor this um it just doesn't make sense cuz you don't want responses on those on reminders uh manual who would you then use not an automation to be able to just like access and log in on the back end it directs things to HubSpot which is cool but um sales reps Setters and then the question is fulfillment in coaches so for us our coaches use a dedicated platform that has all of the different uh like Fitness specific things this entire thing is for Fitness um so for us it doesn't make sense because we use an in platform so we don't actually even have phone lines for them they either use zoom or the in chat messaging so doesn't make sense Sal sales reps and Setters this is like the big question for me so getting into limitations as of now and this is what I've seen and again this March 2025 is going change tomorrow as fast as like the tech can change um but right now it's about 50 a day is the limit it is 50 a day so meaning So the plan that we have is like 3K a month or something but it's like API access in five lines so essentially you're paying whatever dollars for one phone number and that phone number can only do 50 new contacts a day but it can do unlimited messages me in right so if you had for us my real example is upwards of 250 app notebooks a day so I need at least five phone numbers because each one of those is going to count as a new contact one person can message that line and go back and forth on a thousand messages but it's just based on the contact so that's fine if you do that but for us because we needed 250 we got the line with fine uh five and we want the API because we don't even have anyone logging into the system to send messages the entire thing for us is API AI based all right so 50 line on line routing this is painful cuz this is how I'm looking at these so once someone has assigned a line to my understanding is they are like stuck in that one line at least on the software we're using right now um it clearly is crushing for us in this way but like if you're trying to use it from a sales rep after they already did an app no book it's like talking to Mandy is the name of our Ai and then after that it's going to be talking to a sales rep and they're using the same phone number and like what's the story behind that and how they would do that oh she's using my phone we're in the same offit like it's just kind of a weird situation um and then yeah that just causes overall confusion so there are like tons of different lines that auto routes through round robin assigns a line picks a contact or I'm sorry contact comes in assigns a line round robin and then they stick to that line um so I'm sure there's some way around that but this is like very limiting for me and trying to understand this um I've had I've heard a hor Moi video where he talks about he's like yeah I just get my sales wrapped iPhones and while that makes sense to me like completely the like for the actual use case the monitoring of it and the ability to see activity tracking stuff inside your HubSpot is very difficult so I I don't know I mean maybe if you have like a super good culture and you have if you're remote and have a super good culture if you're in person and it's like you can see everyone's stuff um maybe that's better but for us it just doesn't make sense right now to get our own iPhones especially with a high turn position like a Setter or ideally not a closer but sometimes closers so providers quick go into this um so I asked in a couple community these are the three that got sent to me I was already in contact with these guys and we worked with someone there a while ago so s BL is who we're currently using so if I just show you these so this is send blue um I think I have my screen like half shared but you can see so essentially it's just instead of sending Android you're sending this opt out language you can send voice notes you can do like the typing text you can do a ton of like ton of stuff um they got us up super fast got us a slack uh setup with them and we use their API and they're very technical and can solve all the things um so this one has worked well for us supposedly it's on the higher end and cost compared to the market uh I cannot confirm what those are but that's who we use I've heard these guys uh link is their name L NQ they do like business cards it looks like but then they also do this so I've heard good things about them and their direct integration to HubSpot ton of people doing this are like go high Lev people they're always at the front end of how to make money on other people's softwares and things like love them hate them but these guys and then this was another one I heard a lot about so uh High blue hu blue um right here I blue yeah these guys um but again we just use these guys s blue so that's current setup um I've heard interesting things like some people have like iPhone Farms some people use like actual Tech and I don't know the answer to that so I'm not endorsing anybody on here this who we're testing and these are some options but yeah this is the this is the confusing part on if we're going to be able to roll this out because I want to be able to do this because if I get these kind of response rates if I could roll this into the call confirm section or reminder section from a sales rep and from call call confirmation team our show rates could like double triple cuz currently we're using allware and we can't even send a video message on the mobile app so we can't even send like a selfie video that is like literally the most important part of trying to get a show rate it's like a personalized video there's no way to do that so we send a loom link and you can only send an image so like it's just it's terrible so if we could do this have the ability to send the multimedia right there we're going to get a lift have the ability to send it blue we're going to get a lift so I just need to figure out the tech behind this and how to do this like on line routing so it comes from the sales rep too um but yeah that's the general gist so hope everyone gets some value from this I'm going to do more of these updates and hopefully soon do some like quarterly updates monthly updates of where we are where we're scaling to and let me know if you have any questions in the comments messaging on Instagram talk soon

# we did $30m last year... here's our plan to hit $100m | E16
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWrB-RNb10Q

in this video I'm going to share our plan to scale our info and coaching business to over $100 million a year I'm going to show you exactly what we did to get to 100K a month a million a month 3 million a month where we're currently at and what we are doing to scale last year we did over 30 million in cash collected and this entire channel is just me sharing what we tried what did work what did not work and what we are actively running all with the goal of attracting a top talent Network and opportunities all right so subscribe below follow me on Instagram and let's get into it so first things first we got to 100K through low tickets which is kind of crazy cuz nowadays in this environment marketing environment um low ticket is more mass and I think even then it was cuz it didn't really work for us but we had just cusp like 100 to 120k a month um basically break even doing low ticket so this is all for Fitness so we were selling a low ticket $27 a month uh recurring access to like a fitness app so meals uh workouts all of that kind of stuff and then also at the same time we were building out an info product that I believe at the time we were selling for like $4.97 that we were not actively running ads to but we tried the auto webinar in vssl but this was the main all right so we had however many thousands of subscribers onto this all paying 27 a month with a low ticket uh uh Oto or I'm sorry a low ticket funnel with an OT for Lifetime access for like $147 so at that time we then moved over to let's do all call funnel so we completely shut this down and moved everything into a vssl call funnel um that we built out in like a weekend at least V1 obviously um and started running at I believe $497 to 9.97 at the time over the phone which is again kind of crazy at the time but that is how we scaled to a million a month so we were selling an info product so login access group coaching and uh community and at $9.97 to $4.97 price when we got up to a million so we did that for many many months um on end and that's how we hit our first million dollar month and it was all through One Singular funnel all right so as we continue to scale we moved it over from instead using that exact same funnel we used for high ticket coaching instead so this entire time we're optimizing the funnel but we're technically still using one funnel all right so we scaled up to 3 million and actually 3.8 was the peak month where we were doing we're now selling High ticket coaching on the back end so instead of it selling info which has great profit margin but no way less LTV at least how we were doing it because there was no Ascension rate they cannibalized each other because they were very similar one was like a do-it-yourself um basically fully or kind of a done with you with the group coaching but but super intensive video courses and access to information so we just completely toggled over and decided to sell coaching specific so now and this is what we actively currently sell uh it is an annual subscription coaching that is 7K plus let's call it so high ticket um and all done through that exact same funnel right now as we scaled still running that same one so the same Pieces come down but acquisition costs have just more and more gotten crazier and they've just gotten much much higher than than where they initially were and the big difference between these two is the Fulfillment cost so like if you're looking at it as the whole company the info has very very little cost to a fill right you're just sending them login access and then whatever it costs to run the community and the group coaching uh which is so nominal in comparison to having one: one coaching so hormos has a good video where he talks about this but he says basically under 20% is what your service should cost um or the delivery of the service should cost so if you're charging $100 a month it should cost you under $20 to perform set service um so our model does fit in in alignment with that but when you do info it's like 1% or like sub percent um so as we scaled there was now increase of filament cost growing team a lot of pain points all at the same time the acquisition is uh the acquisition cost per unit was also growing so what we're currently doing and this number is scaled down we're like 1.5 to2 uh which is not good for us because we have such a high overhead so we can call this like more or less break even um but this this channel is all about just like no I don't um I'm just willing to share whatever so we are scaled down right now uh in terms of everything in terms of uh sales team in terms of overall cash collected just everything as we are rebuilding the acquis acquisition side of the company as that's the most important for us right so sales and marketing business uh on the Forefront so for us we are still running this one and we just had a badass CMO join the team that is going to completely revamped this and he just now launched low ticket so for us initially the low ticket is is based on Ascension focused not on front and row as so we're not trying to optimize for aov with order bumps and um otos and all that kind of stuff our goal is to get them on the phone in order to fill the back end of the funnel which up until now has been our entire company we're B basically taking our entire company and moving it to the back and putting low ticket in front through Ascension so we can liquidate some and the math the unit economics back out to a better way all right so not to say we're not going to change that and that there won't be order bumps we won't try and offset as we scale to hundreds of units a day but just testing and right now we're already selling 30 50 whatever units a day and we just now implemented centers uh Setters OT as a call all that kind of stuff all right so that's where we're currently at and like this is not a great position for us just to be completely blunt um oops so how do I go further there we go um so into the future what the true goal is and how to get this thing to over 100 million and what we're currently doing and this is March of 2025 that we're planning this out multiple low ticket info so I'm going to Super Fan of focus and optimization so like I don't even want to move onto any of this until these are nailed or like either 100% running or completely off like I don't like being Half Baked on 20% in this and 40% in this like over time yes but all of them running at capacity because we don't even know where we could optimize and get 30% more on this layer or this and I look at everything like a funnel so for the low ticket uh version of this it's going to be your cost per click your front end meaning like cuz a lot of the time they're two-step so what's the front end conversion version metric so how can you split that page then to the order form how do you get a higher completion rate on the order form so you have emails on the back end you have Setters you have all that once they book or I'm sorry once they purchase they go to a booking page let's say 30% of those book how do we get that to 50% so same thing uh Setters in there email automation AI what we do raise that now they book with a Setter how many show up for that how many cancel how many turn into sets let's call it 30% how do we increase that layer and then the same thing they're on a closer calendar how do we make sure the shows for the closer calendar the close rate for the closer calendar all the math can back out to call it $1,000 CPA versus a $2,500 CPA right so all of that math is what I like to focus on on the optimizations of this and I think at scale is why it's like super important to focus on unit economics um and really just like the math so once we nail one of these the real goal and the way to truly do this as we've been hearing in the market and we know multip people who do this in the market today that do over 10 million a month that's why this is like this is a Playbook it's already been run this is nothing new no Reinventing the wheel is to then have multiple low ticket uh info direct so these kind of are like a package deal but essentially right now we were on one vssl funnel and we and we are testing one low ticket funnel and they're directly not like super aligned okay like kind of but not super so what we would do is let's say in this Fitness example we would have menopause Focus vssl so all of your ads and all of your um your Landers your vssl all of that would be menopause focus and how you're solving for something that's a menopause Focus problem unique mechanism and then pushing them to apply and phone call in the same way you would also have a menopause low ticket like menopause master class that has XYZ free gifts it's solving for this and it's specifically focused to that so having those two pairings would then allow for us to have a Setter team that's specific to menopause so they buy the low ticket that's menopause they do whatever order bumps that's menopause the call is a menopause implementation call that's with a Setter with a dedicated Setter pod that's all around menopause all right see I'm going with this and then goes to the same backend team that we're back and forth on this and again we don't have to wor even worry about this right now but likely one centralized sales team that closes for all of those so everything is in its own line here and then you have multiple of those and it comes together when people apply Andor just get booked through a set with a closer and then the closers are all selling the same product because they all do solve the same thing and they all the service delivery will be consistent as one at least in current form of plan um for the high ticket coaching but they will all roll right like right here all uh all to a core backend coaching offer and all roads lead to Rome so all these different Lanes of different traffic or I'm sorry different like pain points and offers all will come in and then they'll all liquidate out into one all right now that's the front end as you could call it of the business and just that alone like we know people in that model right now who do whatever five six million a month just on the front end the low ticket like acquisition and then do another five or six million on the back end so that right there is over 100 million just that model in that Playbook now what are other ways to do this in increase or in addition uh graduated backend coaching offer so right now we have nothing ironed out for this uh we currently have like a it's basically a th000 off what you'd pay upfront to continue and then we do twice a year we do a um like Black Friday sabur Monday then like a Christmas and July style thing where it's 5K for a renewal and we'll do like $1.5 $2 million just off that for current customers to renew that's not really a fantastic just like downsell opportunity like it works and it's a nice promo but we need something that's Evergreen so we're building a retention team we're coming up with a new offer so what's important for somebody to stay is it um the coaching side like the personalization is it the accountability is it the community and what's the pricing and then how can we align that with the cost of the coach because if they're only doing this amount of work then they only get paid this amount and then we only charge this amount like making sure that Trio is always working um that's a big one and then just other things that we can sell and then so other LTV boost supplements we've done Partnerships and tried to do this but we've never taken it fully like serious last time we paid this crazy amount for test kits and then they would recommend supplements and we paid like I don't even know how many millions of dollars and got back like 100 Grand like it just the the partnership was not an alignment um and the user experience was not that elevated that it made sense for the cost right swag we do have a swag thing but like again right now we don't sell low ticket like very very little this is more or less us right now so we're just selling High ticket coaching so that's three four 500 units a month which is like not a needle mover when you do swag and supplements like it can be I guess if you like really do a continuity play with subs and stuff like that but for us it's like let's have thousands of customers first a month and like if we do low to get right we'll have 200 500 a, new units a day and then these supplement things in these smaller recurring amounts can add up to large numbers but for us it's just hmates sunet uh swag we do have a store that has this but same thing it's like it's such needle it's such little thing and because we want quality and not this crazy cost um we basically just break even on it it's just like a brand play and then software this is like the big question mark and everyone talks about it and it's distracting and it's all these things so I'm going to leave it in this this may be distracting shiny object bucket but if this thing turns into a machine if and when this turns new machine and scales to these numbers there may be enough time and allocation where myself and other others on the team te can dedicate that to building out software that's specific to the space so there are AI plays already that I know of that would work for our specific market and essentially we could be the first client as I know of tools that we use that would be a lot better if we could customize XYZ and we already have the marketing chops to be able to do it so this is like the fairy tale question out there fugazi thing but all of these are like direct and we know the Playbook is there I mean Playbook is even there for software it's just like a completely different play that I'm not interested Ed in being distracted by until we hit these numbers and we're doing 10 million a month um so this is our current goal this is our plan um I want to just have this channel to be able to update on what we're doing in this and just to tell you so like right now we're doing this um current stats are looking good we're 60% liquidating on the front end on testing right now with no aov boost other than just like literally the One Core product cost um OT is booking out call it 50% we don't have stats on how many Setters turn into sets but was like 30 to 40% of those set calls or I'm sorry of those direct bookings with Setters turned into closer calls and then uh now we just have to see how many of those back out we did have our first one that already came through like two days in of uh set to close of like the first whatever eight or nine calls so good things uh good things to come but yeah this is a very very direct response heavy focused business when in the past it was kind of that but all in one funnel which was just silly and we know that in like in hindsight we would have done a lot of this earlier but we're here now and we can't so got up to 3 million a month did 30 million a year and cash collected scaled down um because of acquisition and we didn't want to just dig into like this red hole um and doing whatever around a million and a half 2 million right now just like getting our bearings and rebuilding all the stuff in terms of acquisition while the rest of the company still operates as is so all the coaching all the backend all fulfillment inhouse all of that's operating and we basically make no money at those numbers um and now it's how do we scale this thing back up to then go three 3 5 10 right so that's the update uh like I said hit me up on Instagram for questions comments anything like that and then subscribe on YouTube and ask any comments in the thread below I'm just going to share as we go so talk soon

# Here is How we Made $30.36 Million using  AI + high ticket sales | E15
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNE7QEPFWnc

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go into leveraging AI for sales. I'm going to go through our approach and how we look at where to implement AI, what hasn't worked for us, what is working for us, and where we see future opportunities. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected with these tools implemented. And this channel is just me sharing what we've tried, what hasn't worked, what has worked, uh, and what we're doing to scale to 100 million a year. All right, so to start the approach. So first things first, we look at it as like a waterfall effect, right? So where there is places that humans can do it on our team and get a better efficiency in relation to cost, we would rather do that, right? So if there are places and I'll go into kind of examples of what hasn't worked, but we want to look at ways that we can either use AI to make the team more efficient or replace out pieces. But if there is a piece that is better suited and gets a and gets the same or a better result in terms of return on cash, then we are going to use AI. And if not, we're going to use human. Okay. So for examples of that, what hasn't worked? So opt no app email. So this is just basically for us our funnel is uh is opt-in. So first name, email, application, book a phone call, get on the phone, purchase. All right. So that opt no app, all we have is their name and email. We don't collect their phone number. So with that, we can only remarket to them via email. So what we did with this was basically create kind of crafted, but there's not too much customization you can do because you only know their name and email. So you can do AI data enrichment, you can try and gather info on them. You can pull social profiles, you can do like a lot of stuff. Uh we felt that was too uh invasive maybe is the right word. U so all we were doing was just trying to get a prompted email response and we got it up a little bit where we're getting like an okay response early in the sequence and then just having AI take over the conversation and it just was not effective. Like it was the the unit count was so low in terms of just like conversations, let alone apps then bookings then call like further down the funnel. Um, so we just turned this off just because it was kind of confusing and it was add an extra layer. I've heard people have this work. So all these are to say what hasn't worked for us in future opportunities. Like people are crushing this. So this whole channel is me just sharing what we did, what we're doing, not about what is the right necessary way. It's just me sharing kind of our view on it and where we're at. Um, so I know people crush with this in email uh and do it a lot with setters for sure like oh reply to this if you want this and then just have setters manage the inbox. You could do the same thing with AI like theoretically. Um, booking confir booking confirmation voice. This was like way too long of us trying to do it. To my understanding, nobody out there has this handled to a way that it can handle it properly, right? Like they have uh I'm forgetting the name of the software. Um, but there's a really really good one that got backed by Y Combinator that we were plugged into and it's crushing for reservations, for uh delivery orders, for like all those kind of things, barber appointments, like in that. But for us and how our current text stack sits and how it sounds, it has all this super cool stuff that basically would make it so like it already knows what to say a portion. So it can start responding while the API calls are happening. So there's no like latency between when you say something and then you have to wait however long for AI to do its thing and then come back and then do the voice and then repeat it. So there's like that's a lot of time why there's the delay. So this has like super cool functions and modules that would break out and based on this based on this response it would route them. it could pre-frame and say, "Okay, that's interesting." Um, so based on what you said, and then in the background be doing the API call. So it can fill in then the AI section of the message. So super cool, but for us, it just didn't dynamically work. So we tried to use it for booking confirmation. So call them within 3 minutes of them booking a call. Hey, is this still like just confirm you do know it's a Zoom call? You do know that uh it's this time zone that you selected. Uh go here to get your homework. like if they had any bit of like just the pron the pronunciation was still off like even if you hardcoded stuff names were way off uh even on simple names and we tried pretty hard to get this to work like our our team did and it just wasn't doing it and Calend's API is all crazy so to be able to like reschedule someone or cancel their time or like do any of that stuff it was more or less like just doing that and then needed to notify Slack channel and we had multiple people like call out like oh is this AI and that's just not what we're looking for. So, we replaced this we replaced this part with a call confirmation team that is 20 hours a day, 7 days a week. Um, they're a call center and they're out of Lebanon, I believe. And they sound better. They don't sound like perfect, but they sound better. And the stats go to show like anybody who confirms with them is like a 70% show rate. So, whatever is it still works like just goes to show it could probably be like 80 or higher. So, we have 65% of those get claimed. And then of those that get claimed, 70% of those show up versus like 40ome. And again, I I said in other videos like current state is this entire thing is down. So I'm believing it's a marketing thing and like an overall framing, but that's where we're currently at. So booking confirmation SMS. This one I do believe this would still work. So how we were doing it was they were texting. So the call confirmation team that's actual live agents is calling and texting. Then the next piece is a uh SMS that was going to come from the sales rep. But instead we were like let's use AI and just nurture them say hey saw your application based on the information I think this resource would be interesting to you let me know when you check it out and they would have dialogue back and forth all right with the AI bot that is basically nurturing them within that 48 hour window before they get on the phone. Why this was I think just kind of confusing was we were trying to like parlay like three four things because you have an SMS potentially is coming from triage if they can't or call confirmation team and voicemail whatever which is one phone number. Then you have AI texting which is one phone number. Then you have the sales rep texting and then a lot of time you'll use like Calendarly or a third party uh that also has texting. So you're texting from four different lines. Like it's just confusing. So we pulled it out and we didn't see any direct change. Um we're also trying to reference the text be like oh hey I saw you had a conversation with Mandy or like I I got caught up from Mandy on the conversation and like if the person didn't respond you needed like routing. It just got too messy for what didn't need to be. Um this entire portion of the of the company right now is like a major pain point. So, I'm looking at all kinds of things. There's a lot of guys who have really good uh videos about this. Um, but are basically we need to solve for getting higher show rates and getting more live calls because that is a crux for us right now. Um, that I'm working on. But, so these are the three things just off the top that I had that we used for sales within AI that did not work for us at the time. Not to say voice isn't there yet or when it is like of course we'll jump. Um, this just doesn't really like make sense. But I'll show you where we do use it. So where we are using it is this exact same AI system but for app no books. So right someone opts in they apply but then they fall off before they book. So about 50% call it of the people that apply do not book and that is there's a lot of ways around this. You can combine them. So it's 100% but then is your overall number less likely um all kinds of things. So for us app not booked we feed in that information from their application because now we have context right. So, when we try to do it on the opt-in, there's nothing contextual to talk to talk to them about that's about them to point them back into the sequence through email. But in this in SMS, we do because we know they've tried this, they've tried Jenny Craig keto, this is their goal. Um, here's their timeline, here's the, you know, financial qualifiers, all that stuff. So, we can have a conversation that's educated. So, the first one sends in, it's basically like, "Oh, I saw this information. I thought this would be interesting for you." um sends that out to them and then just starts dialogue and then pushes them to a call to action which is just book a call which is just like a whatever companyame.comcall and that right now just that sequence alone is like 12 to 14% depending uh of our overall bookings which is crazy so like of a thousand bookings in a week 140 of them come from having a conversation in the abn no book sequence which is great um so yeah so we use it there AI infused confirmations this instead of using this portion up here for the booking confirmation, we essentially infused the SMS from the sales rep. So instead of having the sales rep get a booking and have to like reach out and if they're on calls and they're busy, we dynamically send it 30 minutes after. And again, not to say this is perfect because like our show rates aren't good right now. I don't think it's because of this, but like this is what we're actively doing. Um it'll send them be like, "Hey, I saw your application or hey so and so, this is blank, your sales rep from blank company. um I I will looked at your application. I think this would be really valuable to you. And then it looks up a database that we have set of all of the stuff on site. So like all the different resources, the different podcasts, the different video uh reviews, all of that. And then we'll send that to them dynamically and be like, "Did you check it out?" And then it responds back to the sales rep. So no actual AI uh conversation or communication, but just infused to dynamically find information and write messaging for that initial message. Right? So this one's good. Uh we do get a ton of responses on this. And the other thing with these is we've been using Alawware as our text stack for that and which is green bubbles and like normal. Um but we just rolled out send blue send whatever theirs is. And we have like before we had like a 24% response rate and now we have like a 50s something response rate. So whatever they're doing works now. We have to see how it backs out and over time but like we just changed the conduit. Exact same messaging, exact same AI system. Um and then we have a senior tech lead on the team who is just like a rockstar. So he's one who actually built these. We've used tools in the past like Max and other ones. I don't want to name direct names, but like they work too. This was just cheaper and more customizable for us in-house after we got to a certain point. So, um, sales call review. This one's super good. So, ZRA is what we used instead of Gong. So, this basically you can have like a checklist that goes through your entire sales call. So, it's connected to Zoom. So, Z is a Zoom revenue accelerator, I believe. Um, and it's like an add-on, not that expensive, uh, in comparison to Gong. And what you can do is one, it just does all the normal stuff you're seeing. So like keywords and like um how often things are brought up and phrasing and uh talk time percentages. It does all that on top of the recording. So you can look at the recording and see all the notes. And then the other really cool part that I like the best um that we use is like a scorecard. So you can have a scorecard that's like did they um set the tone? Did they show authority in the beginning? Did they um do XYZ objection handling? Or like did objections come up? Uh did they go through multiple pricing options or just one? Did they like ask all these questions? And it will answer yes, no. It can do it on scales. It can give you like free former. It can do all this crazy stuff. So, it does all of those. And the best part is when it says like did they uh did they give a make themselves like authority in the beginning, it'll say yes or no, but under it, it'll give a text box and be like this is why they said this and this and this and like this showed direct authority or expertise in the space and that's why I said yes, which is super cool because not just like autofill. I like the context behind it. Very helpful. So, our sales team uses this and um our setters aren't using this now. We just started setters this week. Um but it's been super super helpful um to be able to see and then like bucket things. Closer script. This is kind of a fun one. Um so we went through and using that tool, well kind of a separate tool, but uh because we have all that stuff built in the AI section for the messaging, um we basically took all of the closed deals of the last whatever 50 deals or 100 deals, I don't remember number, and I didn't do this. our senior tech lead and our sales manager did this together and reported back. But so they basically took all of those they took the transcripts from all the zooms they fed them in and they were like find commonalities and trends in this uh on the sales side that like what were the commonalities and then they built like a framework portion to the script. So, our sales manager doesn't fully believe in. He always says like, you know, no scripts in 2025. But, um, yeah, it's it it found like a ton of commonality and ways that we could leverage and pieces were like, "Oh, that's interesting." Like, all of the closed calls said this or went into this range or, you know, they only had x amount of objections, so clearly they were handled before. If we could lean into that for more leads. So, stuff like that. Um, I'm sure there's other ones, but I'm kind of just forgetting right now. But, future opportunities. So, add comments and inbox. We tried this for a minute. So, I guess we did try this is the what hasn't worked. Um, we tried this and we didn't like how the responses were and it was also like autoresponding to everyone and us being like female only. There's a lot of men that are just straight up creepy and just like messaging stuff and that just it was weird because we're doing it from an expert um from the co- uh co-founder of the company and it was just like it was weird. So, we turned it off. Um, and right now we have our CS team in there. But, this is a super good one that I know a lot of people do this. And then same thing with the inbox, like having the autorespond on the inbox doing this. Um, we don't use it for CS either. I know. Oh, I guess. Well, sorry. I'll stay in sales. This one's only sales because we have a bunch of other stuff that we do that's AI, but I'm trying to keep this one just sales. So, the low ticket buyer notebook. This is brand new to us. So, we're selling like 30 to 40 of these a day right now. Testing. Uh we just launched a bunch of split tests and we have the Otto on the back end to book a call. So 20 will buy a day. Now how many directly book? Let's call it 10. So like 50% of them are auto booking and that is direct on that page that's like hey schedule implementation call. They end up talking to a setter. Uh it's also pushed them via text and email on post purchase. Um and then inside the product after consumption it actually goes direct to a closer in current state. But that 50% like what happens to the other 50? So, another idea is having text threads that are prompting responses. Instead of just like a blast to them, it's like, "Hey, book your call here." It can ask them questions and then be AI and then have a different call to action, different uh prompting to lead them to go to here to book your call. That's round robin. So, this would be a nice little lift, but we just launched this, so we're trying to get like baseline number numbers before we do any optimization. Dynamic calendar reader. So, this is kind of twofold. The one uh the one I built or had built is pretty nice and does that for like spots and all that. That's one piece. But what I really mean by this specific is we used to use an SMS AI that would dynamically read the o availabilities on your sales team's calendar. So instead of like we use Calendarly round robin. So it would actually look direct to Google calendar and instead of through Calendarly because all messy with their API. So, um, it would be like, "Hey, are you available tomorrow at 2, uh, at 2:30 p.m. Eastern?" And they're like, "Yeah." And it's like, "Okay, cool. I'll book you in." And it generates a booking for them direct through Google Calendar. And this is when we used it. So, maybe they have like the booking widgets connected now and they use certain ones, but it was a lot of zaps and back and forth, but it worked like crazy, like crazy crazy. So, between we would likely build this in house. These guys are awesome. Like super super nice guys and like super cool that they showed us this and we used it for a while for when we had like two setters a year and a half ago or two years ago. Um but a dynamic calendar reader would be insane for us because it would be able to take all the setter calendars look at the round robin and be like hey are you free at this time? Hey you free this time with everyone at messages. Oops. And then auto book them in for 15-minute slots that then get set. And like last time we did this we were booking like 10 hours of 15-minute calls like 2 3 days in advance. Like it just wouldn't stop. And so we would likely be able to do that ourselves now. So being able to build this into this and others where instead of it just pushing to book uh like pushing them to a link to book on their own, instead we could dynamically do that and that would be AI messaging and then not really AI but just kind of like the tech side of finding that the AI portion is more so in the messaging. Um no shows and cancels. Same thing here. Same messaging thread. um just doing it for no shows and cancels trying to win them back because that's a huge piece for us if 60% of your calls show which 60% of our calls do not show right now um but 40% of them where do they go and they could get in the same messaging ring and then in Slack automations and then I'll stop talking or actually I'm going to give a quick little business update but um in Slack automations is essentially like I've seen people have it so like when a deal comes in it'll AI it'll like push over to AI and come back with um summaries about the person their journey so far they've reviewed this content based on page views. Um, after the sales call is done, it'll push in like a review from a sales manager, like based on the transcript, here's what you could have done better. Here's how I would follow up. Pre-written follow-ups. Like, we don't use any of that. Um, so we're trying to just optimize, like I said, waterfall wise, like find the inefficiencies. And this is just sales. We have this in like coaching and we have this in marketing and we have this in contact. Like we have this in a bunch of places um at some level, but there's just tons of opportunity and it's only getting better. So yeah, that's kind of the general gist of where we use AI in our sales. And then yeah, just quick business update. So setters are live, low tickets live. Um closers are trying to close. Uh we're trying to make it work and marketing is trying to fill and change how they're doing optimizations around the ads. Um because we think that may be a main reason for the show rates being where they are. So there's just like a lot of things in the fire. Had Q2 on Tuesday. This is March of 2025. Um had Q2 and crushed it. All the new teams on there. So, super exciting things ahead. Super super exciting. Uh, a lot of really good people on the team who have done these things before, which is cool because we've never been in a position where that's placed. So, I'm excited to see uh like I said, we're closing whatever or uh we're selling 30 to 40 low ticket right now, testing and trying to figure out the back end and how many book in with setters and then how many book in from setters to closers and then how many back out. But we already had our first setter close um I think two actually, one or two already uh in like the first two or three days. So yeah, it's exciting for us and I will update you more as we go. As always, Instagram for communication uh DM uh on there and then comments below here. Any questions where you think or tell me where I'm wrong or missing something or something. Um these are no ego. This is just me trying to share what's working for us. So anything that you guys want to know, I am happy to share. Right.

# my plan to use youtube to hit $100M/Year ($30M last year) | E14
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCLpayQM7p4

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through my plan for YouTube and how I intend to use the platform so we've done 70 million in cash collected in total through One Singular call funnel uh 30 million of which was last year scaled over 100 employees and the goal of this channel is for me to share what we've tried what we're currently doing um what is broken and how we are currently scaling to 100 million a year in cash collected all right so today I'm going to go through target audience current stats goals plan and then a Biz update uh where we're currently at and just kind of go through how I'm thinking about this YouTube channel specifically so to get into it target audience so industry business owners doing 100K a month and adjacent so what I mean by adjacent is not just call funnel owners not just info and coaching but there's also a lot of overlap on kind of things within the online business that are uh relevant to people who are in physical e-commerce for example or other online chunks and spaces so 100K a month I'm just using as just a rough estimate um because a lot of these things that I share are 2 five 10% lifts at different parts of your funnel or business um and for you to get a ton of the value it really is kind of like more detailed the stuff for like 0 to 10K is not really in my wheelhouse and also a lot of this stuff is just not going to be relevant to them because they have to find product Market fit and all that so really who I'm targeting is this in current state all right so current stats this is one you can write home about but 150 YouTube subscribers and 1,000 on IG so these are the two like conversion numbers or stats I guess that I'm going to use as kpis so the goal here is not 100,000 YouTube subscribers at least not in like current form with the current content it really is just like a Honeypot small zone of people that are in the space that are actually getting value from this not as much like Mass Market 0 to 10K uh fancy edits and clips and all that kind of stuff like that's just not the goal um and then using Instagram more so for the same thing but using it for uh communication and like actual direct following because obviously you can't see like YouTube subscribers necessarily who they are and have good communication so so far um 150 and has been going on whatever a week or something maybe two weeks of content that I've been posting uh and then a thousand on Instagram that are then also coming in through here and I have some crazy stats but like my comment or reach out from view rate is like crazy high right now which is great because that's kind of the goal is just to do that so to go into the goals real goal is to get out of the cave is one right I've been in online marketing for like almost 10 years and have never really shared anything or like come out of the cave um we've been running this business specifically for 5 years six years at this time um and I just haven't shared anything so I think just getting out of the cave and just making these is a huge boost for me personally uh and selfishly so the actual goals of this though in terms of content are network opportunities and talent so what I mean by that is again Network part of the out of the Cave thing terrible super introvert in terms of like networking and a little bit better online but like in person terrible um so being able to find and have a network of people who are also in the space who are also succeeding who can bounce ideas off like this is all I think about all I talk about all the time and it's kind of dry to not have that in your life in any other place and I don't really have this so building out a network is huge so that's why I say like Instagram followers and DMS and seeing stories and back and forth with other people in the space is like huge value to me so definitely trying to grow here as the main from that then comes opportunities so people who are maybe at lower ranks of this or even the same or just getting started like having opportunities that come where someone already has product Market fit and it's like how can I scale this and whether that's something I end up getting financially and business involved with that's one thing or just actually just helping um but over time I see this as you know like this is more or less like an acquisition. comom playay so how horos and them do it they create all this free stuff um ton of free value content and eventually funnels down into um business owners sharing their stuff with them and getting opportunities to do deals with them uh I mean maybe that's a long-term approach but right now it is just like feeling out the network and seeing what happens with opportunities and then Talent is a huge one so without being out and well known whether it's the company or you as an individual uh it could be kind of hard to attract Talent so as we begin to scale we need the best of the best talent within our specific space um there are people who come from outside of the industry and come in and Crush but like tried and true there are people who are in another company or in uh doing their own business for example uh like Ean has a really good video talking about how he has people who will do you know 300K a year in their own starter business but they want to just work somewhere that they can make the same kind kind of income uh without having to have the headaches of like actually being a business owner so being able to find quality talent and people who want to work with you and be a part of your team that work for you um is huge so these are the main goals that I'm looking for um and then if you want to like connect those back to actual stats I don't have a number I don't have if this is 2,000 or 20,000 or what it is but the current like soft metrics is something like 10 to 15% of people that are uh watching the videos are already dming and following and talking which is huge so that's really the goal of this and just beating the drum on that so my plan and how I'm looking at it is raw no fluff no BS no ego um so for a long time definitely had this and I'm glad I kind of shed at least a layer of it and we'll see how much further it goes but I just hate the online stuff that's fluff and like crazy edits and all like there's a time and place for that and especially if you're going Mass market and you're trying to get the click and you're trying to do that but for me it's just not important and it's also not important for the goal right the goal is not to have 100,000 views on something in current form this may change but like that's not the goal I also have don't have anything that's Mass Market that I'm trying to or even like mid-market that I'm trying to offer I'm not trying to sell anything I have no interest in doing that um so I already have people asking for Consulting and stuff like that and like maybe in that realm just because it helps me sharpen it and I also like to just help um but overall the goal is just raw no fluff no BS no ego like here's what's happening now and I'll share some of that in the biz update uh in the trenches actively building so for example like I made a video yesterday about uh sales team comp because I'm inside the sales team dashboards rebuilding things we're talking comp we're talking about how we would adjust it who else is doing it in the space and I just want feelers out and just to be able to like actually show what we're actively doing right I said in the very beginning the goal of this is to get this to 100 million a year in cash collected and Like A lot's going to change and yes we have incredible leaders and team that are doing a lot of stuff that I can do overviews on but like I'm still actively doing things as well like directly um we always call it like clicking the buttons so it's like we're getting things done or you're actually clicking the buttons uh I'm trying to get out of clicking the buttons a little bit more uh as we continue to scale just for True scale and like to make this a machine um but yeah so constantly evolving this is in terms of the actual content so first couple videos audio sucked using a studio display right here and audio sucked and everyone was telling me that it sucked in my DM so got a mic like that's how I'm looking at this is like find the next breakpoint um content is getting pushed out I'm getting whatever 2,000 Impressions let's call it on a video with like a0 2% clickthrough rate cuz the thumbnails the thumbnails or the titles are terrible so what did I do there's a guy reached out to me that said he could do it for XYZ price and he'll do thumbnails and titles for the entire account it's like cool go ahead do it right um zoomed out ugly content I was looking at these docs for example way zoomed out I had all the text already plugged in there so you could see everything and there was no like you know this blacked out section down here and all of this is like you know day over day week over week like I I'm sure I'll look back on this and be like wow these were terrible um but I started and that's really all I care about is that I'm actually just doing it um so that's what I mean here by zoomed out ugly content rambling plan content okay so like even just putting this document together versus just opening a spreadsheet and kind of riffing live is in the right direction it could be a lot better right like my packaging of how I'm doing this could be a lot better uh but this is the initial State and just kind of how I'm able to do it every single day as of now and maybe that'll change to a couple times a week but getting into building in public it might not be a couple times a week because there's constantly stuff happening so right now it's just like info there's a way to maybe make it into like infotainment but again that's like a whole team or job or something that I don't know that I'm really looking to do or interested in at this time um but what I mean by building public is the videos aren't as much like Evergreen in the way that like how to get your first 10,000 followers on Instagram right like that video can be watched at any point and it's the sameish style what I'm looking to do is more so like vlogging is a good example like in the Life uh like real time because I want to be able to do like real updates and be able to be okay yesterday we did x amount of cash collected or these stats or this last month we did this and I think that'll be super valuable for people to see like where our evolution is and what we're doing and also for to look back and be like where did we fail where did we succeed oh 6 months ago we had these stats what happened and change cuz now they're down like being able to do that with the real goal here have 100 million cash collected all right so this is not that out of touch especially how we're changing things with acquisition um with with our acquisition model um so I think this is like super realistic and what we're targeting the timeline I you know definitely not in 2025 I wouldn't see it as unless we hit some like crazy scale um but into the next year I could see it um real behind the scenes like I said and then I need to figure out a better way but I want to be able to build in public but in order to show stuff sometimes there's like customer info or team info and I don't feel comfortable sharing that because like they didn't sign up for this and that's just not allowed so um I need to figure out by way here but that's the general gist of like how I'm looking at this so if I was to get to 2,000 or 5,000 or whatever of like actual proper business owner following um there's a lot of great guys who do it like uh Ravi has a good Channel his a little bit more mass Market he has an offer um Jeremy Haynes has one that's really good but his is like Advertiser kind of specific but all about call funnels getting to a million a month um he has really good content like so they are targeting specific buckets of the pocket um or Pockets like within the market uh which I love so that kind of style um but in current state their stuff is a little bit more edited up than mine and maybe I'll get there or want to get there but in current state I don't want to so um that's where we're at and then Biz update this is where I want to go and talk about where I'm saying like info uh real updates all this so Biz update and current state so last year we did 30 million cash collected uh last month and like current state is 1.5 million a month okay so like not good right so I want to be able to share like fluff and or no fluff no BS about that so for us currently it's our show rate our close rate and like also the quality for marketing it's that it's that dance I talk about in other videos about marketing and sales so we study State got to 3.8 I think was our Peak month in 2024 and again over the entire year it was like 30.5 million in cash collected uh and right now we're trending you know whatever that is 4.5 million a quarter like not good 20 million so for us right now we're having a show rate issue so our show rates are 45 to 50% we changed a bunch of stuff automation broke things are uh trending or not trending uh um showing on Google result if you look up like our brand name so we're having like all these issues around that close rate is a sales team issue that we're just having in general so that is everything from vibe made other videos about like um the comp model and how it can not necessarily in incentivize correctly so like we're looking at tons of different things on how to solve for this but if I was just to look at the marketing side for example it's like okay so we could do better quality because the biggest complaint from sales which always will be but right now it's definitely like a little bit hotter is the quality and then also the shows so shows in the we currently look at them as like a marketing thing not a salesperson thing which I'm back and forth on but like that's how we've done it forever because it's all the automations it's the framing like there is a marketing portion um but sales really has like no responsibility for it at all um and that I think is an issue so not having any like control or feeling like they have control and getting just 50% of their bookings just taken off their calendar because people don't show up or cancel is like not ideal um so when we were truly crushing we head it at like 55 60% um and I've heard of people going to 70 80% it's just something we've never solved for so their close rate their live call close rate is down as well so it's not even just so that that could be you know quality as well so all to say marketing is working on this and doubling down and what we're doing marketing is uh we're transitioning to just better like we just had a new CMO come in that is an absolute rockar in the space and he's like a week in so none of this is reflective of that um so in a month I could say oh cool we're at 3 million right like it's that quick of a a flip of a switch that could happen um because calendars are 80% booked but the actual um the close rate and like the sales per booking is down so if we just solve for that and it's not necessarily just that but if we just saw for sales for booking and went back to our normal rates we would be at 3 million a month like it's that simple um and it's that simple but it's not that easy so with marketing we're doing new things we're doing low ticket so we just launched that and uh with low ticket we're doing Setters as well so booking in as that uh post call or I'm sorry postp purchase call that they can go in and they'll talk to a Setter um then they talk to a Setter get pushed on a closure calendar so ideally that's higher intent because or higher quality because they're a buyer not a lead they have then also been set and been qualified so ideally what you think is the math backs out that you have higher show rates higher close rates more qualified person and that whole chain of events now we're also doing this with Setters on the current vssl funnel so finding drop off in the app not booked um and then also we're almost there but we're going to likely take like direct bookings that would come from either DQ or from anywhere in the automations and instead of instead of putting them straight to closers vet them through so only allowing the whatever percent of people to come through that already qualify and hit all the boxes and have the intent to book a call and then anyone else that we're trying to like recapture or push back through automations um and that's email and SMS and all those pieces uh pushing them to Setters to get qualified so that's the goal that's where we're at right now um I know this is kind of like more of a selfish or just like me video but I think it's important just to share like what the goals are and just kind of how I'm thinking about it uh CU anyone can do this and I just forever uh put this off and didn't do this part right and uh I wish I would have so now we're here so again subscribe go on Instagram for communication and following there and uh drop any comments below this uh if you have any questions or want me to talk about anything specific so I will talk to you guys soon bye

# How We Paid Out $30M to Our Sales Reps | E13

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through sales team comp. Last year we did 30 million in cash collected all through a sales team and what this channel is all about is me sharing what we did, what we're doing now and how we are evolving to get to 100 million a year in cash collected. All right, so let's get into it. So first things first, uh this has changed over time a ton and in current state we have everyone as W2, right? So to get to future scale, potential exit, just more stability, we wanted to move everyone to W2. Um, so at one point we had up to 30 sales reps, 30 and some change sales reps. Um, and then again to be as transparent as possible, no fluff, no guru Uh, this is currently like the crux of our company. Uh, marketing is doing well. It's it's always a dance, right? It's like quality from marketing, uh, show rates and all of that. That is a marketing and sales piece and then sales team closing. So right now this is a crux for us. But I just want to go into the sales team comp because today I was working on part of the dashboard and I figured this would be helpful. So first things first, uh, let's do this. So for us right now we have a base because everyone's W2. Okay. So this is like 44K, right? So yeah, that times 26 is like 44. Um we do a bi-weekly payroll. So it is just like a two week range for us. It's Sunday to Saturday twice over. Um the it is a draw base. Everyone gets benefits and 401k, right? So everyone is W2 full employee. So no matter what they're getting this 1692. So this does create issues when marketing can only fill 30% calendars or uh poor performance weeks, right? Like it is an increase to what you would be paying if you had 1099 flat commission rates. All right, this is a security thing. This is good for people uh to feel more part of the company and to stay in the role uh even if they do have bad couple weeks or something and you know they can turn it around and just have to get out of a funk. So for us we use three different tiers. These tiers are junior adviser, adviser and senior adviser. Okay, this is defined by their sales per booking percentage over I believe right now it's a 60-day range is is like the most stable number. Uh we've done it over shorter amounts of time like 30-day and beyond. But um and I mean and shorter. Uh but what this is defined as so like sales per booking for us when someone's crushing it is like 15%. Average call it 13 10 is like minimum should be at and then below that is like need some work. And again right now to be 100% candid this is not even where we're at. We're not even at 10% right now and we're having like huge issues with that in terms of marketing and sales connection. So quality show rates as well as closing percentage like this just not meshing. Um so we're working on that actively but in current state uh if someone has a high sales per booking they're in the senior adviser uh basically normal or anything below and still on the team they're on adviser and junior is only used for ramping reps. Okay so junior is going to be you're just like getting their feet wet and getting into the company. Those are reflective of this. they make an 8 n and 10% commission on cash collected net cash collected. So refunds that happen within the first 30 days and I'll go into that in some of this additional portion. Uh also claw back. So anything that happens after that first 30 days is we put it on the company um because we don't feel as if it was the sales rep's fault that someone uh that someone refunded in the clawback. So it's just not on them. Bonus tiers. How we do this is essentially here I'll just break into this right here live. We use a uh a point system for our bonuses. So if you sell a dollar cash collected during the week on a week day you get one point and if it's a weekend you get 1.5 points. So, what this mainly does is incentivize weekend volume because right now I mean W2 technically you could tell them when to work um specific hours and like do it like that where you can have like certain reps that only work on weekend and because we're W2 we can kind of like mandate those times. Not really our culture and our vibe like we always push for it and we incentivize it directly. When we were 1099 this was the initial kick for this because we just wanted them to open it up and there's no as 1099 you're not supposed to tell them specific when they can and can't work. you have the brackets and the 6 a.m. to midnight, but you can't specifically tell them when to work and like what to do exactly. Um, so that was another reason we moved over to W2. I still don't know if that was a good call. Uh, I mean cash-wise, it's a 20% increase in cost. Um, there's like this bottom level of stability that almost makes it so it's like cushier in my opinion. Um, I'm not sure. Since we've done it, we've had a ton of issues in terms of like marketing and like all these other places in the company and that has then also been reflective in sales. So, I can't say like causation correlation on that, but it thus far has not been great and we've just paid more. Especially like if marketing is filling 30% of calendars, everyone is hitting base or just staying at base because they can't get enough units and you're paying out bases versus where you would be paying commission only amount depending on your structure. And then you also wouldn't have the 20% kicker of benefits, employer tax, like all the jazz. So, for this, what'll happen is when you hit 60,000 points, so quick numbers to look at this is like 60,000 in cash collected. You do have reps that are going to optimize for the weekends, which is amazing. That's the whole point. So, they will be getting higher. But just for quick numbers, you can just look at this as cash collected. So, 60K points, $3,000 bonus, 100K 6, 140, 9, and 180 12. Okay. And again, this is over a twoe range. All right. So, we've had people uh on the team that have made three I think someone made over 400,000 definitely in 300,000 as a sales rep for us when like we're fully cooking uh and doing like really well. So over time we you'll have churn, you'll still have those who go to different offers. If marketing stops performing, you can lose those members. So like it can be really tough to maintain and hold them. And that's why we try and do everything around culture. Um so let me just go through some examples of these. And this should be like a pretty quick video. All right. So someone who does 120k cash collected as an example. Now again, we're going to use this as just like simple because the points technically with 120k cash collected, if they did 40k of that over the weekend, that would be equivalent to 60 and they would actually have 140k. And that's where I'm going to show these bonuses. But simple math is someone who's doing 120k is already in top tier because they're clearly one of the top people. So if they're doing 120k cash collected, they'd make a 12k base and they would do uh 6 to9k bonus because they would fall into this bucket if it was all on weekdays. And if it was on weekends, they would have hit this 140K threshold and gotten a 9K bonus. So they would make anywhere from 18 to 21K for the twoe range, which is amazing, right? Because if you crush that across, that's like 40K a month on average. And again, there's dips, there's lols, there's big ones, there's sale weeks, there's like all this kind of stuff that can affect that. But top closers are in this range or have been in this range. In current state, we don't even have this. So 55K cash collected, someone's going to make 4.9K uh 4.95K. I use the 9% on this because this person is probably just in middle tier. They're not top, but they're in this middle tier. They'd make a 4.9K, 9% of 55K. And then depending on if they were in the weekend or not on some of these points, they would hit this 3K bonus. So they'd make anywhere from call it 5 to 8K uh across this twoe range. So again, this person too is if they're just above this, if they're making 60 65k cash collected in a given week, u which is about 10 units, call it for us. Um then right there, they're at 8K every two weeks, 16K. So for that, they're already making 200 grand a year. Okay, on that math, now you have the 10Ks. This is going to be someone who's ramping. This is going to be somebody who is not performing over a given week. And I just want to use this as an example. Someone like this would only be hitting the base because they would be likely in this like 9%. So that's like $900. But for us, draw base is going to no matter what give them base. And I didn't actually fully explain this well enough. So draw base right here, meaning that as soon as they pass this base, the commission just fully takes over. It's not in addition. It's on top of. Okay? Or I'm sorry. Yeah, it's not in addition, it's in replacement of. So as soon as someone gets to $1,700, so they've sold 17,000 at 10%, call it that. Uh it now is the full amount. So now they're at 1,700. Then the next sale they're at uh they're at 2,200 and they climb. But it's not in addition to this. All right. So there's a little bit of security there for the sales rep in that way. A little bit of a burden as the company because if they're under that, you're still paying base no matter what. But it offers a nice incentivized to not go too out of pocket as a company. And then $0 bonus because they didn't hit any of these thresholds. And then in total, it's just that base amount. All right. So that's kind of general gist. Uh in addition to that, oops, in addition to that on here, we will do random contests. So sales manager is awesome. So for us, so we had a little over a million in cash collected before he got there. Had dipped down and then when he took over, we had scaled to like three I think in new at that time and had done like 3.8 cuz we did internal at that time too, like a big internal uh special at the time to do renewals at 5K. But he'll do random contests. He'll do I'm buying someone steak this week tonight. Whoever gets the most uh random week ones. Right now we have a there's an event that's coming up like a conference and uh he set it up so whoever closes x amount of units and like top three get to go to this contest and the company will pay for it. So the company has XYZ burden but it's overtaken by um the contest and the like how much more they perform across that. So just fun random contests. Now these are two fun ones. So net new cash 30-day. So, what I mean by that is I kind of explained up here, but net new or net meaning that if there's a refund that occurs from that first 30 days, it is clawed back. Um, and that's how this entire thing is based. So, it's like super critical for us because you'll have sales reps that'll get people just like over the line and they won't even sign the terms on the next page or like we we try and do it on the call but they'll be like, "Oh, I can't or whatever." Or they sign the terms and then instantly contact support and are like, "I just got bullied. I just did whatever." And like we've had all the I mean we've done I don't even know how many 100,000 sales calls, probably more. I could look, but um just like crazy. So, that's going to happen. You're going to have reps that do that. You're going to have reps that do that for a little bit of time. You're going to have reps that are just like that. Um and for us, it's very important that we claw back on that because we don't need to go more out of pocket than we are. And then this PIFF 30-day, the fun little like secret sauce piece. So, our reps are fantastic at this. I can't even tell you the actual like formalized process because I'm not close enough to um to the sales reps in this way, but we have it set so they get paid on anything that happens in the first 30 days. So if someone uses a payment plan and checks out for $3,600 payment plan. So it's I think that's two pays plus something else or like a $2,100 pay plan. If they up any of that amount to basically PIFF within the first 30 days, we pay the sales rep. So the sales rep will follow up and go back and forth and the coaching obviously like can do it as well or CS but anybody in that sphere will push them will will be like you know are you enjoy the program so far? Do you want to save on future payments? Do you want XYZ? And then we'll get them to pay off their full balance where they can get the $7,200 pricing which is only if you piff in the beginning if they do it up with if in that first 30 days. So, you're going to have someone who then just pays the other $3,600 balance or someone who did $2,100 who then pays a $5,100 balance within the first 31 days or in the first 30 days and the sales reps get commission for that. So, we have a really good actual review of this. Like sometimes I'll be like, "Oh, look at all these new units coming in today." And it's all just our billing manager running them that from submitted. So, that is the general gist of how we do it. Um, in the past, we just had it as percentages. For the longest time, we were 1099 only. So, when we were doing I mean, we had to have done 50 to 60 million probably through this funnel before we actually moved everyone to W2 on the sales rep side of things. Um, just because we want to standardize things more and like legally you should if you're doing all these standardizations and like force meetings and all that. Um, so that is one of the reasons we moved everyone over and for future exit. Um, but I I've heard of a ton of ways to do this. Uh, a lot of the people say that base should be basically half. Uh I hear stuff where a base becomes less than half at scale. Obviously it should. Uh another really good one that I recently heard is unit based. So I don't want to dox who said this, but unit based. So where basically if you're at and you have to know your company and your numbers, but call it uh for the first 10 units, then uh call it 10 to 15 units and then 15 units plus. They will do it unit based across the whatever period. So either a two week or a monthly or something in that range to where if they get 10 units this is like 6%. This is 8%. And or even lower honestly I've heard of it like this. So like this is crazy competitive. So like if you're in this range you it's very hard to make like a large income like multiple hundreds of thousands. So you have to be in this range. Um, and then I've heard even crazier ones, but like basically this idea that you have this lower amount and then you have this like big jump. So everyone is just hardressed to get units. So it's like how can I do better follow-up? How can I do all this? So like I said, I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. In current state, our sales team is not performing in like the best way that it could. And that is a many many multitude issue of show rates of quality for marketing. Um of the actual like team and the vibe um the structure and how we have it all set up. The count of bookings and expectations of how many bookings or hours they work and then marry that with how many show rates and stuff like that. So you could have someone who only accepts 50 bookings a week which could seem high but that's for us 30 minutes. That's 25 hours there. You would have 5 hours of meetings if you do an hour meeting a day. you have all the admin stuff, so maybe five there maybe. Um, and like even then you're at you have 50% of those that show. So like the math gets all kind of wonky around and we're still trying to solve for this. Um, but we have had success in many ways when at 1099 and then we had some while we were at W2 and right now it's kind of like turnaround season and we are roughly in that range of like 10%. Um, because show rates are down because close rates are down. So, we're optimizing for that. And I've made other videos on this, but we're optimizing for it with uh low ticket because we've never done low ticket. So, instead of having a lead book on the call, we're optimizing for it uh instead of a lead booking on a call, we're having buyers book on a call. Um so, you're going to have low ticket buyers instead of leads. We're going to use setters for both funnels. So, for low ticket, it's basically going to be like implementation call to a closer. And then we're also going to do it uh everywhere of like the the main lanes of the VSSL. So, think like people who apply but don't book, 50% of those people drop off. So calling those and we already have stuff like email and AI and all that but like actually dialing these uh no show and cancel huge lift potential. Um, if 40% of your calls, 50% of your calls no show and cancel, instant dialing when they actually submit it or if they reach out and say that, um, try and find a lift there. Cuz if you recapture 10 of those a day on both fronts, so-called 20, and you have a 10 to 15% sales per booking, like you just got two to four units a day, which in our case is 20 grand, 25 grand. Uh, so yeah, it stacks up when you start to get these little percents and spots, but this is what we're currently operating on. Um, so I just want to share where we're at with that and I will 100% update as we go. And again, as always, DM on Instagram is the best place if you want to communicate and comment with any questions or things you want me to talk about because I'm just shooting these raw. So, let me know.

# we made $30M last year. here is how we planned it | E12
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQe1U2iFnuM

what's up everybody all right so today we're going to go into the quarterly meeting agenda that we use at our company that did 30 million in cash collected last year whole point of this channel is me just sharing what we're doing what we have done before and how we are operating to scale to 100 million a year in cash collected so let's get into it um all right so first things first attendees so I we actually operate this entire thing out of a clickup board um that's like the different meetings then they can all get uh queued into there and connect to each other and have like shared but for this I'm just going to use a Google doc so first things first attendees all right so for us it's going to be our CEO chief of people customer success sales director senior Tech lead Chief technology operating this is technically me we don't have a defined one for this yet which is kind of funny but uh Chief marketing and outbound director all right so I'm going to facilitate it and let me just show you on the org chart that I made I made this specifically for these again this is our active one but so essentially CMO who's going to lead all of this Chief Tech is currently me and I kind of sit more right here but that's its own thing uh senior Tech lead because he is a rockstar and is going to lead all of Tech into the future sales director is currently our closure manager as well like acts as both so this outbound director is actually this Setter manager same thing um and outbound director uh they're basically both like sitting here so they're both in operational decisions and customer success manager and chief of people they are too so the goal being that these right here that are kind of like in an or chart sense uh like a second layer down actually are going to more or less be operating their own Department okay so this currently does report to here but because it has such a standalone um like division same with Setter has their whole own Standalone closer their own Standalone and then Tech eventually these will fully R run their own department and for us the whole point of Ops is like that's why I kind of joke that this is like my current role is basically just facilitating them because we have such strong leaders that they fully run their own department so to have like a COO title or whatever ever I mean we can put whatever we want on it but basically as long as us as a team are deciding at the operational level what we need to get done the kpis the quarterly goals like backing into all that stuff and are reporting essentially to each other in that meeting they do have a direct report right we do still all go up to CEO in some capacity like on one to ones um but for the sake of actually making decisions and then executing on them these are all extremely strong leaders that can do that that can already do that within their division and don't need like too much handholding so that's a general gist of who is going to be on it and again I will facilitate it so this is a blend of a few things like mainly this is on the EOS framework um it's kind of like a hybrid is of that not because I think we can do it better just because how we're currently operating necessarily isn't ready for full EOS um and then another person who has a really good video what's his name um Ravi avula made a really good video about this and his is actually super similar to ours uh and we I I just uh put this in here from him because we used to have this up higher on ours um but we've always done this and then the org chart one is new to us already and then we've always used these so here's the general agenda um but go check out his channel his stuff fantastic so personal wins and setting expectations um so we already do this and uh all of our other meetings so we have an operations meeting that's already on weekly Cadence and what we do is right now it's March 24th 2025 so this meeting is tomorrow on our normal Tuesday Ops meeting except we make it an hour and a half or two hours depending and then it's for the coming quarter so this is for starting in April the Q2 okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do the personal wins basically just break the ice everyone talk about what amazing things happened in their life and then I will set the expectations of the meeting okay so I've already set this out and I'll send you the pre I'll I'll put the pre in here and we can go over that but I've sent this out to the team so these two have never been in operations yet on our operations meeting in terms of our actual like the channel um or in obviously any of the quarterly stuff so what we're going to do or on any of the meetings so tomorrow will be their first meeting then from then will include them in uh in our operations Channel which is where all like bigger decisions are made and conversation is um and then they will also now be on the weekly Cadence for all operations meetings going forward so thus far it's just been this and if you scale way back it was like you know basically two of us three of us and then it has scaled to this but now we're adding these two okay and both of them are just like unbelievable at their jobs in their role and come with experience which is amazing so personal wins and setting expectations um once we're there we're going to go into this kind of because of the these guys are new on the team so Luke's going to do uh or CEO is going to do where we've been and where we're going so we were doing 10 million two years ago last year we did 30 million 3x we broke everything here's what happened and our next goal is direct response heavy low ticket fully optimized sales system and over 100 million right like that type of gist but for 10 minutes going through all of that and I have this whole thing slotted out with like how much time and my job is to facilitate and make sure that stays on that okay review values and Mission um Ravi on his video had a good point of updating these and uh in this meeting for us with kind of who's on the team right now and the current state like these are pretty solid for us they're already relatively freshly updated um so we're going to keep these as is for now so this is just going to be reviews make sure that everyone again is up to speed knows where we stand know what is important to us and where we're going in the mission uh q1 data this is all me so this is I have live dashboards that I wish I could show you but I just again too much like privacy information on them but the q1 data is going to be for us specific too we have like an overall company one that goes all the way down to profit um that we'll be sharing so like where we at this month where we at quarter to date uh in comparison to last year in compar like across all these ranges um and then same thing with sales and marketing data because those are kind of like the big pillar ones uh we do use a weekly scorecard and I can go into the weekly Cadence we have later but we use a weekly scorecard that has important metrics for every basically Department of this so like for tech for example it's like how many custo or uh support tickets occurred like internal support tickets so where things could could be automated where there opportunities what was the percentage error rate of our AI system that we use for SMS um on sales it'll be like units bookings all that CS how many escalations like uh you know almost refunds or like requested refunds and then how many actually turned into refunds or not uh or cancellations so stuff like that um but for this one it's a little bit broader stroke like entire company q1 data and really focus on like cash right cash in cash out and then the metrics across uh not as much the operational data all right then review and update the or chart I just kind of showed you a v probably 13 of this but this one and I'll have an update on that um because we're kind of basically trying to determine some of the sales piece uh me honestly and then kind of where this flows and then what else the CMO will need and what the timeline is for that um this Department's already pretty good it just Grows by units so that is that and then Rock review and creation so for us what we do again this is eos model you can look I think it's a Gino Wickman traction um but essentially Rocks Our quarterly goals simply put so we already have our q1's so we're going to review these pretty quick but again because these two weren't here they don't have anything for that yet so they're just listening and just getting up to date and getting to where we are um and then creation of them so this like basically the biggest portion of the meeting for us um a lot of people do this section but for us in this specific meeting we're going to do a big portion here so I already have numbers in mind and already have them pre-written for what I think our targets are in terms of like cash collected Target for Q2 uh in terms of row as Target on new row as uh retention metric like these different pieces I already have slotted so I want to come together with a team and have them come to those understanding and pick the numbers together that what they think is realistic and then back into it so let's say it's 3 million a month right so if our unit is XYZ like let's just say so for 3 million back into it how many new units is that that's 400 new units a month okay so 400 new units if you're selling a 10% sales per booking is 4,000 book calls if you have 4,000 book calls marketing needs what $200 a booking so you're going to spend 800 Grand in ads but like backing into all of those and then making it so it's realistic for them across the quarter so that was a monthly example um but we'll break those down and then same things with the actual projects that occur so the goal being we come to with the actual metrics more so already in mind and then it's one of the actual projects and one of the pieces that need to get done and then assigned out to to divisions which are essentially people um and departments on what they will handle so um I'll break that down in the pre-meeting section but so that is the biggest piece of this and then IDs this is like a rolling never ending list it's like a parking lot thing a lot of people overuse that but it's uh I guess I'll included but it is just like constant idea generation that goes into a massive list things that need to be uh they've already been identified we're then going to discuss them and solve and assign out so they sit in this just like bucket of open on clickup is what we use um then we talk about them and they get moved into to-do with who submitted it uh who is like the champion of it and then any other details get included in the clickup uh task and then uh get assigned out like a due date essentially so they'll pop into to-do then then go to in progress and complete so everything from let's run a new internal review campaign because that'll feed this and the whole goal whole goal is it is a waterfall so you're going to have your annuals which we already have but like because of how we're shifting things it's kind of like we're already kind of adjusting our annual goals just after q1 and the changes we had and who we're deciding to hire and how we're deciding to transition the company so this is like a really key meeting for us because of everything that's going to change in Q2 three and four so for Q2 we will then look and say okay what else needs to happen in here um so like I said the reviews one for example um let's say for Setters it's 30% of Revenue we want to come from Setters like what needs to happen there where can we Implement AI in Tech um so pieces there now pre- meeting and we're kind of talking about what already happens here so I just want to jump to this so for pre-meeting this is what we sent out oops so prepare to talk about updates from your rocks for q1 this is what they basically need to come with and they saw this whole thing already um so it's prepare to talk about updates on your rocks from q1 so essentially just this part of the team already has their rocks and each one has three to five maybe of their quarterly goals so were they complete were they not we talk about this every week in the monthly update so we already kind of know them so this part's pretty quick and then it's which one of them either need to get carried forward or canceled so if something didn't get it's either it's completed it needs to get carried forward into Q2 because it didn't and why didn't it because it should have been right most of the time unless there's some sort of block and then um uh completely canceled in some way right so different things change we don't need a whatever new accounting system or something right now because it's just not priority and we're just going to cancel it for now and revisit later and then this is the big piece so having everyone ready everyone including all the new team uh to go through Rock review and creation and I just gave some examples so we want everyone to come with two to five specific Department specific goals for Q2 so for marketing let's say it's a blended net CPA of 1500 right because now we're running low ticket so there's like a net aspect where we can offset it with uh liquidation uh using low ticket items uh like I said earlier 30% new rev from Setter claimed okay what needs to happen there and these are already going to be talked about at the broader scope and then broken down into the different individuals but this is more so the non-broken down Parts I guess is an easy way to say it so like this for example source of Truth data migrated for Tech we want to move all of our Tech stack completely inside one source of Truth uh right now we're planning on using HubSpot to where we use all the custom tables and databases and things inside there because it exists in a multitude of places everything works great and is like scalable but like you have to go too many places to look for things you can't query things against each other without combining them in other places so where is this really going to fall in we want to do 3 million a month and we want to do this we want to do this and like in calls and rowes it's not but like it's still important for the company and in a different way right so hopefully that's the goal of Tomorrow is to come up with all these and then same thing with this like 10 reviews weekly Evergreen okay so like how do we get 10 reviews a week how do we do that in through an evergreen system we'll just throw this on here and then customer success can back into okay where are the places I can get it I can get it from uh email signatures I can get it from uh client requests I can get it from MPS score or MPS requests like all these different places and then they can handle that outside of the meeting okay but as a team we're going to decide these so this is a general gist it'll about an hour and a half um and I can report back kind of how it goes this is our first one with this crew um the last one we did was an annual planning meeting where it was a full day where everybody here uh basically came with like a their strengths their weaknesses the company because of them like what parts of them are thriving the company and not what their goals are at an annual basis and we did that in person and that was really good but for these quarterly ones we just do them over Zoom so I will update you on how this goes and again I got a ton of uh inspiration on this from EOS initially and then I added a couple pieces from Ravi that was on there um this is basically the format that we've always ran them and that's it so drop any comments comment um or DM on Instagram if you have any questions or want any topics specific and we'll talk soon soon

# Calendly + Jotform Made Us $70M. here is how | E11
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFef7AGgeX0

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through how we use application routing to keep our calendars as booked as possible all the time. All right, so this is the exact funnel that we used to do 30 million in cash collected last year, 70 million in total cash collected on this funnel. All right, so this channel is just me sharing what we've tried, what we're currently doing, uh how we're changing things to get to 100 million a year in cash collected and just documenting it along the way. All right, so let's get into it. So this application is actually V2. So, this is the 13th question here, but so for the first application we had, we did like 250,000 to 300,000 applications through and it had free form, no financial qualifier. Um, and clearly it worked, but this one is just a cleaner one that has a higher completion rate and uh also we introduced an financial qualifier. So, this is just what we're doing now, but clearly the other worked as well. So for this this is I was just laughing when I read this like the there's no punctuation things like goes to show don't have to be perfect but uh on my journey to get healthy come fit and toned I've already invested and the framing of this is obviously to show what they already have invested not some like make money online right we're in uh women's fitness so 40 to 60 so we're not asking like how much money they have to invest in themsel like all of that it's just the framing is weird so for this it's how much have they already invested in themselves now based on the data of what we've collected So far, quick numbers on this is this is about half the conversion rate of these. Okay, so call this 5%. Like app to uh close or technically booking to close through app, but uh these are like 10. All right, and this is five. Just quick, we're just going to use those numbers. So saying that, now what do you want to do with these less than one case? They still close, but way less. So the goal is to get as many of these as possible. Now what are we going to do with that? So we have conditional formatting on the back. And there are people who do this like crazy lead scoring and goes across all the different questions and if they're in these buckets, push them to these pockets. Like this is just what we do very simply in two directions. And then I'm going to show you how we like ninja automate it. So it just keeps calendars booked no matter what. Um but for us what we have on the back end is the uh conditional routing. So right now because we have so many bookings and like so many quality bookings directly coming through um we actually sorry that's bright. Um we have it set fully to DQ. So, a DQ full page for us is this. It's basically like, "Hey, Mandy," which is our AI, is going to reach out to you uh with a couple more questions, but in the meantime, buy this low ticket. Okay? So, just trying to push them into here. And this cleans up sales like all day, every day. So, just this ugly page. We're completely rebuilding this. And this is what March 2025. So, this is going to go live uh in like another week. We're going to completely rebuild this. Um but they will get DQed fully if this is toggled. Okay. The other option is to just run them through to a DQ booking page that's identical to the other booking page with a booking except this booking widget is going to be a completely different one. So we don't have setters. We now do and we're like rolling that out this week but this whole time we haven't. So what we technically have is on the back end we have two calendarlys. You have the master that has the high quality bookings getting to it basically only and then you have this which is the DQ one. So we'll do routing or availability um priorities for the sales reps based on that. So like your top one will have all of your top closers in it and then in order and then it'll have the bottom one which is the DQ one all of your like second and then uh down to your worst closers in current state or new onboarding for example. So that's how we currently run it when we have this on. Right now we have so many bookings that are coming in as quality because marketing is crushing it that we have this fully off. Now, where this all came from, what I'm about to show you is when you have like just enough or you're scaling your sales team but like not enough and you're kind of in that like waffling in between phase where you can't fully book out with only your quality bookings. All right, so quick math on this. Let's say you have 200 applications coming through a day and based on your data over the last week, you know that on average 50 of those bookings are quality are the 1k plus people and use whatever your example is for yours. Of those 100 then that are coming through is 50/50. Okay, a 100 of them are quality 55% app to booking rate. So you only get 55 bookings a day, but you need to fill 100 100 for your calendar to be full. for example, how are you going to let these ones through from the bottom barrel just enough to fill the calendars? Because sales reps thrive on back to back, right? Because you're going to have no shows, you're going to have all that. You have enough of those strung in a row, you get strung up in a row, you get like completely out of flow and the sales percent overall sales per booking goes down. Like it's best to be busy even if it's a little bit lower quality. And again, we're trying everything to make it so and everyone is as quality. And again, the 1% still close or the less than 1K still closed, just at a lower percentage. All right, so How we built this out is this right here. So essentially, if this field hidden field that we're just calling spots is less than 61, okay, route them to the next steps. Okay, so if it's less than 61, route them there. And it's and it's equal to this. If it's above 60, so right, it kind of just I think it's whatever. It's just because it wouldn't do greater than or equal to 60 then and equal to this, then route them to the DQ page. So you fundamentally think what that is saying, it's saying if the spots, that's this hidden field that's buried in this application spots right here. Right now it's 53. So if it says it's 53, that means it's going to route them all to DQ because it's less than. If it was over 53 or I mean sorry, if it was over 60, it would open them up to the DQ booking page. Okay, so difference there. Why we do this and how we do this. So back to this, I made another video on this on how to have a spot tracker. So, this is how many open spots are on your sales team calendar like into the future. So, today being the 23rd. All right, this one's not live now, but as an example, so 85 open spots are for today and 116 are for tomorrow. Not good because let's say you have uhund or you only have like 50 on bookings on day. It's like you still have a massive amount of calls to fill. So you want that toggle to have as many as possible. But then when you start to get full and you're at a hundred over here, you only want to let the ones squeeze through that are quality because you're trying to fill it with as much quality and you almost want the DQ ones to just back fill. Okay? Or just basically get it to the wa get the water up to the line of where yes, you know, you're going to be able to fill with quality now only is kind of more of the methodology. So, how I have this set up is inside the job form, we're going to have a hidden field that's here that is just going to be called spots. And the reason we do that is because when the form does its conditional logic, you want it to be able to route based on something that occurred in the application. So, people do this with UTMs all the time. Um, you can easily do this like I shared right here with normal routing just directly. It's like if it's this, it's this. If it's this, it's this. But I needed dynamically changing based on how much open spot availability we had. All right. So what I did is if we have every hour it's going to take today's date, reformat that date, and then it's going to look up tomorrow's amount of open spots and based on this or this, it's going to then set that predefined value inside the jot form. So, it's going to go in, it's going to push in, it's going to edit the form itself and change the default value of this, the default value to 53. All right. To right now, it would set it to 116. Okay? So, it's going to find tomorrow's amount and if it's whatever number, it's going to push it in there. And then you can choose based on where your throttle is based on what you know. Okay? So, might be a little confusing, but let me try and rephrase it. So, if tomorrow has 50 spots available, that means that it's currently 8:00 p.m., so it only has 50 spots available tomorrow. We know based on our numbers that we're going to be able to get that many bookings by then. Okay? So, we know that we're going to be able to get 50 bookings to fill in of quality, right? So, we're going to toggle it off. Now, if we have 116 like it was, that's like, oh man, that's too many bookings. We're not going to be able to fill people's calendars. They're going to have open spots. They're going to have no shows that are going to fit between. People are going to have two hours in the middle of the day where they have nothing to do as a sales rep. So, what we're going to do is we're going to let all of them through. We're going to let all the DQ ones and all the main ones run. And it's going to continue to run until we have enough bookings. Then, it's going to toggle itself automatically instead of having a VA or you or someone in there actively managing it to change that. So, like right now, we use 60 because we can generate so many. uh for a while we had it at 40. So only when there was 40 available so we would have more DQ bookings on the calendar until it trained. Now, level two of this, and I can I can't show these because you have like API keys and stuff in them, but just is every hour find the date, find tomorrow's date, look it up in that sheet, find the open spot number, and push the open spot number as a default value into this so that that number is live updating every hour and submitted with every jot. And then when it finally hits the threshold and it's submitted, it'll route it. Okay? So, people do crazy lead scoring that we don't do. that's like if they answer this one and this one and this one. We passed our stuff off to a data scientist on like 250,000 applications and all like 15,000 customers and all this stuff and they found like nothing. And for us it was like if they're obese already and again women's fitness 40 60 if they're already obese and if they tried macronutrients which is like part of our methodology and they tried macronutri macronutrients in the past and they didn't work for them. If either of those two it was like lower but again that was on the old app. This is before GPT cuz now we fed it in our new CMO who's a rockstar. Shout out news. Uh he found all this information and found like a bunch of pockets of stuff that are really cool that the data scientist that we paid dumb amount of money didn't do or didn't find. So we may be tweaking this, but this is just kind of like the technical part of the routing. The other piece of this that's super important is the DQ page. This for the booking right now still goes to our closers. Okay, it just goes to the the lower bucket of closers. very easily. You can just swap this out and go to your setters, which is the next plan for us after we get to the point of uh using the setters on the other lanes that are coming through and missing opportunity. So, this will go through setters and a couple other places will. But where I want to go is the big piece of this page is it does not fire anything on Facebook. Okay? So, it does not fire the pixels, Google or Facebook or Meta more so. All right? And why that's huge is because for us, you're going to have the lead event, you're going to have the submit application, the uh schedule, and the purchase. All native events. All right? And this is 6 months old or so for us because we used custom conversions and all stuff for a while. The DQs, the 1K sub, even if you're letting them through, do not fire the pixel on server or browser. So, it's not on page and it doesn't do that. And then because it's another widget, so whether you're using Hyros or UTM or like any of these, you can just set it. So these bookings do not count towards a pixel. All right? So if you have 200 applications that come, we don't even fire an application because this would be a submit app technically. So you're going to have every lead firing, call it 1,000 leads, you're going to get 200 applications. It' be higher, but you know what I mean. 200 applications. Half of those, let's call them DQ, are going to land on this page. Now, the other hundred are quality bookings and are going to land on the actual quality booking page that has the better uh closers on it. Those are going to fire submit applications. The DQ ones are not. Then the bookings that come through the main are going to fire schedules. The DQ ones are not. All right? So, we're only feeding back to Facebook the ones that are double the conversion rate. Okay? And that is just the goal of that. and we haven't like fully shaken it out yet, but the goal of that is to make the submit app, the schedule, as well as obviously the purchase. The purchase is the highest, but it's such a long cycle that we're trying to optimize earlier in the funnel and this is how we're trying to do it. So, that's the gist on like the routing. Uh, again, we've had crazy looks at this and different models and stuff built out on the application data and this is what we using so far. We may go back and I'll update you on that on how we do and same thing with the setters. setters are going to squeeze this and make it like super super helpful. Um, but this is just how we do automatic routing to make sure the calendars are always full by keeping it dynamic so that you can allow bookings but maybe to a lower quality bucket or you can allow bookings but you don't uh cook the pixel on the bad people or on the lower quality people. And yeah, so comment below what you want me to talk about because I have a million one things on a sheet that I can just riff on like this like any day. Um, but yeah, something that'll be valuable to you guys. And then yeah, chat on Instagram and subscribe, comment on here so I can get some more ideas. And I'll talk to you guys soon.

# The Review Strategy That Generated $70M in Cash Collected
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSmTLA940cY

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go into getting and using reviews to scale your business. We did 30 million in cash collected last year and the goal of this channel is for me to show what we're doing now, where we have failed, where we are growing, and how we are getting to 100 million a year in cash collected. All right, so what I'm going to go into today is the difference between the internal and the external reviews, how we get them, and what we do with them. Okay. So, to start internal, we have onboarding feedback, 30-day feedback, 90-day post activity. I'll go into this random feedback and email signature stuff. All right. So, this is basically what we collect and how we collect. See, they're both very similar because they're specific to the actual piece that they are triggered on as well as the feedback to them. Okay. So, onboarding, this can be used for like any business. The example of this is for our coaching business, online coaching. Um so onboarding is with the CS rep that happens right after someone purchases. Okay. So when that's complete email sent and it's also prompted in SMS for them to rate and review the different pieces of the onboarding that has occurred. Okay. So why we collect that is so you can rank and so you can uh gather feedback on how those calls can be better and how they can be better suited for the customer, right? And just overall feedback. These are evergreen as well as are a lot of these. meaning that as long as you're onboarding new people, as long as there's a new customer inflow, you're constantly going to be getting this feedback and you can adjust the questions and you can tailor it and continue to um gather that feedback over time without having to do pushes and just random like launches, all that. It just consistently comes through. So, same thing with 30-day. This is going to be for fulfillment specific. So, this is going to be uh for in our case the coaches and how we get that feedback. Now, important on 30 and 90 for these we use MPS. And when we use NPS, when it is a nine or above, we push them after to uh basically review us on external sites, which I'll go into in the bottom portion. Um, but overall, you're just gathering all the super super valuable feedback. And then we also collect a like a KPI dashboard for the coaches and the fulfillment to be able to rank who gets the highest, why do they get the highest, what are the soft metrics, what are the hard metrics. Uh, back in like now that we have GPT, you can seriously just dump all these into a spreadsheet, put them into GPT, and be like, what are the common keywords? What are the common uh phrases people use? Uh what is the coach that comes up the most? Right? Like these different pieces that are super super valuable that would take a lot of work before don't take any work now at all. Post activity. Um I say evergreen on this but it's kind of like this portion is not evergreen but the process is so postactivity meaning like any type of conversion event any type of uh what's a good example? So like if you have a coaching call cadence for group coaching. So every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, uh you have coaching calls or one or whatever, Monday, Tuesday, Friday. So you have these different coaching calls after that you have it set up so that the attendees of it get feedback. So it's evergreen in the way that it's automated, but there's specific events that actually occur. Or another better example is when you have an external speaker come in and speak to your community, right? So that might not be happening all the time, but you want an automated way of feedback to know is that the same type of speaker we want? where do people get value or not? Uh based on that, is there somewhere else that we can offer better things to our customers that'll allow us to get higher LTV and you know get a better result for the client, right? Stuff like that. So I do call that um post activity, but it also kind of fits into this random feedback bucket which is sometimes marketing will want something and they'll be like okay what is the best pool you have is your customers for the feedback obviously, right? So we will say marketing wants to know what did you see in the ad that stuck out to you? What's your favorite part about this? uh from where you started to where you are. what was the biggest evolution or thing that you felt right and like ask these like proddding like good questions and then we can use those same way drop in GPT or just looking across the sheet and be like okay a lot of them are saying they became more empowered right so like that word specific or that uh macronutrients pops up a lot or that um the transformation they felt or their home life or like these different pieces that then you can pull back and bring to the front of the funnel that then carries across because if these are your best customers and these are what they're saying why wouldn't you layer it in to bring those same type of people in, right? So, this is huge for us. Uh we do collect it on the front end as best we can like in application and all that, but you just once someone's a customer and they're in it, they can sometimes give better feedback to their current process. Um but it's a little bit harder for them to remember maybe like, oh, I saw it on Facebook or YouTube or oh, this is how I felt, you know, when I was sitting on my couch when I clicked it. So, and the last one is evergreen uh email signature. So, this is basically just wherever your main email is. So like support at company name. Um I'm trying to remember where I heard this recent but um we're rolling this out right now actually. So this is real time but we've never had this. So basically ranking your email support. So like how did we do one to five and then if it's only if it's five it routes to the external ones. So that's amazing. Can you leave a review for us here? If it's one to four it's an internal feedback form. So same thing you gather super important customer feedback. There's an extremely high volume of emails and CS so we can get a ton of feedback and then it also gives us the opportunity to get more evergreen reviews. Okay, external. This is the fun one. This is why everyone should be here and what you do. So, for what we collect, we have a URL that is basically just wordbay.com/review. And these are the core places that we want to collect them. So, BBB, Trustpilot, Facebook, Google, and an actual testimonial. All right. So, let me carry these over here and talk through them all. All right. So, BBB. So, this is all going to be specific to your customer demo and where they exist, right? So, BBB is pretty well known for basically all online businesses. Um, it's very specific for us. It is it it is a big needle mover in our market because 40 to 60 year old is our target and they use stuff like this, right? They look in places like this. So, BBB was a big one for us to push and make sure we get them. Uh, I'm going to go into how we collect, which is like the true sauce here. Um, but I just want to go through all these pieces just to give context. Trust pilot. this has become more and more important and they are like breaking away as kind of one of the core places to collect reviews and have them all centralized. Um, it's kind of painful honestly to like collect them and do it and they make you try and pay like $500 a month and we do our best to do our way without having to do like all their automated widgets and all that. Um, Trustpilot is huge. Facebook, that's the actual Facebook pages. So, the company page and the pages that you run ads from. Google just like a Google My Business setup just because they sometimes it'll rank in different ways and it's just good to have presence there. And then these these are these are the absolute gold. So video review what we use is testimonial. Oops, I'm sorry. We use testimonial.to and then you set it up so that all of these that when they record them, they are in the same format. So it's basically like a template here. the videos record in the same way and uh they're all following that same template and it's a super super good like auto automated way to collect for video reviews. Now where we use the video reviews mainly is on uh our site we have like a success tab and we collect them into here. This page has a 2x conversion of this page to get people to the next CTA. So video reviews right here just a constant stream of different ones that are in the demo, right? So 40 to 60 year old women that are in the demo and we collected all of these through that testimonial. Okay, so that's a huge one. And then customer interview, that's like the creme de creme. That is when you find people that have the best reviews. You find people uh that left the best review on a Trust pilot or gave the best uh testimonial. Um then you can introduce them to oh do you want to get on a call with the expert, the coach, the business owner, the whoever. And that's where we do these. So these are mid to long form and these are built for consumption. So the goal being that someone is consuming these before getting on the phone so that they have just more brand connection, more brand awareness, have consumed more information. Uh and then also these are just stellar. These are women who came in who weren't getting XYZ result who were stuck and then got to their desired result and are like absolute brand allstars. They just love it. Okay, so this is super super valuable to do both of these and they both have their place. All right, so for video reviews and customer interviews, video reviews um and then some of these also on Trust Pilot we use in a ton of the marketing. So emailing out um so like anytime someone think something makes the site, we're emailing to it uh to the lists that are like, oh hey, new video interview, new customer success interview. Um video reviews, these are using a bunch of ads. So like UGC style, these are clipped together or either standalone and are run as ads. And this just fuels the business. It's just like this flywheel of like more customers come in, happy success. If you have the thing set up to collect information and reviews, then pushing that all the way back to marketing and just constant feedback loop. And then, you know, all these guys say it's like if you have a good enough product, you don't even need marketing. And we still do need marketing. Uh because, you know, we don't have all this referral traffic that can keep us to the pace that we're at. Um but funneling these people back in into the front end is like gold. Like you get multiples on Lyft. And then same thing with consumption. you have more people consuming content of people that are like them that were in the situation that they were in and or they are in and they want to get to, right? So, it's like just that classic loop. All right. Now, how we collect this is the favorite part. So, how we collect um or how we have in the past. So, upgrade a product. So, what this means, we actually stole this from Sam Ovens back in the day. So he had consulting uh I want to say it was uplevel maybe it was accelerator but he basically made like an updated version that he was going to launch and that's what he was going to uh sell starting tomorrow right so we've done this where we used to sell an info product where we created a 2.0 version when as soon as the 2.0 version's live all of your new customers that you're talking to on the phone are buying and only getting in 2.0. Okay, you have 10,000 customers that are sitting in the first one. Now, you can either oh for you know 20% of the price or whatever you can upgrade for full price you can upgrade or it's valuable enough for you. It's just a login access. There's no cost to it. So easily you can just say I will give you access to this if you give us a review, right? So what we do is we send them to this page and say do as many of these as like possible. Do at least three of these. Do whatever. Um and these are the core ones for us. So we're like we need a video submitted review and then we need one of these. All right. And generally it's Trustpilot, it's a testimonial and then like one of these other ones. Okay. The core ones. And each one is specific. And I'll kind of get into that. So upgrade product was a huge one back in the day. And that's how we got a lot of the initial testimonials. And it was for an other product, an older product. You won't see those on the site because we have like high hundreds I think maybe even over a thousand actual like video testimonial reviews. Um but they're like different products and different pieces. Um, that might be a little high, but I I can look exactly, but we have a ton of them. Um, so now we've been very selective and we have only the fresh ones, only the ones in the age bracket, only the ones specific for this product and offering just to double down on making sure that it's in alignment. Swag discount code. We have a shop front that is basically just branded swag. Uh, it took us forever to get it going, but now that we have it, um, a lot of them want to rep it. So, we will give pretty steep discounts. Just basically just cover our cost is the whole goal of that. It's not a money maker. It never will be. you won't be a needle mover. Um, so we just do a discount code and we'll push it out to the community randomly. Um, and that's also included in the uh footer of some of the emails on the way in. So to get swag as well as like get reviews if you want to use a discount. Okay, four months free. This is a push, excuse me. Um, so the goal here is run a contest basically to get as many reviews as humanly possible. Okay, so we did a launch that was I think two weeks long inside of our community and it doesn't even need to be that long depending on how active and like how much of time it takes to reach your customers um or like to have the engagement. And basically we were like for us, let's say it costs $1,000 to fulfill on your product. If it's an info product, uh it's a little difficult, but you need something else that you can give them. So for us, it's a recurring product where we can say we can add four months to your membership if you win this contest. And to enter the contest, you just need to submit a ton of reviews. So, our offer was you get four months added to your membership for free if you submit all these and we're going to do a raffle or like we're going to draw one, whatever that's called. Okay. So, we got likeund and something reviews. So, we had just launched on Trust Pilot and we got like 115 in a week that came in that were all legit organic through and through. Um, so that was a really good one for us. And again, for our cost, if it's $1,000 to have a coach for a year, whatever it is, that's $400. You're going to pay $400 to do to getundred and something that's $4. Um, another I just saw Mosie post about this too. So, he has insanely good content on acquisition.com. He has an email list that he sends out like mosy minutes and he talked about doing this with swag. So, like kind of a a combination of those two where you ordered hundreds of t-shirts and they were specifically only for people who left reviews. So, you just like couldn't even buy it. The only way you could get it is if you left reviews on all three things, you got a swag. You got some swag. So, a version of that. Credit to him in that way. Um, but we have been running this for a minute. Uh, these random push. So, we're we do this one every 3 to 6 months where we do a push for free uh or for an extended membership. That's a big one. The newest one, and this is kind of like a flip of it, is compensating the coaches and having competition. So, this is currently active for us now in March of 2025. We have a coach competition that's like 10 days long where we came up with dollar values that we were willing to give. So, let's say it's $1,000, 500, and 250 for the top three places. And it's who can get the most reviews from their current clientele. So every coach will have 50 75 you know onboarding ones 20 30 uh active clients. Now how many can you get submitted and then whoever wins it over that 10day range gets the first second third place. Okay. And this one right now we're like a day or two in and already has 50 something just on Trust Pilot. And then the reviews are following the video reviews are following. And then from those we find customer interviews and we pull these things out. The customer interviews one is like the end all beall in my opinion. Like video reviews are used the most in marketing. Customer interviews are used the most in consumption and like getting them warmed up to the idea of even booking a call or once they booked a call getting them in that rabbit hole of consumption before they get on a call to buy something high ticket. So I'm a huge fan of these. These are just kind of quicker clips and like are consumed uh more just because it's more frequent because they're shorter. Um but customer reviews go deeper. So that's the end all goal of this whole piece and then flywheel back up into the front of marketing and it's huge. So we see a direct indicator when we have these working when we have bad reviews we see a direct indicator of show rates and stuff like that. So that's how we do it. Uh feel free to ask any questions. Again I'm just documenting what we've done, what we actively do and how we are working to scale to 100 million a year. Um just no guru no nothing. So, if you guys have any specifics you want, if you're curious about anything, um, drop comments, DM me on Instagram, link will be below, and I can make videos about it and just sharing what we've done. So, appreciate you. Talk soon.

# We booked 119,310 calls with this one tool nobody talks about... | E9
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAy7BPaYmcM

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to show you the exact steps on how to set up a sales team open spot reader All right so why that's important is so you can see 30 days in advance how much availability is on your sales team's calendar is the exact setup we used when we had five sales reps all the way up to 30 sales reps and did 30 million in cash collected last year and this is how marketing can adjust spends depending for a call funnel right so depending if they have 50 or 150 open spots marketing needs to be able to generate those bookings so they need to know how many and how many in advance all right so I'm go through this this is ours I finally figured out a way so I hid our personal info up here so first things first you're going to have a spreadsheet uh a Google sheet that is going to log the date it's going to go 30 days in advance every day and then the First Column is going to be the summary or the sum more so of all of the sales team members so I hid that up here because I just don't want to give away their personal emails and all that um but essentially it will log their emails along here and how many open spots they have across these date ranges okay so this is the actual one that we have used and are actively using so today being March 21st we have 12 open spots and this is not going to show you how many bookings they have just how many open spots we have all right and it kind of does these weird bug things but this always works out to be correct if you actually go and count them all right so first things first you're going to have Google sheet next you're going to have a Google Calendar that is specifically dedicated to managing the sales team right so for us let's call it sales comp.com and what you're going to do and I don't want to open up the calendar because I don't want to give away customer info but on your Google calendar you are going to go in the bottom left and you're going to subscribe to all of your sales reps and this is dedicated just for this if you have subscriptions to anything else it'll count and it'll be wrong okay so you're going to have a sales at whatever company name you're going to go into your Google calendar and you're going to subscribe to all of these different ones okay next what it's going to be able to do is based on so if you click on day view you can see two reps or 20 reps or however many and you'll you with your like just visualizing it will be able to see okay cool there's 30 minute blocks here hours and like rough estimate or you have to count them all issue with that is it's live changing there's availability changes there's people who block all day there is weekend uh volatility in terms of availability all these pieces so what you need to be able to do is forecast that because the marketing team needs to know x amount of days in advance not uh just tomorrow is 70 in the day after is 180 and like you can't have that so you need to try and keep uh consistency there so your spends can stay consistent so what you're going to do is start up a new spreadsheet once you have subscribe to all of them okay and then you're going to go into extensions and you're going to create an app script all right so I'm going to grab the current one that we use and it'll create this little cool calendar automation so I'm going to drop this to you guys and have it somewhere you can just comment if you want it and I'll send it to you because I don't know if I want to publicly post it but but this is essentially the script okay so what it's doing it's creating calendar automation for us the start times this is all an Eastern for us and it's where the account is so for us it's 6:00 a.m. and uh midnight so 6 a.m. to midnight is when we take calls 30 days in advance and then intervals for us we had to do some custom thing so you could actually like just drop this in GPT and get it Rewritten so it doesn't have this like before May after but it doesn't matter um and then you're just going to change these to the block so 30 meaning 30 minutes so for us the sales calls are 30 minutes long if they're 60 minutes if they're 45 you just change them and just change both these it's a little bit of a duct tape solution but it'll work and it doesn't matter um so yeah so right here you can see like we we custom built this a little bit but you can just pass this into GPT and have to do what you want all right and then you're going to go here all right you are going to save that project and you are going to run it right so all we just did is connect this sheet to this script it's going to ask you to review permissions I'm going to pause this and review and just accept you are going to click select all and then just approve it which is what I just did and then the next piece is you're going to want to come in here and create a trigger and you're going to add a trigger that is head that is time driven and then however often an hour fine you can do minutes uh yeah yeah wait minutes and then every 15 is generally best just cuz if you have like sales teams if you're onboarding or offboarding all that CES going to save that it is going to ask you to review configurations again and then you're just going to approve it same exact way we're going to go back to this you can run it all right so now what is happening um so I'm just going to pause on and off because I don't want to give away again customer info or uh team info so what is now happening once you begin running this you set the automation you set the trigger um and it is processing in your spreadsheet so if you go back to your spreadsheet you'll see in the bottom right corner it's going to be like C calendar automation running for sales rep email calendar automation running for sales rep email and what it's doing is it's pulling from your goo calendar in order of the people that you subscribe to excuse me um and showing it's reading their calendar from those time ranges and finding anywhere that they're in this case a 30-minute block and it's counting that as an open spot okay so it's logging all of those and it's doing that 30 days in ADV uh out 30 days okay so I'm going to pause this and then go back to that sheet once it's complete all righty so now I just came back to our sheet and what you're going to see is if you do a hard refresh you're going to have this calendar automation here and you can create that trigger as well here instead of custom making it I forgot about that so you can just click create trigger it'll go through the same process of uh asking you to review the permissions and create it so I would do it right there as well so if you go create trigger running script you sure you want to create this yes and then the script has been finished the trigger's been created all right so now that's going to happen so it's going to look like this and then I just deleted all the sales teams info out of here so I could show you so it'll be total which is the real number you want and then it'll be Buy sales rep so this is a quick way to audit to see if that's correct because like a lot of times sales rep will put things as busy or free or have a full day block somewhere on accident or stuff like that and here you'll see uh you'll see zero you'll see like not available and they should have it available so this is also like a nice little double checker for sales manager sales Ops to be able to check but here you'll be able to see it just pulled 30 days out and now every 15 minutes or 10 minutes or whatever that said uh it is going to pull and update this information for you all right so now live updating here across by sales rep and what you have is you have the date and you have the open spots okay and that's it now it's done now how do you make this functional even more so is you give this to Marketing in a clean way that's easy for them to use all right so what I'm going to do let pop back to our call tracker that I have in another video super super simple call funnel tracker um but this piece this open spots piece is what we're going to have live updating connecting to the other live updating sheet all right so what you're going to do is you're going to go into your spot section and you are going to essentially do an import range function I don't want to give the so you're to do an import range where you're going to put the spreadsheet URL of the uh new call Tracker so you're going to grab this spreadsheet URL all right and then so it's called calendar summary on here because this is like what it autogenerated and created so you're going to come into here you are going to go whatever xyz.com whatever or you know whatever Google spreadsheet link and I'm going to put ours in and then pause it but and then you're going to go the uh range string which is going to be calendar summar and then it's going to be you want in this example you want want this is where you want to start so you'd want A2 to B so you'd want A2 to B just like that and you close this out all right so I'm going to pause this and put our actual one in there all righty so there you go so now it what it's going to have is inside A2 you just put that import range function and it's going to be pulling from this and it's just going to be grabbing this section right here okay so you technically do it from A1 just do this whole block because here we already had the header on here that said date in open spot so I'm just leaving it um but essentially you could just pull either so all you want is the date that's live updating as well and then the amounts which are really live updating now when you pop back into your summary and what are we on right now 321 you pull these out for how many spots oops I don't even have it plugged in there and it will live update on this sheet so now marketing can actively see this you can send this into the dashboard or as a dashboard into your marketing channel you can just have this they always have it open more or less and every 15 minutes is going to adjust and show and why is like super important is because okay if you look across this range we have you know 116 112 so like ours are pretty consistent right now as you go across but what happens when you have four sales reps that get fired or whatever are terminated and then you have 17 new ones starting and like you know I mean like you have all these constant changes and they need to know or if you have a 3-day thing where a bunch of people are at conference together and like there's this low you don't want to change Facebook spends obviously like that aggressively but it's always good to know what the target is so like with this target if your goal is 80% booked right here I just like quick by eye I see you know 115 so you want 115 times 08 so you want 92 call it and then just whatever round up you want 100 bookings and right now if you look at your cost per booking across ranges and you know that it's 200 and I said whatever I said let's call it 110 so you want 110 I think I said yeah I said 100 and then if you know it's cost per of on average of 200 like your team should be targeting 200 or I'm sorry 20,000 in spend if your numbers are consistent you know it's around 200 per booking you want to fill 80% you want to like hit these numbers because you have cancels and no shows and reschedules so this just gives you eyes is the most important thing here on where this is and actively changing 30 30 days in advance so this is a little hack we used when we had I think five reps we kind of started to run into this and we're like oh this could be an issue and then we use this exact same system still in a sheet actually um we like put it into looker and all these other view like places but this is still the way that we actively manage uh for marketing to be able to see this up to 30 something sales reps so little more tactical um if you guys have any questions uh if you want this exact script and all this kind of stuff just DM me on Instagram I'll have the link below in this but yeah I just don't want to publicly post it so just DM me and I'll send it over so talk soon

# we do $30m/yr in info... here's our slack setup | E8
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYHxr7HMmjc

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go into the slack and communication setup that we use at our info coaching business that did 30 million in cash collected last year um so gold this channel is just to be raw tactical exactly what we are doing and have done in the past and with the hopes of helping somebody get a 2 5 10% lift in a piece of their business because when you're doing Millions a month that is needle mover in Top Line or bottom line depending um so these are the basic chunks that I'm going to use I'm going to fill these in as we go so for all team we'll start there we have three channels and again this is meant to just be raw like I don't care about the editing and the fancy and the how to make your first 10K and all that um there's a time and place for that for sure but not for us right now so all team so first thing you're going to have is our general so that's like the classic slack setup this is where we use for like announcements and um all hands meetings stuff like that um so birthday is all of th those pieces walking the walk is a huge piece for us as a fitness coaching business so for us walking the walk means anybody in the company that is walking the walk so um people do step counts they do personal training uh wins um new gym wins um nutrition wins anything like that that they're actually doing it we're a huge believer in someone who walks the walk is going to be a good coach is going to be a good sales uh team member is going to be good manager anything you have to believe in what we do which is selling that dream right and living that dream so client wins this is a fun one this is basically started as helping the sales team uh so you hear this in a lot of like sales programs that having a client's wins channel is huge and that has 5 to 10 messages a day that gets fed from CS and um the coaching team right because they'll just fill it sales team will see like oh I sold this woman two weeks ago 6 months ago wherever and they're getting success and here's it before and after here's any of that um so you can do this in any industry you can do MMO someone you know just hit a new just hit 10K mon just hit whatever um but for us it is in Fitness so these are the ones that like all of the team are in um operations and I have videos on the channel where I talk about a bit of the team setup um but for operations I just bucketed this as we have an owner's chat which is just the couple owners of the company so where we talk about like just stuff owners need to know and like tax stuff and um we have certain meetings and like monthly updates and stuff that we go through there and then we also have an automated tracker that goes into there with like a uh basically a day over- day week over week month um cash flow statement that we all see so it's just stuff that's like a little bit higher level uh goes into there now another piece of this is like I just said dashboards so I'll go through there's dashboards in a ton of these that are specific to the actual Department which is huge so the whole point of this of the SL setup in general is for communication having the right people in the right buckets and then like really again just driving behavior and streamlining it so it's not confusing but like it's the most efficient way to do it right so even as I went through this like you'll see I'll start to talk about stuff that I'm like oh maybe we could like combine these or cut these but that's where we're at so operations this is going to be our like sea level you could call it so um I have again I have other videos on the channel where I talk about this but this is essentially going to be like CMO sales manager um me uh leading Tech CS product CEO right like all the department heads and this is a weekly meeting Cadence but this is like the higher level stuff and for us these are like really strong leaders so everyone comes together in this meeting and then also in this channel to have communication that then funnels down into the rest of the company on like how they lead their departments um operations reports so all of the uh people on this operations team do a weekly report on what got done where you stuck all that um kind of like classic one to1 report and then that is brought into a weekly Cadence of uh one toone meetings that happen with CEO and then me as well and I kind of I'm like in this weird CTO coo uh role but again like only operator in terms of like uh hurting this team and making sure that uh our facilitating I guess probably way better way to say it of this team in terms of meetings and communication and all that so that's option reports um Human Resources the fun one everyone loves um so human resources for us we have 105 I believe 106 right now W2 employees and then handful of contractors that are um external or uh out of country depending whatever um out of us for us so we have a payroll channel so this is essentially the actual dollars so um this has automated things that'll go into here oh and then quick back on this so I want to try and cover what happens automated too because that's super important so the owner one like I said is a cash flow statement operations this is an operations dashboard that comes into here every day that will have uh like basically the stats from yesterday everything from new rev to units to booking count uh cost per sale everything like what drives the business in that way and then we also have an operations dashboard that we use that has specific kpis in it that each person brings to the table that comes before this meeting so I'll do another uh I'll do another video that's about the actual meeting Cadence and what happen on those but this is just the communication setup so payroll is going to be the dollars so this is going to be just a couple people that are basically HR lead and then some of the uh owners or all the owners and then some of the people in operations to see like the actual dollars going out we do a bi-weekly right now HR operations is going to be the more tactical stuff like back and forth and when there's issues and pieces that happen there so again small team on here small team on here HR Support this one's a bit wider so this is going to include the people that are also in onboarding so when there's like random issues and stuff like that they generally speaking will go back to like who is on boarding or leading the department in those pieces so this one is going to include just the uh basically owners in a couple operations this one's going to include more people that has connection to people that can submit issues or whatever comes up onboarding setup this is dedicated to HR of onboarding so that's Tech setup that's making sure they're getting the right pieces that's making sure that w9s are or I9 or whatever are like all of those pieces that they're getting access to the right platforms we use Rippling right now we use Gusto forever so making sure they have that and then terminations this is an automated one that when someone's terminated in our uh in our system then they get pushed into here and then also where like requests are done so if there's someone who is um terminated in XYZ way it'll get pushed into there we'll make sure all the processes followed through there all right now the first one that most people are interested in and the big one or one of the big ones I guess marketing so I'm going to try and rip through these as best I can but copyrighting so this was the OG marketing channel so this has been this copyrighting channel has been around for like four years so since we're doing like a million a year we've had this copyrighting Channel and uh it essentially was our marketing one but so copyrighting is literally just copywriters CMO and then uh the couple operator operations team so like me Luke um and a couple others that are in this copyrighting Channel all things copy get done in here email Cadence changing updating um any of that and then same thing with like vssl scripts will happen um ad scripts will happen page thing just all that happens in copyrighting marketing this is like the everyone is in it in marketing and we did not have this up until like months a few months ago until we just brought in a new CMO which is actually this week but uh a month ago or so we actually made this and centralized everything CU marketing was almost acting siloed and as I talk more in these videos you see like that was a clear like not good plan that we had right everyone in their own buckets and like not working and seeing all the same data so marketing is where we're going to have all of the dashboards and all that go into so marketing will get an open spots uh snapshot basically so it'll see how many bookings are on day the percentage of booked and then out 14 days so they can constantly adjust spends and make sure that they're hitting uh the you know 80% Target and then also just like an overall tracker so uh I have other videos where I go through the tracker but like cost per leag cost per app cost per booking cost per sale all those zap in uh yeah zap into here and then all things communication around marketing so now that we're doing new offers and low ticket and all that that all goes into there creative paid this is going to be like the actual creative so editing side of things for the paid and then creative for the organic um the organic one has more communication in it because it includes more people um so because it's actually creating it it is posting it more or less um and then it is putting it across all the places and then notifying uh copyrighting that they can like send emails to it so example uh new podcast or video is made gets edited they have all their coms in there about that once it is edited it is posted live so it's distributed then uh Tech team will take it and put it on the website and all the other you know relevant locations then they'll notify email uh of the copyrighting team and then they will be able to send emails to it to get that initial boost and then just add value right um so again I can have other videos that I make about like clickup boards and all that jazz but that's just this marketing feedback this is just a survey that we have somewhere built in there that gives feedback to marketing on why they came in what they saw what was most uh interesting to them to try and get uh Market feedback Talent Development this is the operations side of talent development so we have multiple brand faces that we are testing um this entire time to 70 million cash collected uh or whatever so far we've used one brand face who's the co-founder uh co-owner uh and just like Superstar so she has been the brand face up until now so now we are trying to go wider and have less uh founder risk in terms of the all the things actually so like traffic Source uh brand face product everywhere we're just trying to get wider in that with more while also staying like hyperfocused on like a couple specific offers that can crank with multiple faces okay so this is the operations of that so this will have the couple people who are in charge of managing that so for us it's like cheaper products SL people um it's going to be the CMO uh creative director all those pieces and this is where they basically talk about the operation side of it and then these are the dedicated channels that have the different um brand faces in them who are external so like other influencers basically um so in all these I'm just going to put like name one company all that cuz I don't want to dox anyone then I don't think it's fair to I wish I could share my actual slack and just show you but like there's sensitive information there so I can't share customer stuff or client name or team name like that's just not fair to them so I'm not going to do that yet until I figure out a better way or I hire an editor who can do this for me and until then I'm going to shoot looms and I'm going to record like this so uh ads company external so we have uh company that does edits this is actually kind of more so for like vsl edits but their company name starts with ads but um so these will be vssl edits and like the Crazy Design you know the the like if you see high grade direct response vssl ads these guys edit these we have an email one sometimes you have issues where when you're Mass sending your delivery and your more so your open rates just like tank so we have an external company of this guy that we basically you know they come up with a fix almost every time it's just new fix they roll it out so we just keep this so external meaning that in slack it's like an external connection so their organization is connected with ours they finally made it so you could like change your name on yours so we title them all like this so these are all the actual titles of the channel by the way so um external external external and those all sit in a bucket up here in my slack at least um that shows which one have external teams in them uh vssl company so this is a vssl writer that we have or that we basically test and that is like a performance Model guy that does that so that's going to have so all anything basically down is going to have all the leads of marketing and then the specific people relevant to it okay so email for that vssl page build same thing so this is going to have me Luke uh the CMO and then um so like basically CTO coo uh CEO CMO and then the actual person or their team right so like page build same thing here SEO same thing here we have one contractor that's outside that does this and then Tracking Company external we use a uh custom tracking setup so we use hyros we we've used hyros for like four years and we still have it on but we don't have feeding the pixel we have a complete custom setup for tracking um that is needs to have communication around it because when you change something you update this you need to make sure all that's in there so I can do another long video on that because we have a very custom setup for that and I'm sure they would love if we shared that so Tech next piece Tech is going to have the uh the senior Tech lead myself and then again main operators main operations people so Tech admin is the main channel that we will talk about just overarching things so a lot of times it's just me and the uh senior Tech League going back and forth communicating on things um tech support this is an internal one um that is basically which is can be confusing with the internal support So tech support itself basically is like all the support tickets so we have a a tech ticket that launches and goes into these different buckets and then they can um you can basically say like which part of the company they're having an issue with they can outline it they can Loom and then they submit a ticket because it was getting crazy and like customer support and all these other ways of asking everything from like an email reset to like a client level thing so we have tech support here that is a basically ticket submitting that auto occurs uh internal support this is we have a tech support VA that is has been with the company for like four and a half years absolutely crushes but she basically logs everything she's doing um cuz she does like she's really really good at Sops so she will come in and do every day it'll be all these 19 things that we can't automate and every time we post a video it'll be do this and we'll upload a training it'll get put in this back office and like all that kind of stuff um so she does all that and logs it in this internal support and then also you can go to ask her specific things in here it's basically her Channel um so we'll just go in there and just be where is she internal support versus like customer support she will support everyone on the team um SMS company we have an external we're testing blue send right now this is an example of another external company uh that we are in so it'll be just be again same people it'll be me it'll be senior Tech lead it'll be CEO and uh yeah app design company this is for when we were doing uh design for the Fulfillment for a product that's inside fulfillment so just a design company and then this is when we did the website overhaul we have these guys and they're also on call SL like a ticketing system so when we have updates and things that we need we just put it in there they create a ticket and it's managed through okay sales I hope this is super dry and fun because that's how it's supposed to be um sales sales operations is the uh basically leadership of them so that's going to be your sales manager it's going to be your sales uh ops manager or like a coordinator Setter manager and then all the right sea level right so all things dashboards pop into here for sales team of a management perspective okay so you have sales team which has like the entire actual sales team in it and they get dashboards that are specific to to their commissions and their performance production all that operations is going to get the overall manager level one so they're going to get what was overall this overall that right and Beyond sales hot leads this is a fun one this is basically if people submit it's B it's just it's hot leads simply put so anytime there's low ticket buyer it zaps into there anytime there is a custom time request zaps into there anytime a call is going over pushes into there anytime someone has some crazy intent pushes into there and they claim them comment on them and then uh take them offline or in the HubSpot more so so sales team that's just everyone like I said um this is the one that's going to have the most Communications in here these are notification channels okay so applications pushes every time we have a new application opportunities every time we have a new uh booking opportunities direct every time a closer has a direct booking so when they use their booking link to get like to a reschedule or if they're mining the CRM because they a noow or whatever um they these will fire into here new clients this is every time uh new purchase is made so what actually happens is the deal is marked as one inside HubSpot it's actually marked as sales approval in HubSpot they push into here and then the leaders of sales the ops manager and the uh actual sales manager uh will approve them and then they push into new clients right so just make sure that no one messed anything up the date the fields are all filled out correctly and all of that um so this is like the hype up channel so this one's going to have just yeah all the hype um cohort onboarding we onboard different cohort ports in like different buckets so when they overlap is when we start to use one two and three which we've done a lot over the last over 2024 we did this a lot where every two weeks we basically had them but they were still like dripping out of the other one so instead of just putting them all in one bucket we do cohorts right now on the Cadence we're at we only use one and then two and three basically just sit there idle until we're at a point where we have to uh bucket them and this is going to be all things on boarding all questions all what cuz if you're dropping questions in your brand new sales rep and there's five of them and they're asking all these questions in sales team or sales team questions like it's it gets brutal so we have like dedicated onboarding team that does this um like a hype officer that's in there that knows all the systems all the uh all the everything sales reports they do an end of week report for us and then they have their own trackers and all that um but just in terms of like comms they fill out a report that's a job form that then zaps into here so they're all in one place and then sales team questions this is any technical question there's a couple coaches in here and then there's also uh all the sales team and so it's basically like some more technical questions or something maybe a sales rep is not going to know not new onboarding not know but like just things that are kind of crazy in different directions and then same thing if like an order form's not working or if something's bugging like and they're on the on a call like this is their go-to spot that they'll ask and try and get support from operations Tech whatever uh or coach so Setters this is new to us so I'm going to kind of combine these but Setters so you're going to have Setter team which is same thing a sales team it's just all your Setters and management of that Setter application so these are all brand new so where we're at currently is like we've run this kind of in the past but it's never worked for us so we haven't had a Setter team in the last like two years um so we didn't use Setters at all to do any of these numbers um and now we're trying to again into the future so Setter team and then Setter application so Setter application is going to be basically someone who applies but doesn't book after like 3 minutes and then it's going to zap into there bum they can dial and go from there we have ai on this already but we're going to try and like overlap and do both of them at the same time and see how that goes so this will be like a basically like a hot leads Channel and then we will also see if this channel eventually it likely is just going to move over to cters completely which will be good so because then these guys can just focus on closing and not on hot leads and bouncing back and forth and Mining the CRM and all that because the setter still do that um set end of day they do end of days uh our manager wants to push for that so he will doing end of days instead of end of weeks Mand help this is our AI bot that I was talking about so when it Flags or sees any sentiment inside there that is like maybe a human needs to step in they push into here so it's another like hot lead basically Channel when the AI can does not want to respond uh they can claim them here and then triage team and triage operations so triage operations is going to be so we call Triage call confirmation or we call it triage but a lot of people call it call call confirmation this is the team that directly dials all of the bookings right after they're done right after they've booked okay so it's like instant hey just want to confirm that it's this time zone that you know it's a zoom call all that so we use an offshore team right now actually um that is 20 hours or I think yeah 20 hours a day s days a week so the operations is us with just their uh project manager or like team lead and then this is the actual team of the of the women that are actually making the dials um and we there's what three or four in there customer success I hope this is thrilling to everyone cuz it is to me um customer succcess this is like lifeblood of the company these are your di hards they are like the glue that keeps us all together um great great team here Community Management this is just uh for the actual communities it so we use Facebook as our communities because our Target markets 40 to 60y year old women um so it fits so Community Management any comms around that kind of stuff CS escalations so we call them escalations and then you have like escalations track of basically someone wanting refunds someone upset someone whatever and then you have refunds from there and then it's a percentage of escalation to refund and that we track on a week over week basis uh and they Crush these so like last week we had whatever 10 escalations on however many 4,000 clients or something like that and zero refunds so these are women that like wanted to refund need to talk to someone all that and then CS de escalated them all so this basically coms around that customer support this is I this needs to almost be up here I think it actually probably is should be up there Co but I'll just leave it but customer support this is the like or did I just move it on there it is um customer support this is like all company customer support anything that involves a client goes in like goes into here so billing requests forms uh someone can get into something login so like Tech and billing manage this just nonstop um we try and keep the tech support to internal Tech issues anything that ever touches a customer directly is going to be in here okay um so this is like this is a really big channel for us enrollment feedback so these are one toone uh surveys and anytime we get feedback or any of this stuff gets automated and sent into these okay so same thing with like set team sales team like those get all those dashboards I was saying any of like the main Hub of those will get dashboards that can then drive Behavior incentivize and nbm uh enrollment enrollment feedback is the feedback forms that happen after the Cs team does the onboarding call because for us it is a close then they schedule in with an onboarding specialist which is a CS rep and then they basically make sure they have all their Tech Systems they have all their docs they're excited all things and then they pass them off and assign them to a coach because we have 70 coaches so it'll like it depends on availability and open and all that um so enrollment feedback is uh feedback on how that call went that the customer fills out failed payments this is for a billing it's just if someone's auto pay um in one of the pay plans or whatever breaks this used to be way more relevant when we were selling a ton of pay plans and a ton of that uh not as relevant now but still retention management this is brand new we are rolling out a retention team that has that is uh top sales reps that then were pod managers uh or pod leaders so they would had basically 10 to 15 sales reps under them because we had up to 30 sales reps at one point uh last year and they now have moved over to retention so they're completely out of Front End Sales and now there's an entire system and flow in the back end that will basically create pipelines for them of women who are going to clients who are going to renew in 60 days and then book calls with them go through how their experience has been get a bunch of valuable feedback back as well as position to then renew them into the next year cuz that's where a bunch of the money is made um I have another video where I go over this but it's like 80% margins on the back end or the renewal more so um than it is on the front so this is comms all around that and specific to that support SMS we have the main lines of the company that send out blast and are just like all over everything so that comes into here which is also managed by the um the customer success like lead who does all the email management as well as all these SMS management merchandise external we use an external company to do like 3pl and all the stuff for all the swag that we have uh we just have like a very lean shop if people do want swag is like the ninth time we've tried it we finally found a company external that does really good and just does everything for us and it's high quality so we have one of these external um supplement Ops and support So we had a testing kit that we used for like the entire last year that everyone got on purchase and then basically does a call with them and then talks to them if they want supplements and then we get commissions and it was like a attempt to increase LTV and increase customer experience and like results it didn't really go great I'm GNA be honest we're paying for all the kits the backed out math was like I don't want to tell you how bad it was like just let's just say we lost like 96% of the money in terms of what we got back but and do the math on what you think how many commas there are um but supplement Ops is the like basically team that manages it so on their side and on our side and then support is both on our side and their side who does the actual like this person didn't get a kit this person is trying to schedule a call that back and forth so both on our side and like the Cs like actual representative who's talking to the person in email and then on their side of that same thing and then Ops the people who we talking about like we need different commission percentages and we need that right and then last piece coaching so coaching for us means fulfillment so info guys and gals um for us we're coaching so we have 70 coaches um or 65 or something in that range right now um that actually fulfill on the product so one toone coaching so check-ins is a part of our fulfillment process so we have like a weekly we have these different cadences of check-ins where the clients are submitting and they're submitting them into here and they also have some feedback in them um this is going to be all your coaches and then all of operations of coaches um coaches here is the same thing as like you know sales team it's all coaches so this is all announcements this is any you know fun and just back and forth um but those are all in there questions this is going to act the same way as a sales team question um so kind of for onboarding but mainly for like once you're in a position or like some client has an interesting request or someone's vegan or someone has XYZ you know disease or something like has anyone else dealt with this like a lot of that questions side of things will happen in there and then Tech also in there to help same thing with the onboarding as sales so we will do them cohorts when we're like ramping ramping fast when we get under I believe the number is 250 to 300 open spots uh that's when we start like the real hiring aggressive Cadence because sales when they're crushing is doing 400 plus units and then beyond and our next we of growth is the plan um so then we start hiring to make sure that the availability is there and then these are the same things so just onboarding cohorts if they overlap we use multiple and in the past we've scaled up to at least three on boarding in different cadences so like week over week they're basically starting and overflowing on the two to four week uh onboarding flow exit surveys super valuable feedback because for us in Fitness it's like if you help them get the result they leave and if you don't help them get the result they leave so uh it's kind of interesting just to gather all the information and see I mean definitely what they feel about the coach and the product and the overall stuff but then like reasons they're leaving um because then maybe we can better tune the retention team onto getting them to stay because of community and personalization or community and accountability but they don't need to know this and this because they learned it over the last year right so super uh valuable valuable for us feedback so that's throughout the process feedback is throughout the process exits on the way out so feedback these constantly are firing off so there's a month one there's a six-month one there's a random one that goes out and these are just constantly just getting feedback from like how do you feel about this like where how do you feel like we're doing where can we approve where can we whatever and then these are also what route when over nine I believe nine NPS score these route to the reviews and then gather reviews and then weekly reports same thing as uh all these other weekly reports they do a weekly update of basically what happened what they're working on what's good anything that came up or not um and yeah so that's a general gist so hopefully this wasn't too dry uh I tried to make it a little cleaner instead of just having these all pre-written on here so uh that you guys would just see everything and then just bounce uh but hopefully you get some value out of these and you know people are telling me I need to do editing and need editors and mics and all that I did get a mic because audio is important so mic's on the way but the uh editing and making them all flashy and doing that I don't know how I feel about that it's not really my goal of this to have hundreds of thousands views necessar like on these type of videos uh more so just have the right people 10 people people whatever in that range of people that are actually in the weeds actually doing it actually building so that's all I got uh drop a comment find me on Instagram do anything let me know what you want to see and I can just crank out these videos whenever so let me know

# this is how we track out $70,000,000 funnel (full breakdown) | E7
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYKcJ8Z8GVQ

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through a call funnel 1.0 tracker this is a very similar setup we use to track and do 30 million cash collected last year uh on One Singular call funnel all right so I'm calling this 1.0 because and I'll kind of get into that uh about how more advanced versions and pieces of this uh this is all demo data so I don't necessar look at this but I'll go through each piece and go through kpis there's other videos on the Channel that I go through that no guru no oh yeah 9x all the time uh by any means so you want to stick around at least until we get to this portion because this is kind of the more advanced ninja stuff and then I'll talk about more automated ways and all that that this goes so first things first just going through what kpis are on here um so I marked pink for what is essentially an input and then a blue for what is a calculation okay so first thing you're going to have is leads apps bookings sales count of sales uh add cost new rev and then you're going to have from that you're going to have your row ads which is going to be your new rev to your ad cost your cost per lead your cost per app your cost per booking cost per sale your app to lead percentage so right how many apps came from the leads your bookings per app so how many bookings came from your apps and then your sales per booking right and then all these are going to have like breakdowns right sales per booking is just a blended number of all bookings and sales but like what goes into that is going to be show rate and reschedules and live but this is just like this is more or less a way for marketing and for for kind of like overall to see you're not going to use this for add attribution and tracking you're not going to do that into sheets like you can but it this just makes no sense and I'll get into softwares and like ways to do automations of this calls on day there's going to be how many calls were initially generated for the day okay so like if you had 10 calls come in that were booked today but were booked for tomorrow this would show 10 calls are on that day is when the call was booked for now again this is also why you kind of want automated or why you want Dynamic data going forward once you get to a certain scale because calls on day is going to change dramatically when people reschedule um when uh I mean mainly when people reschedule but when people reschedule when they double book when all that kind of stuff happens because this would be a standard and like stay as a single record which you don't want spots this is the Ninja part that I'll get into but is essentially how many open spots are available on that given day and then book percentage is a percentage of calls on day so uh divided by the total amount right so all right how you're going to get this information in here so there are people who do this manual and do it the day after I pref I don't like that and I always like live data and automated but there this is like again 1.0 way to do this over time you'll have all this in HubSpot and crms and all that kind of stuff but like even then I still run out of a sheet for the big Master now it's all live and updating and has way more information in it that's why I kind of don't want to show it because there's like customer data and stuff um but this is just the general like what you need in kpis to over like overall look and see what you need to do so for leads what you're going to do is you're going to have a tab here that's literally just going to be the date and the person's email I GPT and just or I didn't need GPT this but it did um so all you're going to have is the date that they opted in and their email okay because all you need to do is basically be able to count all right that will then count those that are in there for that given day apps exact same thing now the question becomes how much data and what else are you going to do with it because if you have a zap setup that says every time that these come in here you want to put this in here what else you get on that when that happens you get a lot more information you get their name you get like browser information you get all that so I'm a big fan of just all the data you can possibly get so but also being like functional and realistic so for what you're going to use this for the most you're probably going to want is like email name if you do phone number all that kind of stuff stuff because like over time you can batch them back and be like oh if they were a lead and an app and a booking do this that and all that again not something I'm like a super fan of just for this use case that exists but not in this so name and email is fine app same thing right so now you're going to do the same thing with applications so you're going to have the date that they came in all these are just Zapped in right so you just want a constant inflow of these coming in here and then these act as like a database like the simplest database in the world um but act as a database that you can then store and you can come back here and adjust these records but in current form if a zap's coming in they're pushing it in nothing's updating it someone changes their email doesn't get updated here right so you got to understand that this is not live in that way it's live in terms of inflow not in terms of updating okay then what else do you want to put in here you can do the same thing like you put name you can put all the application questions if you have hidden Fields you could do all of that in here but again for this use case and if this is our goal you don't need any of that information okay so that's apps bookings this is the first one you're going to have a little bit more on so this is going to be when someone book uh the date that someone clicked to book their email the sales rep they're signed to this was important for us for a really long time because we had another tab other than the summary that would do it by sales reps so you knew like how many sales reps had what and I can get into that in another one but another big one is the call date so someone today booked a call for tomorrow or someone today booked a call for today so this important you want this cuz you want to know not not how many units you sold today versus how many bookings you generated today you want to do how many sales you had today based on how many bookings were booked for today so a big difference there and again we learned all this just by doing it real time and like there's we have evolved 92 times over but like still to this day if we're just like split test and just or uh just like launch a new offer quick something like this is basically the setup we would still use because these are the only kpis you need and and it's 95% accurate 90% whatever that it'll get you there so booking sale for a sale you want the date of the purchase I do name and email on these cuz sometimes these are like a little bit more inform uh I want more information on this the type of purchase they did any data you put in here is going to allow you to query by it so if you want to know how many full pays your aovs on these versus this your aov across the whole thing uh uh the different type the count of different type like you can only do that if you have the data in here so full pays two pays and then the amount that they paid and then who the sales rep was again if you ever want to have a sheet over here a summary of Buy sales rep across range all that you would need the sales rep information here and you need the sales rep information here because then you because the only time a sales rep is assigned is booking and sale ads This Is How We Do It um still to this day uh where it's the day it is the total which is basically sum of the different traffic sources so like for us in this example and these are going just demo information but the traffic one would be Facebook so you just have Facebook up here this would be Google with brand search retarget right simple stuff like that for these numbers at least and then whatever Tik Tok or wherever else you're running LinkedIn ads and then spots I'll get into this one but spots well actually I'll just do this one now so ads back here this is either you do it the day after which we did for like three years every single morning after plug in the daily spend pop into the ad accounts and plug this in for prior day now we use use ad veronic and this automatically does that okay so this is I think free maybe it's like 100 bucks but I think it's it's free forever when we used it and this is very very um helpful it can be every 15 minutes or something like that can auto update pull to your ad accounts and then you can pick which ones it does of these and then it'll just stay automated so then over here real time throughout the day you have leads apps booking sales increasing and then you have your ad cost increasing as well and then ideally new rev and then all of this is relatively live flowing okay same thing with calls on day and then spots so for spots I got to figure out a way to get you guys this but what you need to do is you we have a master calendar call it sales at whatever company.com okay that calendar subscribes to all of your sales reps okay so when you click on that calendar on the little plus and Google Calendar wherever you guys use you can see everyone's calendar there you can click on on day and you can see everyone's across right and people share all the screenshots like oh we're full booked and all that it's like that now we hired somebody on upor cheap I don't even know 50 bucks 250 bucks somewhere in there to build us a Google script that will read that Google Calendar and is going to tell you the open spots available across those calendars uh 30 days in advance okay so what that looks like in like reality is that you'll have four sales reps and they'll be 50% booked okay the Google script is going to look across across what range so for us the hours are 8:00 a.m. to midnight Eastern so it's going to look from 8:00 a.m. to uh midnight Eastern and it's going to find all of the 30 minute because our calls are 30- minute blocks it's going to find all of the white space of 30 minutes and it's going to count that as one right throughout each person it's going to log that into a master sheet that is by that's auto updating every 15 minutes or 30 minutes across by their email sales rep email and then down by date and it's going to have this person has four availability so they have 2 hours right cuz 30 minutes uh this person has 12 availability so 6 hours this person is zero because they're on priority and they have no open spots it's going to rank them all and then over here on it's going to have a sum total of everyone across the day which is what marketing needs they don't care if one person's fully or the other's not or whatever but like just for marketing sake so this will tell you that you have six open spots available tomorrow basically meaning that the Google script went off is live updating and the Google script went off and found that there was whatever 3 hours of Open Spaces across the entire sales she that are available to book okay I got to figure out how to get you that too but it's it's not really that complicated but like I think we learned it from uh I'm forgetting his name right now but he does it with his Google Calendar to like count how he allocates his time and we're like oh we should build one of those so I'm hopefully there's a tool out there that does that by now but we still use the custom one so why that's important is because booked percentage is a target that we use for marketing so marketing constantly is trying to keep calendars 80% booked um again this is 90% accurate because calls on day is going to fluctuate and uh spots is basically going to read only into the future so if like things happen in the past it can't read that which it shouldn't but that's a back and forth thing and then spots and then you get book percentage all right notes big key here that we use you update an opt in you want to test a new email flow of something that is just overarching to the company or to the marketing more so of the company like just throw a note in here it's super super helpful like if I I have ours pulled up over here on the side but like a price increase uh we tested a short form booking page we turned splits on we ran 14 days we killed the splits all right so all of that is just important to track in here just cuz you want to over time be like why when you look back and you have months of this you're like we were steady humming at 56% or whatever uh app to booking or booking to app or whatever you want to call it right here and then it trended now it's at 40 and it's been at 40 like what changed over that time and then it just this makes it so you can make decisions is all this is about it's just literally being able to make better decisions all right so that's the gist of how to get all these in okay lead at booking sale ads spots okay these are all of your inflows now how do you do that zaps make whatever you want to use to do that a VA it doesn't matter I mean you want to do it automated because you want to be able to see this real time throughout the day and get kind of like okay cool right now I can see especially for this like we're targeting we're targeting hitting these numbers so I'm going to plug in some actual numbers now and just plug them into here and just overwrite these but you see the formulas they're simple it's like count these ones some anything that's multiples these are all formulas of what exists on this sheet right and then same thing counting summing because this one's a uh you want because it's one field and then same thing on sheet right very simple that's the whole point it's 1.0 tracker very very clean and simple now let me plug in some actual stuff I just picked a random day of uh August in 2024 so for us and I'm just going to overwrite these just so you can see I'll do this actually so here so we had 1,200 uh 1,200 leads we had 200 13 apps we had 102 bookings we spent $35,000 we had 23 new units we did 157 this is a special day so this actually it's probably bad cuz so we'll run twice a year specials that are internal or no it wasn't eight I don't know I actually cannot I can look back at this later but I believe that we R in a special that day and then call calls on day was 149 and open spots was 59 all right so again no guru no whatever I'm just telling you this was a day that we had on 81224 okay and then the day after we had a 2.7% row as and the day after we had a 1.8 and then a 3.8 and then a 1.6 and then a 5 and then a 4.9 then a 4.9 then a 1 .9 so like it bounces all over the board but like what you'll be able to do is get Trends and um and get averages across those all right so now that I'm using this this is actual data in here so this would be live pulling real time but now you can see so we spent 35 Grand that day to do 157 in new now how our sheets exist is a bunch of these versions of these tabs but for like sale for example we have the entire inflow of all money that comes into the company so this marketing piece of this is like this part of a sheet that's this big that is an entire cash flow statement for the entire company okay that has all expenses that come through QuickBooks that have all income that come through stripe so active uh low ticket like anything else would come in there as well so in our sale for example that sale tab ours is like all inflows of all money then we have a categorizing as what's new what's active what type uh what sales rep all of those things we have a refund tab that then pulls back like we have all that over time that's evolved that all just started with this because we make decisions based on this then track and also then make decisions on the overall cash flow of the company there and then of course we have QuickBooks and all that for like proper books and accounting um which even that is like we're tentative on if we should move off that because of how big we are now but like it's such a simple in andout flow um that it still makes sense for us but all to say this is a simple version okay so 35k spent uh to do 157 so we had $28 cost per lead which is actually interesting cuz like I look at this now I'm like all right our cost per lead right now on average is 18 18 bucks call it 1819 bucks and right now we're having a down period and like again no guru like we're having a down period right now where the sales are not backing out so marketing is like checking all the boxes and that would be a question of Okay cool so if we have 16 to 19 whatever dollar lead but they're not backing out is it just a quality issue like are we just is is how the new marketing is set up or how wherever pockets of traffic we're in is that just bad quality because it doesn't matter if your lead cost is $6 if no one buys like I'd rather have a $50 cost per lead and then as long as it backs out to what really matters is just cost per sale so out of this day $28 lead $164 application $343 booking and $1,500 unit okay so a 17% app to lead and at that range that's where we were that was very steadily there now our numbers are higher right now they're 20 to 25% uh lead to app and that is because we've rolled out V2 of application we changed up how it was we made less free form we did all that kind of stuff so we have a higher percent of that now um after to booking this is when we had uh uh a little bit less of a so one we had no routing so we had no Financial qualifier so we had no routing up or down so like this is basically giving everyone an opportunity who applies to book and then it was a little bit less friction in terms of like the text that was on page to get them to stop or whatever and sales per booking on day this is just raw all bookings that were booked for that day at one point um is 22% all right so calls on day 149 open spots 50 9 so we are 71 71% booked now this is even low because what we have the media buying team marketing overall optimized for is trying to get 80 so we just try and always stay at 80 you don't we don't want to go higher than that uh because I mean you do go higher than that but like you start to go too high and you're just burning money because there's nowhere for them to book two days in advance and that's a thing to monitor like over time because right here what this will actually look like is this um 5 z z z z so when this is actually built out it'll look like so what is this 200 so you have 150 spots then you'll have 180 spots then you'll have 90 spots 190 190 190 190 whatever rough numbers obviously is going to change day over Day based on sales team availability and all this so you're going to see on day you have this you're generating 100 bookings in a day that are starting to fill today as well as tomorrow and then how many available spots do you have tomorrow okay and what you're going to constantly have the media buying team is like Okay cool so like our Target is this 180 190 a day so if we have 180 and we want to fill 80% of that we need to Target 145 bookings so we just round up and say you want to generate 150 bookings our current cost per call is $340 so call it $34 45 so like in order to do that in this example and again those are just like thrown out there because if you look at this what we were actually booking was 150 right but uh in that model you'd be spending 50k a day in order to fill that so again this model is at some level hamster wheelie and like you constantly have to fill and you constantly have to be able to do that and this is still this is when we're operating even in current state until the end of this week with no Setters no low ticket no nothing just straight raw someone books in gets on a calendar try to sell them right so they're managing 150 bookings on day which this is this is legit number um these are actuals so there's 150 30 minute sales calls booked for that day um across at that time probably I don't even I don't even want to give a fake number but I think it was probably 20 something sales reps at that at that time we got up to like 30 um and since we have scaled down um because frankly we had a big like marketing style explosion we were filling calendars at like half and then we moved everyone to W2 and then we did all these changes then marketing started to refill and like basically where we're at now is cost per everything is dialed and but it's not backing out so it could be sales team Vibe it could be quality um but the quality is there we have Financial qualifiers now so you can see them um you and then the biggest thing is you have two sales reps that are performing extremely well and if you look and like they've seen lead flow so then it would go to tell you it's all just like how do you make decisions how much data do you have to make good decisions if you have two people with the same lead flow that are doing well and then you have the rest that aren't it's like Okay cool so it's like an overall skill and Vibe thing generally speaking um and or what else can we do which is just increase show rates from a tech perspective it's like increase show rates add more consumption try and do these things to get them higher quality uh and then on the media buying Facebook side it's like what can we do to like optimize better for the right type of person um and do that so yeah so that's the general gist um technically I can go like crazy in depth on how the 2.0 of this is basically having all of this data live within a live updating database that then you can query across and do formulas and do all stuff I personally hate HubSpot forms I are uh reporting I literally hate it um some people love it I just am not a fan I use this sometimes when I need to I think it's sheet go I think it's this one yeah I use one of these that is a tool for HubSpot database to push into sheets that's a real-time live updating and that is like Game Changer so I will take like the contact table inside HubSpot and have it live updating and only select the ones I Want For What I'm trying to track and what's important to a certain team or like deliverable or kpi and I'll push it to Sheets because it's so much better for me to do like formulas and across and like ranges and auto update than it is for me to do HubSpot reporting but over time you're going to want this in a live place that like you see your lead flow not in a sheet but you see it in your CRM and like but then how do you tie it back to ad cost so you need ad cost wherever that same location is the place so you can marry all this all this information uh we use looker studio uh for sales team for commissions for um coaching for like a couple these different pieces we haven't fully fledged into some pieces it's just like the important stuff and everything else I build in these still as long as the data is live updating somewhere this is just a viewer so it's like you can use whatever tool you want but if if I can fin angle this and change it and make it so we can make better decisions which is the whole point not for it to be sparkly and shiny it's like to drive Behavior to make better decisions and drive Behavior so for a sales team yes you want sparkly and live updating with you know fireworks and stuff when something happens and competition and all that for an operations thing I need accurate data to make better decisions doesn't need to you know motivate and and and like be sparkly um so yeah that's G just this I need uh comments on what else you guys want cuz I have like a ton of just random things that I'm just going to start going through and I just figured this one would be helpful based on yesterday's video talking about the math and I will be very interested to see like I said yesterday was very theoretical in terms of low ticket stuff I have some math on it the parts I don't have are like that Setter math and like I could have a 20% set rate instead of a 60 and all that so I'm excited to see how it plays out and then give you guys updates on what the actual math backed out to but this is going to be helpful if you don't have one of these and again Pro tip do it with the whole company it's the same methodology think systematically and you need all the money coming in and you need all the money coming out in there and then do it on day and then do it by category and then you can do cash flow statements you can do all the same stuff and I can go into those in future videos if that's of interest to people I just have to build them out cuz showing ours gives private information so that's what I got today sorry if it sound like this I'm sick but we keep going so talk soon

# $30M call funnel: ad spend, sales, profit. | E6
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihwlc0MbaZA

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through some simple info bism that we used to do 30 million in cash collected last year through one single call funnel all right so I'll go through what we used um some of the variances and some of the numbers and then what we're planning to do into the future so first things first what I have here is I'm essentially doing this per unit so per new client so just to do that instead of having everything up from cost per click down and trickling I'm just trying to simplify this I pulled this together this morning um so cost per lead so let's say you're getting a $20 cost per lead and again this funnel is uh optin so lead application after watching a vssl and doing consumption booking getting on the phone with the sales rep getting on zoom and then purchasing okay so first things first is we're going to say we have a $20 cost per lead now how many of those leads are then going to become an application so let's say and for us let's call it rough numbers uh 20% okay so then your cost per app is going to be $100 right now how many of those people people go fill out a full 16 177 question application like they do with us and then end up booking a call right so this has a lot of factors actually um so you can you can basically make it like super low friction so as soon as someone's done it just lands and it's like now you do schedule your call you can frame it on the application side that you're applying for the call right and there's a lot of ways to get around or kind of get this percentage up higher um we've had it 67 I mean we've had it really high before um but for us what we actually wanted to do was add friction there so if you look on ours for example this is probably helpful if I just do this as we go too so for us instead of just you know putting this here and then just putting the widget we actually try and like pre-frame them a ton which is um it it detracts right it like makes it so less people book in um and we do that because we want only qualified people and it's more of like we don't want more volume we want more qualified volume not just like raw volume um so for us let's just call this 50 % on here another thing that we do is routing so if there's routing uh of DQ people where you can uh disqualify this number could be 40 it could be 45 it could be 30 um depending so all these numbers are very malleable but like let's just call it uh let's just call 45 for this so that'll have your cost per booking actually 50 just for quicker math um so your cost per booking is going to be 200 and that's pretty realistic and I don't want to directly show CU we have so many stats on that sheet that I have but this is rough uh about what we're at cost per live call now how many people are actually going to show up on that call this is another thing I have other videos on show rates um currently we have actually terrible show rates this is very candid Channel I don't really care about lying or guring you but like our show rates right now are 45 to 50% we changed a bunch of automations we had like malicious bad stuff ranking on Google that didn't make any sense that was incorrect information that were getting taken down uh we changed up something with Google branded search like Perfect Storm um so they're like 45 but steady they have been 50 5% um and that's what I'm use for this and that's not unrealistic at all um when you start to getting like 60 and 70 and whatever percent from a direct booking that's kind of like out of my range unless you have some hormos style where then all of these numbers go down and all of these numbers go up because you have some crazy offer um but for us just saying like with current state and where we're at um so I'll get you $364 to have someone on the phone okay now how many of those close let's call it 15% okay so in that model you have 15% of the live calls you're taking this is generally and like when crushing closer to 20% all right so just there just on the marketing side right for one unit it's costing you $1,800 and this is assuming at scale and all these things right um you could be selling two units and you could be sell and have spent $2,000 in ads and have one unit or you could sell and I'll get into that later like how many units in the breakdown but this is just for One Singular unit okay now new cash just dragged something um so new cash aov 7,000 okay so different people have different offers let's call it 3,000 right and this is where math starts to get crazy like if you don't have a high enough aov on this and and for aov I'm talking new cash collected not Revenue not any of that just like literally Blended if you sold 10 units some use pay plans some use full pay whatever pick that actual dollar value that's the aov that is the average amount that we that you collected on the new Cash There's retention numbers there's future P there's all this kind of stuff but just using the uh front cash in terms of having month-over-month cash flow in one snapshot okay so aov 7gs okay now sales commissions this is also highly debated and back and forth so for us we have W2 employees for the longest time we had contractors but because we're building for future scale exit all that kind of stuff we moved everyone in house um back and forth on if this was going to idea uh just direct cost it's 20% higher just like out of the box um so if you're paying someone $110,000 it's 12 or it's $12,000 now um and that's just in all the US tax structure and all that kind of um or tax system and how all that works so let's call this 12% what this doesn't include is managers so I have other models and stuff where I break out the management of the these but like for this snapshot again this is just going to be like per unit and then cost to fulfill cost to uh sales cost and ads all those pieces and then the gross margin is then what hits overhead and you could classify the managers as overhead and those kind of pieces um but just for a simplified model of this so your uh sales commission 12% so sales reps is going to make on average $8,400 call it and again this maybe goes up because there's bonus pools because there's if they hit different thresholds and toggles and whatever uh we're going to use it at 12 because for ours it is basically this is very close um to what ours is and we're constantly not constantly changing it but we we've gone through phases of changing it over time um fulfillment cost so hormos has a good number so I'm just going to throw it in here as 20% this is not what ours is um just based on the new structure of how we have things performance uh retention numbers stuff like that that play into it that are more important for us on kpis to drive solid fulfillment um all right so it's 20% so what you have here is your cost per client I just brought down this ad so it's actually add cost per client just so not get confusing or OCD is going to kill me um all right so cost per client on the ads you're spending $1,800 to collect $7,000 on ads you're then paying a coach 8.40 you're paying a uh I'm sorry you're paying a sales rep 840 and then you're paying your coach 1400 okay so that gross margin left over is about $3,000 for every new unit of 7K now this does not account for excuse me um this does not account for refunds this does not account for uh multitude of things um again this is just overview math but call that 5% call that whatever number um and then do your math accordingly because this is like really really important um napkin math uh but so that's 42% gross margin now how many units per month so if you're just scaled down and doing you know called 100 so I guess depending on who you are scaled down but 700,000 in new cash which would leave the company 300K to pay managers to pay software to pay other vendors to pay everything owners man like everything uh so you got to really pay attention especially like for us this is one offer one structure nowhere else that we're collecting cash now where else is there Cash There's cash on retention so let's say of these 100 units and we sell an annual program so of these 100 units let's go like really low you have 20% of them um that are going to renew okay so the cost per new client I'm sorry cost per retained I should have done this before but let's just say retention unit is uh let's say it's a 5k renewal because we have different things like that and then what is the cost on that the cost for the coach only right so because your cost per coach is the only cost you're going to have on the back end so your net on retention is going to be right so you're going to have an 80% margin I just want to show you the actual math I understand that that wasn't that difficult to math but right so you're going to have 4,000 now let's say 20% of those are renewing I'm literally just going to rip this real quick all right so 20% of these would be 20 of them at yeah so that would be 80k let's call it right there that you'd have in net retention dollars in terms of the the gross that would actually come back to the company um but it would actually be 100,000 right um because 20 new units on this assuming that so this is where a lot of the money is made for a lot of these guys um um so if you can keep the customer past the initial period whether it's a six-month program a 3-month program an annual program like we do um this is where like the real money's made because you don't pay for a sales rep because you don't pay for ads again once you have them in the system so this is another thing for like Ascension so a lot of people have masterminds or higher ticket things so in this example I used a lower ticket thing because we're selling 7K for the first year but for us a lot of the time um a coach will have or a client will have you know basically gotten the gist through that and they want to stay in for Community for accountability um that piece of it uh for the longest time we did I mean we still technically do it at basically the same rate just like $1,000 down so very very close but a lot of them had gotten in at that initial pricing and then since then we have raised pricing on the front end um but then we'll do twice a year special that's 5K so I just use that as an example uh for retention only so just another example but all the say 42% now let's mess with the numbers let's say and just to be so candid and just try and be like as real as possible with everyone here um so let's say you crank this up and do like 400 units which is where we were at uh when we were at total scale and again to be blunt we have scaled down since and I can kind of get into that in other videos um but we're rebuilding now up in a more structurally sound maybe way instead of just ramping from 10 million to 30 million in one year which is what we did um so the units per month uh 400 so that would give you 2.8 and then it drop 1.17 now why this is important is if you're in a position like us so I just kept everything exactly the same which again at scale does not happen at scale let's just say quick is your freaking your cost per lead goes to here and all of a sudden you lose 10% gross margin okay just by jumping to a $27 lead and again it could be anywhere in this step it could be your cost per booking it could be the quality that comes through which then you have to go back and then you're changing out lead because really what would happen is your cost per lead would stay the same but all of a sudden your close rate could be like let's just say everything I'll stay the same but the lead quality just tanks close rate is 10% bad bad okay so this is important to know like every single section of this and also to be able to diagnose what's happening because you constantly need to have a pulse on what's Happening so like we have automated trackers for all of these things so we can see day over day we can see week over week month over month uh quarter year and then in comparison to and then we have basically like a like a notes log tracker of like what changed when if we roll out new stuff in ads if we were testing something in Landers we're doing splits something like that and then majority of that stored in HubSpot and sheets as well to track these but why this is important I keep going on tangent sorry but why this is important is because let's say you are staffed up like us and you have 110 W2 employees who are all making base including sales reps including whatever but your volume is half your booking calendar 30% um your unit just so your units fall to like 100 you are now only bringing 300K so like here in units your margin is to the same or I'm sorry here in this like model per unit your margin stays the same so you're still bringing 42% back to the company cool right not cool because now you're only bringing 294 Grand to the company on a monthly basis and what if your payroll is 500 Grand or your softwares or your this or your that right like that is where this becomes an issue and I don't want to say something like we didn't think about because we always we always were pretty proactive about this but like at what number is break even more or less in terms of like net of the company um yeah that was a dance so once you get 250 once you get into 400 how much money is coming back to the company and staying there and then how much is your overhead how much as your overhead as a percentage some of these people are kpi so theirs does like for example like a sales manager a Setter manager stuff like that they're directly tied to the new cash so like their over their portion overhead decreases or increases with the new cash cash that comes in great who's doesn't um marketing generally speaking there's this kind of kpi but not really um the head guys but not like the actual just like boots on the ground um the Cs team not at all the tech team not at all the right like the all these people have like flat pays um that and then sales rep same thing like I just said when we moved everyone to W2 uh everyone has bases so if you're only filling calendars 30% people are still getting the base the federal minimum or whatever they're State minimum that they make so call it 40 grand 50 60 depending on the state of what they can legally make so for the minimum they can make unless you have them on hourly then it's this whole other Gambit so instead of salary but all right so that is current state or basically this is what the model we ran at right here okay and again these numbers are roughish like app to lead could be 15% app to lead could be 25% cost per lead 20 is pretty accurate but like I have I have math going back to like 20 23 was $9 but our aov was like $1,500 and there was no cost fulfill because we were selling an info product so that's another piece like if you have this same model so is that right 25 yeah now let's say your cost to fulfill is zero so this is where you start to uh hear about or like very marginal I call like two so a lot of these guys will do group coaching that's like wider and um Iman gazi has a good video where he talks about this where he did 70% margin on like 70 million which is like nowhere near what we did in margin in dollars yes but in margin no um and that's due to two things that in my opinion that is the acquisition cost because of so much organic and all that kind of brand builtup and then also the cost to fulfill is not 20% on his right well so one in info business in general if you're selling a login or access or group coaching or stuff like that it's either marginal or literally zero um so like you have a kajabi login it's it could be as simple as like kajabi login group coaching Facebook group so you're paying a community manager more or less yes you're pay there are overhead pieces like Cs and stuff like that um but you're paying Community manager and then you're paying like group coaches Andor you you are the group coach that is in there and it's what's your time worth but like in true cash what does it cost very very little um so if you have that kind of model where you have like a 2% here and then you know just for to make this easy on the math your cost per lead is like $3 instead like that is where you start to get into crazy behavior because you get 82% on the front end unit and then on the back you still run lean and it costs you know another 10% and you're keeping 50 to 70% of the of new cash of all cash um so yeah so that's just not the model we've run on everything for us has been paid we do have a strong organic presence but like if you hos it and track like where it actually comes from it's used for nurture and and proof of product and like actual you know that we are real business and stuff like that uh more so than it is I mean definitely more so than it is for cold I mean we get sub five sub two whatever percent of the new purchases originate from organic uh and that's probably just because we haven't done a good job prioritizing it or doing correctly um but yeah we are at somewhat on the hamster wheel of constantly having to acquire customers other than dialing in this attention and this is current state so how long am I oh man I'm already at 60 minutes sorry all right V2 this is where we are headed and this is what we are testing so again this is all hypothetical I know I've seen people do this I know the math works I know that also actually executing on it has not occurred to be candid no guru so now let's say this model is running low ticket at scale okay so you're going to have uh cost per low ticket and there's again there's stuff above this it's cost per click it's the two-step a lot of people do on order form so it's percentage of people that go from front end to order form it's then order form aov like it's all these different pieces this is a simplified way that'll still work I still show you what I mean um so cost per low ticket so let's say it is the cost per low ticket to acquire one is $60 okay and again this is going to change dramatically if you're selling a $9 product or if you're selling a $150 product or if you're selling whatever but just for simplification and what I'll use and these are basically the example of what we're actually using so $60 uh I'm not going to fill this in yet just show you so the set Call To Low ticket so for us the Otto and what a lot of these guys do the post-p purchase Otto is actually schedule your implementation call now there's a different frame and we currently do this for closers which is not good because it goes into a closer but the frame of the call is like schedule your implementation call that comes with the low ticket then you just bought completely different frame than someone who's applying in to basically figure out what war VIP is cost and stuff like that so now we're rolling out a Setter team as of this week um so March 2025 um going to give it a go so these will actually book with Setters as implementation calls and then the whole point there is basically vet them get them up to speed help them where they need and then push them into a call with the closer so Setter call to this so historically we've actually just booked these with Setters or I'm sorry with closers and it's been like 40 something percent uh it's been like 45 40% now they're not speed deleting them they're not uh doing outbound dials to them they're not like all of these things so I'm pretty confident that like we could get this 50% % let's call it all right now set call percentage this is going to completely vary and this is kind of like shot out of a cannon I'm not 100% sure um but let's say the set for uh the set call is of that again this is going to be higher so this going to be 60% I'm banking on uh now how many of those then get set let's call it 40% uh closer call show now in the last one I said it was 55 and that is direct ad book raw so all the automations all the amazing things we have that get us there but now we're introducing it went through a Setter directly who found the time on their calendar went back and forth and vetted the person so for this let's call it 70% which should be fantastic and then the ratio of the close rate is now you're not talking to someone who watched an ad at 8:00 p.m. on their couch booked a call for the next morning and then just got on okay so that's going to hurt show rates that's going to hurt close rates that's going to hurt everything so let's say this is a 25% close okay aov same 7,000 sales commission same 12% now there's a Setter commission that did not exist before let's call that 3% fulfillment cost same thing we're going to put that at 20% all right so in this math now so on our last one is this right gross margin where did I change cool all right so in this now your gross margin is essentially the same right so just with these costs here it's going to cost you $60 to get a buyer it's going to cost you $100 to get someone on the phone with a Setter it's going to cost you 250 to get them on with the closer of the people who show again I think this will be higher too personally um Clos rate could be higher especially if we can already achieve 20% sometimes uh steady steady state we haven't but like 20% um so this will keep your uh I'm sorry so call cost per live live cost per live closer call would be 333 and cost per new client is $1,300 new cash same cost per client and ads variable cost these would stay the same we now added cost because we added a Setter so we have 210 so we net out at 3200 okay so that is 45 46% margin basic on p with over here now where this changes is when you're selling a product which is what this is this does not account for having the low ticket dollars liquidating so right now we're selling something that has a $37 aov okay so all I'm doing here is I'm going to take out that aov from the cost per low ticket to get you a net okay so instead of it direct costing $60 to get this person what it really costs I mean what really cost $60 but uh in ads but it cost $60 in ads but then you got back $37 of it all right so in that model your net cost per uh to acquire someone was 23 so you're not fully liquidating you're not making money on the front end you're not any of that kind of stuff you're just making it cost less for every action that happens after that fact okay so $38 for a Setter call then 96 and look at the comparables on this like as it goes down the track all the way down to having 57% margin let's go back to our 400 units a month example so you're picking up another 800 bucks for these and I didn't fully flush this out as to like where the new cash would come with low ticket and like because you technically have like in a quick example like a 4% Ascension rate from low ticket so you would have sold 100 of these to close four units or 25 to sell one unit quick math there but uh I can pledge this out as we actually do this this is all hypothetical completely hypothetical what could happen here is this could be $100 and it could be an increase but not a crazy increase but still at scale fantastic right and the big thing here is this number that's dropping to the bottom line obviously because then that fuels the rest of the team make sure that all that's covered and then actual true profit so by no means is this like the I mean it is kind of like not necessarily Cash Cow in terms of that but you dial this in and get this like aov up you get cost per this down you get all of these like you know you can play this game a lot of ways but you can get a lot of these down a a lot of these up and make more money okay uh fulfillment cost is not 20 this around right this around right aov you can increase and sell more these are the toggles that like I focus on a lot of the time okay and then other big thing is retention numbers that will then add on to this so if you have 45 on the front and can push 50 on the front and then also have 80% on the back and have a retention engine which I'm already at like 20 something minutes so I'm going to stop but that's a behemoth and then if you can do this at scale that's how all these big guy like I know two different companies currently that are doing over 10 million a month 100 million a year so actually 120 a year um that are doing this model a little different here with like set or call and forc whatever but they're selling a low ticket or more more so they're selling a direct to cart so they're selling 2750 $2,000 product upfront direct to cart meaning they can buy it on their own and then doing basically our business model on the back so this whole time we've been running basically the back end business business model and why it's so can get so constrained is because if the acquisition goes wonky and all of a sudden your cost per acquisition is $3,000 instead of 1,500 or whatever like you're digging into a a deep red hole okay and it's not ideal and coming from experience of when we had marketing blow up and then CPA was crazy high and then you scale down but then marketing uh isn't filling calendars and then you do fill calendars but then sales reps aren't closing because of bad vibes like it's it's constantly figuring something out and because we have been on One Source One flow one funnel it is like ex like the the magnifying glass is just on so what we're trying to do now is mitigate that through multiple traffic sources multiple offers we have multiple brand faces and then all funneling back to the back end which is essentially our current entire company in terms of sales fulfillment CS all that so keeping the whole coaching piece as the the back end with just with higher margins on the per unit and then attempting to liquidate and just overall brand awareness way up by going direct response heavy so these other guys that do 120 million both all of them do uh or both of them in the example I'm using are doing whatever call five six million or something on the front on the front being in these low ticket things unknown on how much to spend in ads but you got to assume it's that is is so maybe they are making a little money maybe they're losing a little bit of money whatever but then all the money the big money is made in the back on the coaching because you're selling something that's 7K 8K 15K on the back and your acquisition cost has been liquidated either partially or fully um so yeah this is just common practice these are just examples of or numbers that for us are pretty real like especially these um again there's some variants in a lot of these for us and it can go it can change month over month um but I just want to give kind of sneak peek view into what we did what we're moving towards or attempting to move towards and our goal is to continue to run this mod or I'm sorry this model like at the same time almost as we do this and then just hyper Focus so the people who are ready to buy are going direct through um the higher ticket who are like ready for coaching than the people who are going through it's more of a mass Market play especially with us with 46y old women in this business uh so yeah so that's kind of the general gist and again none of this is Guru you know this is oh this is the way to do it exactly by any means there are people who do like I just said 70% margins on the entire business and the math I just showed is 30 or 40% on the unit before overhead so like there's a lot of ways to do this if you're trying to make two three five million bucks then there's a simpler way likely than having 110 employees and a bunch of different structural things and team meetings and W2 and HR managers and all that and like constant ad flow and if you don't hit your quota in terms of marketing things then there's no new unit and like this Downstream effect like there's a lot of mov Parts here and it can be very focused in so there's a lot of ways to make a buck and not to say this is the one just showing what we did and what we're currently doing so thank you everyone droping in comments anything I have kind of a running list of just random ideas that I'm making these videos daily as of now uh until I run out of ideas um but yeah let me know if you guys want anything specific or are curious about anything drop in the comments bye

# Our TEAM made $30M last year. Here is a breakdown... | E5
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxYseIDT0Y4

What's up everybody? All right, so today I'm going to go through the org chart that we used to do $30 million last year in 2025 cash collected. Um, and then I'm just going to go through kind of where it was, where we're at now, uh, and what our plan is. And again, this channel is basically just what we've done, what has worked, what hasn't worked, and just try to figure all that out and document it so I can look back in a few years and laugh or just see kind of what has changed. So, all right, starting with marketing over here. So, this is our new setup. So, to be blunt, this is not what we have been operating on. So the plan here for where we're going is way more direct response heavy. So being direct response heavy, we need more page builders. We need more copy. Uh we need more graphics than we have in the past. So we actually up until now have not even had a CMO. Um so the other one of the founders, one of the other owners is very very strong in marketing and sales. Um and he has been basically acting as CMO as well as CEO. I didn't put kind of that on here. Owners and CMO or uh CEO, but he's been acting as this this entire time and was doing all the media buying up until like 20K day uh and beyond. So very very involved in this because it's his it's his like superpower, his strength. So if you watch a lot of Hormosi stuff like at a certain point you are the best up until XYZ, but like he could get really really far um because he's so talented at it. So big benefit there that we had. Um but up until so the new structure is going to be graphic designer, Google media buyer, media uh meta media buyer and then they technically have like a secondary person that's in there running with them. Um copywriter which is everything email as well as um so like scripting emails and then um just basically like on page stuff that we need depending and then creative director. This overlooks for us currently all organic and paid uh creative. So, manages all of the actual um creative itself, not the distribution necessarily, but um all that portion and then has an editor that does all of the creative both for ads as well as organic videos. Um a little less in the organic for us currently, but and then page builder is someone who can build inside ClickFunnels, web flow, all those things, whatever your tech stack is to make things that are consistent, brand oriented across. So, this is where we're at right now. This is everyone we have more or less on the team now that we're looking to take this to nine figures a year or more. Um, and there will be more. There'll likely be a project manager in here. There'll likely be some other pieces as we have more offers, but in current state up until now, we've only had one main offer. So, what we have had, uh, I'm just going to delete out of this as we go. So, we had Google buyer, we had media buyer, we had a copywriter, uh, creative director and editor. These are kind of newer. And then page builder didn't exist. So, I built all the pages. That's why they're so ugly. Um, so I would just funnel hack people. I'm not a designer. Um, so I built all the pages. Luke more or less built um the other founder build the um all of the copy and offers and stuff like that and we kind of go back and forth on that. I build all the pages, I build all the tracking, uh all the setups there, all the splits, any dashboarding, any of that kind of stuff. Um and then we'd run them and then either he was running media or uh these guys were running media on it. So that's the general setup. Um tech side of things. So I'm like technically CTO. So I do CTO and then more or less like strict I don't even know you want to call it like executive ops. So basically uh managing this the operations level team um in one meeting and just making sure that all departments are across here all the numbers across the entire company uh all the KPIs, dashboards, all that kind of stuff as well as like project lists. Um we have really strong leads in this way. So there's not really like micromanaging level at all that happens where sales runs sales, product and people runs people, marketing runs marketing. Um, and I'm just kind of like interwoven in a bunch of these. Um, but I have a senior tech lead. I've talked about this in other videos who is like a killer in terms of automations and stuff like that. Not so much custom code getting in that direction. Um, and I can have other videos where we go into like continue education stuff. We got him in uh like a development developer program. Uh, learned a bunch of stuff around like actual more custom coding than just plugging things together with automations. Um, but he builds all of our AI and custom tech and stuff like that. Um, and then tech support. is a huge one. This is been since like employee number 10 maybe. Um so I did it for a really long time, but it's 11 p.m. and someone can't get in their email and you're resetting passwords and you know you're out and stuff like that. So we got a tech sport that's a VA um technically a team of VAS but act as one inside our Slack channel and they do all things for setups, onboards, uh anything that's like techreated in that way and then any SOP related stuff. So um creative director or I guess copywriter creates a new script gets it to creative director goes to brand face other founder who's a rockstar um and she records it comes back to creative director editor uh edits it long form organic video for example podcast episode um then she will then post it then it'll go over in SOP then goes to tech support she'll put it on the website she'll put it in all the places do all the right tagging then it goes back to copywriter and then it gets sent out via email, all that kind of stuff, right? So, um yeah, so that's kind of the tech department right now. And then I still act as like all of the tracking and all the setups on all the new builds. So, I am working currently to get out of that, but because we've only had one offer, it's not really like a continuous thing. Um for me personally, like I my strength is more so in I do the buildouts, anything like that, but anything that's recurring, it's like the most painful thing in the world to me. So uh we're currently working to see amongst his current team as well as we have an external service provider that uh we're looking that will do buildouts and then basically provide SOPs to team. So they would come in and say uh you know here's the new sixstep ClickFunnel setup. They'll build all the tracking and they'll build all the data that pulls from all the right steps and then log them in and what date uh what type of data fields or custom fields inside the CRM what triggers what what does all that and then we would manage it thereafter. Right? Right. So instead of me doing all that portion, they can do that heavy lifting and then uh just for like the onetime setups and then building everything dynamic. So when we do splits, when we do all that, the reporting just stays and you can see uh across. So sales, so this is the like new setup. So for us, this is acting as the same person right now. Um because we hired a sales director in and then we've tried setters in the past and it never worked for us. We didn't maybe didn't have the right person, didn't have the right setup, just something just didn't work for us when we tried to do it last time. Um, so what we have operated as, so again, so this is where we're going. So we just, this starts is March of 2025. We just brought in a setter manager. It starts this week. They're bringing in setters. So this is going to be a new function. Um, but thus far, we have had none. Um, and then this is really what acts right now. So we have a closer manager, which is really our sales director. Um, but because we scaled down because kind of where we're at, we're just looking at this is like this person is wearing both hats uh in Kurate. And then all the closers, we got up to 30 or so closers at one point. So the closers actually broke out and there was I could add to this, but there was there was pods. So basically we had 15 and 15 in each one. So you had like one of the sales uh reps that then was also a pod leader. So they could have their own dedicated meetings. So you don't have 30 people on one meeting trying to do management and like uh oneonone connection and stuff like that. Uh and then a sales uh operations manager, sales coordinator, which is basically um in here doing all the details and kind of like holding people accountable, making sure the stats are on um just providing like a ton of support to the sales team different than the director who's doing the oneto ones, who's doing the cadence, uh who's leading the meeting, stuff like that. So again, this is what we had. I can delete this cuz I made this for this video and took out everyone's names. Uh so this is what basically we have been operating as. I mean, and again, it's really been this for 30 million a year was this. Uh, not to say that's the best way to do it. And again, this is just like how we did it. Um, but yeah, this this is how we did up to, you know, 3.8, I believe, last year was our our peak month. And then since we've scaled down, I can do other videos on how like the evolution of this, but we basically had like three big upticks as we just like ramp into it. Um, the last one was the 10 million to 30 and then right now we're like scaled down again. um just restructuring getting in there because if costs go out of whack, you're just making a bunch of topline or cash collected to not keep it if things are like out of whack. So if your cost per acquisition goes up double or something across that range or you set up comp plans wrong or there's too much waste or something, then you know you're doing the same profit dollars on a higher revenue number. It's just like vanity. Um which, you know, we're not here for anymore. And at maybe at a certain point we were, but the goal is not that anymore. It's true bottom, true profit dollar. So, um, all right. And this is kind of like, uh, this is on fulfillment, so not so much really what this channel has been about or what it's really going to be about. Um, because this is like company specific, uh, especially like phone coaching. Like we're in fitness, for example. So, this is going to look a little different on actual fulfillment, especially on like tech and those videos. But, um, just overall, so CBO, this is uh, chief of people and kind of chief of product. Um, but the title is chief of people. um absolute rockstar in our company. So this is like literally the this person we could not hire external. We could not find someone intern like no one could do this role better than the person we have. So again this whole thing is all about just the people like if you have the right people on the team then it doesn't matter. I mean it does but like you'll figure out how to get it done. So chief of people absolute rockstar came up in the company from I yeah to be basically being a coach leading all the coaches over here in chief of people was doing like an operator role for a minute but we all realized it's like best for that their zone of genius is in the people and the understanding of that as well as the product delivery so moved into this I should make a video on this on like how the actual chunks and evolution not just an overview but we're here now so um she leads this so we have an HR manager because everyone on this entire thing except some of the some of them are contractors like a few for like siloed positions but we wanted to move into a more structurally sound and like long-term vision and that was moving everyone to W2. So we have an HR manager and have 105 people or something like that uh or five team right now that are W2 employees in the US. So benefits 401k all the jazz. So costs instantly 20% up. I don't know that I would recommend it or when I would recommend it to someone. uh you do need to do it for compliance at a certain point, but if you ever have dips in cash collected as we did and this is me sharing, you know, what we learned like it it hurts because you have everyone who's in base salaries, you know, you have sales reps that are no longer just draw that are just, you know, 10% or whatever your commission numbers are. It is you're paying them no matter what across these ranges and everyone for that matter. Um so yeah, your floor goes up and then just your general cost. If you were paying 100K every two weeks in payroll, now you're paying 120 rough numbers. Um, but yeah, so and our numbers are far higher than that. So, HR manager, uh, CS manager, ours is a rockstar here. So, the, uh, CS manager overlooks the CS reps, which are going to be, um, in all the email combos, and we do onboarding calls for all the clients. So, they do all the onboarding, uh, calls before they get over to their coach for the actual fulfillment of the product. So, it's like sales rep to CS rep to coach. uh a billing admin who just lives inside of our Stripe and managing the data and making sure that things are marked as new when people do PIFFs um you know custom payment plans all that kind of stuff uh renewals and then also manages uh all of the emails that come in so all of the customer support emails um because a lot of them are billing oriented almost all of them um and then community we have community manager that does both the we have two groups as of now that we've had that do we have like a free group that's included in the emails and you know for the low ticket and stuff when we tested in the and uh the paid group which is or the you know VIP community group which is our high ticket uh coaching community. So yeah, that is them that live in CS. Uh premier coaches, we have three I believe right now. I think we at one point we're up to four or five um that overlook the rest of the coaches. Um this is in the fitness specific coaching. So these are onetoone coaches with clients. Each coach will have you know ramp up but will then sit around 50 to 75 or so um clients per coach. And these are also W2 employees. So they have 401k benefits security in that way. Um and again rockstar coaches and you guys can see on the site and stuff they have every accreditation and thing you can have. So yeah and that's the structure. So I'm sure I am u missing a small chunk but then operationally CS manager, sales manager, sales director, chief of people, CTO, CMO and CEO which I didn't throw on here but just basically overarching. So we are all the ones that sit in the operations meeting. We'll have a once a week and I'll go I'll have another video again where I go over like meeting cadence and stuff like that. But that's the operations meeting that we'll have once a week and everyone is basically breaking down their chunk. What are their goal? Where's the goal at? Uh what are the projects that are within this? Are they hitting KPIs and this uh across each section department and then a lot of the time in any company uh you can just easily identify like you know uh for example calendars are booked half and the rest of the company is downstream affected that. So it's like okay at some level like what's the one big thing? What's the one main thing that we can focus on? That's like how can the rest of the departments you know continue to do their thing but almost proactively try and help the bottleneck right now which is marketing for example. So can CS pull a bunch of reviews that we can use because that'll get more social proof and that'll work. Uh can sales start hitting the pipeline harder and start to lean into outbound more uh of the CRM because the bookings aren't coming in direct from marketing. um can t figure out automations and flows to make it so we can squeeze the people that are coming in and get a higher percent of lead to app or lead to booking or whatever for example. Um so yeah or same thing with tech um or actually not same thing with tech that one's a little harder not really not as easy to come in and help but like same thing with sales uh automation so we can come into here uh renewals that we can do on the product side to make it so revenue stays up across this uh as we scale through or as we scale through like the rougher times. So yeah, this is the general gist. And again, um I can make a better video on like here's where it was at this point, here's where it was at this point, here's where it was, and then here's where it is, right? Because we've like refined, but we've also we're getting a little bit wider. Um but we're refined. And then same thing with comp plans gets crazy, but um a lot of these are more fixed positions, fixed positions, commission based like kind of scaled positions. um quantity or like volume, so like how many clients you have, style you can increase uh pay, and then uh more or less fix. And then each one do have like their own little versions of bonus pools um depending on how close they are to the customer and how close they are to like what they can manage. Um and then these basically are all performance driven, like hard like leaning way heavier in performance driven. Um, so yeah. So, uh, I will update this as we go and get kind of further into this. Uh, so far I've basically just shared videos on the funnel and kind of some of the like stuff behind the funnel and how it was structured and how we did there. But I want to get more into like what we're doing now and what's working. Maybe like week update because right now it's like March 2025. We're hiring CMO or our CMO just started officially. Uh, center manager starting officially. 19 other fun updates. But yeah, I don't really know how to share these in a good clean way, but figured this would be helpful and more of like a operation structural view of it, not just, hey, here's our marketing pages and kind of how the flow works. So yeah, I will continue to make these and if you have any questions, Instagram's probably best. And talk soon.

# The Tech Stack Behind a $70M Call Funnel (Tools We Use) | E4
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7os4coBvW0s

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the call funnel Tech stack that we use to do 70 million through one funnel uh what this channel is is essentially me just sharing what we've done what's worked for us what has not worked for us and what we're currently doing now um so this is the stack that we used first things first is any of these work for anything you can use four different crms and they'll still work you can use four different website hosting platforms and they still work um so it really is specific to you I just want to go through what's worked for us so no guru no fluff this is just what we did and what we're currently doing in March of 2025 and hopefully I'll be able to document and show kind of as we evolve throughout this and go into the nine figure range and what we're using then so for now uh automations what we use right now is zapier and I'm doing this in private so I can ideally just show you guys just all the homepages of the sites but so we use zaps uh a lot of people use make nowadays we've done it for some stuff but this has just been the easiest in all honesty we kind of built this thing duct tap together um so one piece at a time since then we have you know two and a half million zaps a month that fire now uh some craziness there but this is what we use for almost everything still to this day we have since moved a bunch of it to custom um so we have a bunch of stuff that's like web hook dra and we have an our database but overall everything's still on zap all right websites I have another video on the channel that's about this uh initially we started on clickfunnels then moved to WordPress not.com but you know what I mean so we started on click funnel that's where we did the first whatever few hundred thousand probably actually over a million um then we moved to Wordpress not.com but.org self-hosted um and then we would do we did that because we wanted more content consumption the blog functionality stuff like that where clickfunnels at that point was just 1.0 so they didn't offer the um kind of like content consumption model the homepage the navigation stuff like that and then just recently we moved to web flow in the beginning of 2025 just because we wanted it for the design and we really just needed an overhaul um it's my understanding that we could have just rebuilt uh completely from scratch on web on WordPress and gotten the same result uh I'm a big fan of Wordpress I use it on other companies and other sites but we want to move to web flow for the design just kind of out of the box functionality and we still use devs for that but that's essentially the stack that we've used for website and we do have all of our funnels on the root domain on webflow as well uh we still use clickfunnels for low ticket and we use clickfunnels for uh order forms which is kind of funny U but we still do use those video hosting um wistia is what we used forever and then now we use a lot of Vidics so vitic is more like direct response oh I don't want this to log me in I just want to be able to show you guys baltics is going to be more of your direct response copy so the videos you see that look like this if you're using video where it has like you can opt in Prior we actually don't use any of these functionalities but we're going to see a video this just going to have a pop and it's going to basically auto play it can have a um sped up bar on the bottom so it'll like go quickly in the beginning and then stop it can have these optin um ctas that pop up bunch of different stuff uh but this is much better for direct response so we use this for all of our mobile vsls and then we are moving over to all of our desktop vsls so like if you look here you'll see um like this is wistia hey babe because we're silly and we still do that um but this is training this is Wisa I'm going to show this is vitic I'm going to show you how the worst physical pain of my so like that sticky bar like that the no open so when CTA pops they're not inside the uh on mobile have it full screen um so there's a lot of benefits to this it's actually kind of probably not smart of us to still have wistia but we are moving over um but just go to show you can do it on anything um you could email people a video and you could make $100 million so that's what we video for CRM we use HubSpot um HubSpot before when we first started this we use clothes personally I like clothes a lot I just think it's leaner and it's like so if you're just starting off um I think clothes has a really really good job you can store a lot of the data it's really good for just pipelines communication all the communication in there was tracked really easily which was nice because in HubSpot there's like differences with you have to send an email from within HubSpot for it to be tracked within HubSpot versus close uh at least in the past just like 2A sync with your entire Gmail so for all your sales reps any messaging anything that could come into support would all be in one thread which was really nice versus HubSpot kind like breaks it out but again it just kind of depends on what you're looking for um lot people use go high level for a lot of things I personally I've used it for like white labeling but when it comes to actually using it for like one specific business and just yours I am not a fan I like kind of having Silo tools that are the best at what they do not one tool that does everything does everything because you can't really be the best at any of them in my opinion um hub spot is what we use we have everything in here so we have like all of these except this I believe and this because we don't use the like website platform they have and like hosting like content marketing here and then this is for like I don't even know what this is for invoice subscriptions we don't use the payments in here we use our own setup um but I'm a huge HubSpot fan a big thing to think about here we had a conversation one time that was like how much do you think it costs us to move from clothes to HubSpot and it was had to have been like half a million dollars an opportunity cost SL like just the just the moving cost alone not the hard cost the amount of like office hours I would host with the entire team to make sure they understood it every single day sales reps the downtime and them not being able to like find deals the same way and move things and know where their pipeline is the migration what gets lost if you have 500,000 contacts and Deals or whatever you're moving over like it's it's a pain so HubSpot supposedly has like a negative churn um which is unreal and it makes sense because for us to move out of there now like they have you by the grass like or yeah by the you know so they have it uh where you like can't leave because where you going to go and even if you do then you have to export everything import everything do this big migration turn all your real- time data like everything is stored in HubSpot for us and we're going even deeper in with data and putting that as our source of truth instead of having custom databases we're likely going to use HubSpot so it's all in one place that's like in progress right now so application um and again sorry these videos are just me riffing just I mean I can in the future probably make things more professional and more you know slide decks and easy explainers this is just me saying what's working saying what we're doing saying what we learned uh going from there so application we use jot form I have love hate relationship with jot form sometimes you have to clear the cash and it breaks but we use it for all the applic for everything on the front end and the back end so the majority of what I'm going over here is just the front end so basically marketing and sales a little bit of fulfillment I'll touch on but mainly uh everything on marketing and sales side because fulfillment is going to change like if you're just doing normal info it's pretty simple stack but if you're doing like frost we're doing Fitness so there's like Fitness specific stuff that I'm not going to go through just cuz it's not as relevant for what I'm trying to build here and like who I'm trying to talk to uh that's more so I'm trying to lean and stay in the Marketing sales business Ops like that kind of side more so than like Fitness specific for running the C scale um so we use jot it's everything on the front end so sales applications then also everything on the back end and fulfillment we use it for reviews check-in forms um all that kind of stuff and then it has custom routing uh so like we have a financial qualifier finally for the first like 290,000 or something like that applications we had we didn't do that and now recently we have so we'll route people to different pages based on things it's in all of them so there's type form um there's a bunch of those but we've only ever used jot since the beginning um and then a lot of guys use custom ones so you'll see like uh some of the bigger guys I don't want to name names but they'll use custom forms they just connect back in the back end cuz same with us it just all pushes in HubSpot and then everything happens in HubSpot after the fact jot form collects it so that's what we use for app uh for booking we still use cly so here we still use cly um I like it there's some features that are missing that schedule once and some of these other ones have or you can like double book people and do stuff um and we'll see if over time we change but as of now we use this for all of the front end and all the Fulfillment side of the team as well um we still use this so we use a little bit of the workflows but mainly everything is just just to C after the booking just to do the calendar invite and then everything reminders and all that I have another video on that but um all of that mainly happens in HubSpot and then connections out of HubSpot so this is really just kind of for the booking widget phones we use lare I'm a big fan uh We've since actually used phones a lot less as of recent yes you can have my cookie checking um we used to only do phone calls so it used to be a 30- minute sales call over the phone up until a year ago maybe and then we moved over to zoom only so we still use them for reminders texts uh like back and forth communication like before um versus email obviously it's going to be a lot faster I do we are testing a blue sending platform right now that we're going to give a go I don't really want to move all the sales reps because we have 20 something 30 something depending on what time of the year uh sales reps that are in there closing and you can only send 50 contacts a day and blah blah blah but so we use alware and it direct connects to HubSpot it links really really easy it has a widget in the corner that pops up I want to show you guys like everything but I don't want to give away sensitive customer info so if I pop open HubSpot I'll be showing you people's phone numbers and messages and stuff like that and I don't feel like that's probably the best bet so um yeah so we use elare and you can do a lot of like power dialer and stuff like that meetings Zoom don't really need to go into that too much but autogenerated and connected through cly and same thing fulfillment and then a cool one that we do use is zoom Revenue accelerator I can't spell this so if you've heard of gong I think it's gong AI this I think it's this yeah so I believe yeah I believe it's this one it's gong AI gong.io one of them um but they essentially are like a conversation intelligence platform so they'll take all of your calls they'll take all of your Zoom meetings they'll take all that stuff and they have like a crazy overlay where they'll basically analyze the calls you'll know what deals one and then it'll be able to tell across all of them what the commonalities are what the script type is all that kind of stuff um so we do some of that custom with our own AI solution um but this is that's like for us it was I don't even remember 55 to 100 grand for us to do it a year with like a three-year agreement so we didn't move on it at the time just cuz the whole goal of getting these softwares is either to you know reduce time um automate things or uh save us money or change behavior and I didn't think it was going to change behavior that much at the time and then Zoom rolled out their own version of it so Zoom basically has one that's built in so obviously only works if you're using Zoom not if you're using phone calls um but for us this was cool and it only cost us like I don't know 1,000 bucks a month or something like that uh to do this so it has scorecards which is like the coolest part this right here um this is like the ratios but they have a where's the scorecard somewhere in here's a scorecard but you basically can say like did the customer uh or I'm sorry did the sales rep build report and it'll say yes or like and you can have 19 questions on the scorecard that gets Auto applied and it'll give you an answer to all of them and tell you yes or no on what scale all that kind of stuff and then also give you the reason why which is huge so it'll be like did they build rapport yes or no and it'll Mark yes and it'll say why I said that or why I think that is because the sales rep talked to him about dogs in the beginning because they were so embarking and they talked about their cute Chihuahua and they went back and forth and then she edified herself or like set the tone and got the authority in the call it's like yes so yes she built Rapport because of this which I think is really cool um it's not something that just exists out of the box in HubSpot or other that are more or less conversation talk time stuff so you know sales rep talked 80% uh the client talked 20% like that's not good right like stuff like that is yeah right there talk time Spiel filler wordss so we use that I like it and it's really good for the sales manager and just it all it also Auto syncs to HubSpot um order forms I already said that one but we use clickfunnels for that still uh I just found it easiest to segment them out and then up multiproducts across them so it is kind of conversome and and we dup them we put their name on it but we have like anop and an automation that already Auto builds them um but it works really well like it just works for what it needs to do so as we move over to HubSpot for all the source of Truth we will likely move order forms finally um processing we use stripe still to this day so we've done again don't want to pop open any dashboards but I should show it at some point um so 70 million in cash collected all through stripe and we have like .02 re uh not refund rate uh dispute rate uh refunds we have like a very liberal policy that's in basically if you're not a good fit if you're upset if you want to get out we just like give you your money back and kick you out of the group uh it just don't have time for that in the community we don't have time for that in the product we don't have time for that in the risk M like the risk of hurting our processing account like it's just not worth it for us um so I heard uh Iman have a really good video about this and he was saying he's like yeah you know we've refunded $4 million or $5 million so I pulled ours up and ours was like seven or n or something like that like we are the same way so he's still runs on stripe we still run on stripe uh you don't really run into issues KN on everything would um we do have a backup processor that's connected to clickfunnels in case there ever was an issue so we do have like a in case of fire uh setup but yeah so currently again all we process is high get payments so everything's through uh an order form and that way through a sales rep not through like direct a card so no one's going in direct purchasing uh it's end of or middle of March right now and we are launching Load Ticket that will be through website through clickfunnels and processing will still be from uh stripe but yeah so dashboarding this one I got to make sure I don't do anything crazy here so we use looker for a lot of stuff and then we use Google Sheets for a lot of stuff so looker is like amazing if I still I'm like pretty techy and I it confuses the heck out of me so I hire someone work to build these but basically just make sure you have all of your data in one clean setup in a Google sheet in a HubSpot table just somewhere that's it's a table that it's clean so date name of person what the event was cly or an application when the call was when it was booked for like all the information you want a clean table and then all you need is just ask someone to looker like I want this that it auto toggles across this range across this date uh you know for this so we use this for sales commission dashboards we use this for um Setter ones that we're building right now and that we in the past uh we use it for coaching um commission payments and stuff we do different things for retention uh any of those like live dashboards to incentivize and then all the other stuff um I like to personally build and touch and those are all in sheets so again not the most beautiful thing and just goes to show like we're still cranking on Google Sheets like no other um we use Google Sheets for cash flow management statement which is like the lifeblood it's like the it's the p&l it's the everything in everything out and then all the marketing metrics and all the Fulfillment metrics basic in one um so I use Google Sheets for all those and then sales dashboard for sales operations management uh marketing dashboard for marketing management essentially um owner level dashboard that includes everything down to like net income which is really cash flow um and then uh there's another one operations same thing kind like a mid-level one that includes a lot of those stats CS has one and something else so basically each one has their own and then they all are in sheets I have a zap that'll go pull by day 7 a.m. call it take a screenshot automatically of that dashboard on Google Sheets or looker wherever and then drop it into the relevant Channel and tag everyone so it's like you know basically do you see the numbers here's yesterday versus here's where we're at month to date uh here's where we're at quarter to date here's where at year to date and then here's in comparison to the past so last quarter versus last year versus and then green or red if it's up or down um so that's a big one for us dashboards um here how do I do this hyos uh so so we used hyros for the last like four years and we technically still have it on so we have all the parameters on and AD tracking um this becomes really important when you have multiple sources so you know you have Google you have YouTube you have or whatever you mean Google is all one but Google YouTube um Facebook Instagram meta allinone um email traffic all of that and we basically attach parameters in organic and it's a really big one for organic if you want to like put on your YouTube uh tracking link that you know where they came from on that uh it's basically Source tracking and then because we do call funnels it's 14 days on average from lead to close and then three or four from app and then you know two to three from call so it's important because they doing offline conversion is what it's called so the because they are taking the information over the phone the sales is putting in the information checking them out uh the ad platforms the tracking the whatever can't see that person checking out and know it's them because they're not actually on their computer or on their phone or whatever buying so we have some pretty cool stuff set up here where we used to use highest for a long time and then we went full custom I don't have the link for the other guys but we use um Dr UTM in current form and we're kind of testing to see how that goes so basically we have it set up so the stuff that's happening on the browser and the server match and it is capturing everything into HubSpot instead of into hyos it's doing both really but it's capturing it into hyos and it's doing it into HubSpot into our CRM and holding all those information of like the ad click when um all the stuff around you know user agent IP all the stuff we can capture um and then it is pushing those back in when they happen so for us right now we only track lead schedule submit app and purchase so all of the actual native Facebook events um we push back on those and then for purchase the big one the big difference there in my eyes at least is the custom one that we have set up allows us to set up the purchase to trigger on when they sign the terms so big thing there for terms is it's one purchase so like if you have a 10K product sometimes people are going to pay 5 K 5K sometimes people are going to pay 7200 and then put 2,800 or whatever on another card they're going to do these different split pays and sometimes hyros can get wony and if you don't have like a billing manager or someone in there running it and stripe handling everything here on custom and then also putting it into going into hyos and like combining events and doing all that then it can become an issue like that in that example it would show two different sales that came through fire back to the pixel and it would show in the in the extension and there too versus what we're doing is we set it up on the terms so the terms has double benefit because one you only have one submission per person it can then go into HubSpot pull the deal value put it back in and submit it and this is all custom set up through these guys and then the other big one is it's browser and server right because the uh client is actually going to the site filling out all the information and then submitting so that is acting as the purchase where someone can you know what I mean because it'll fire for the first and it'll fire for the second on hyros it'll only fire for one purchase with the full amount and the persons in the browser so you get the browser side and then server side we fire on our own so they match versus hyos is as close as you can get like out of the box um but takes a little bit more beef so yeah that's what we do for ad tracking right now membership portal um this is where I kind of start to lean I was leaning into fulfillment a little bit we use kajabi for the info products we used to sell and then also for all of our free products we have so anything um if you watch some of the other videos I talk about how we have at the end it's like if you stay at the end of the vssl you can get these free bonuses and these free gifts if you do that they basically go to the different Landers for different kajabi products and then they can pick which one they want so they want menopause they want alt guide or macronutrients they want these so we use kajabi for this and then the whole theme in the back end is push for Ascension to have them book a call or apply book a call and talk to someone to ascend up to the higher ticket um but I've had great success with kajabi I just don't use it for Community ever uh I don't think there even is community but um maybe there is now but Community this one is everyone has a different answer uh so for us our Target demo I think that is completely dependent on who your target demo is so for us ours is 40 to 6-y old women where are 40 to 6-y old women Facebook right so like we're obviously going to run ours in Facebook there are like fantastic ones if you're in make money online or if you're like uh uh information about trading or if you're um Fitness even kind of like can have their own buckets uh but you basically want to go where you're going to get get the highest engagement that's the whole point of it right is to make it so people are actually active in there they get value out of it out of it if you're in a recurring thing they stay for Community they feel like they're in one um so is a really good one I've heard um works with these guys on some stuff but but again it just doesn't really feel to me like the thing that my 46y old women would be want to be on um I've heard good things about Circle I really am not a fan at all but I've heard good things about Circle cuz this is like courses communities all that school obviously um if you're in this space you likely know school but these guys have everything in here feels a little bit like outdated like I just feel like communities you just have to go where people are so like if all the internet marketer guys are in here then yeah it's going to work um but like Facebook all the 46y old women are there so it works so that's what we currently use uh it's just Facebook group for that reviews we do it everywhere so trust pilot is where we collect here I'll just do this trust pilot so we do this we don't pay for this yet it's like you know5 or $600 a month which is just crazy it's like based on how many people are on your team um but we use trust pilot as like the main one just because we try and like aggregate them all in one but what we will do is run one of these every couple months and we push them here so we're basically like these are the core ones that are important to us these the core ones that rank uh and the whole goal is like if you've had a success if you've had success if you have like a positive experience we want you to share youreview because these are the number one factor in other people um seeing and actually want to join and you know get results as well um so BBB is a big one in our space uh trust pilot is just overall big one Facebook page Google review and then this is the other one I want to show you so we use testimonial. and it allows us to like standardize I think we got this from hormos I want to say Leila or hor Moi I believe um but they use this or someone use this I don't know that they use this but uh we got it from someone and uh it allows you to basically like have the questions pre-baked record the video right here have it more or less as standardized as you can and that's actually where we collected all of these from is using these video reviews is using that site having them all go into one approve them and then do that so a fun one for reviews kind of side tangent but we used uh we basically know I mean you know your cost for fulfillment so if it costs you whatever call it two grand a year for a coach or a th000 bucks a year for a coach to fill in the product um we know that if you want to give away six months it's cost you 500 bucks right and basically in hard cost in real cost if you have just like an info Community doesn't cost you anything um but for us we're like okay cool let's offer six months as a added or four months or two months or whatever you want to add and then have them submit all these things do it in a big giveaway and we're going to give it away to someone and then that was a nice one that did a nice push for us uh ovens did a really really good one in the past where he did uh basically rolled out like a 2.0 version of one of his products and was like you all get it all you have to do is submit a review first and like gated it and then every new buyer just got 2.0 and then all the people who were in The Core won it's like this is what you paid for but I will give you this for free if you submit reviews and he had like thousands of reviews over that time from the transfer so that was a really cool way to like collect reviews um and then same thing with when someone ranks NPS n or above it just routes them to there when someone just generally in general has a good feedback the coach will push them to there so yeah review collection is huge and then AI agents um we use an open AI setup right now that and like on laying chain I don't custom build this uh myself anymore um we have a senior Tech lead who's a phenomenal at this on the team but we use AI agents for a couple different pieces some of them are just like simple like AI agents but they're basically just using a app to just push information in and out uh we do use it for customized um stuff around Tech so like ingesting application information and making Uh custom uh responses there that occur so basically it'll be like without saying but like based on your application I think these are resources you'll be interested in or oh you know I can see that youve struggle with XYZ and are interested in this or you think that you are skinny fat in current state and your goal is to be you know shredded or you know like these different things um it can use that information and then tailor the conversation to them and then tailor resources it gives them uh as well as just like overall guiding them U so yeah so that those are the different AI agents pieces I can go like way in depth on this but I don't really want to go go over another Mar 25 minutes I didn't mean to um so yeah I'm going to make these videos kind of like this for now and then over time I feel like it'll probably be better if I can centralize them into one bigger piece it will just be hours and hours long um so the goal of this is just to share what we're doing and just share what has worked and what has not like AI agents we used to use one of the tools that was out of the box and use one that we paid like five grand for and then we built it in house and it cost us like 120 bucks a month to run instead of like mid thousands and we have full control and to change it whenever we want have like full customization so yeah uh I'm sure I'm missing a ton so these are just the quick ones off the top that I rattled off and wanted to share cuz I'm trying to do one of these every day and yeah if you have any other questions at all uh feel fre to drop a comment and I am more than happy to go into any detail about any of these I just need to figure out a good way to share with you guys like the actual application routing and all that stuff or how we have like custom Fields set up in the CRM like there's so much gold in some of these pieces I just don't know how to share those in a good way that will not give away like customer information or like just private information I'm more than happy to share anything I just don't want to give away someone else's stuff because that's just like not fair to them so yeah um I will talk to you guys soon and connect with me on Instagram if you want to have chat that's the easiest way to contact me so talk soon bye

# The Email & SMS Automations Behind a $70M Call Funnel (Steal This) | E3
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ8X2TxqmSs

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the vssl call funnel contextual automations that we use to do 70 million in one funnel all right um so contextual meaning the communication automation so none of the tech and pushing zaps data from here to here is just going to be where we do communication so email SMS calling um stuff like that later videos I can have the other stuff um and as always the videos here are basically just me showing what has worked for us what has not worked and we've changed um and this exact sequence and evolution to this sequence is how we did 70 million just through one funnel and one setup so first things first I have other videos on the channel where I go through the actual pages of these so I'm going to quick do that uh as I talk about these but you can see that on the channel um so first things first someone's going to opt in when they come to the optin page we're just going to collect their name and email so we have tried with phone number in the past um but for us it didn't make sense because we weren't hitting the leads on time we didn't have proper Setters AI wasn't where it was when we tested it last um to be able to have uh basically get more value out of less leads cuz it was whatever it was 25 30% drop um to get more value out of the emails with phone then just emails at a higher volume okay so still to this day we only do name and email so first things first they're going to get an email that says here's your training you know basically click back here to go this is what you opted in for here's it via email okay then after around 25 minutes which is how long the vssl is right here ish in the video oh they are going to have a uh cookie timer like popup CTA here and at that same time um based on which video they're on they're going to get an email that is going to give them bonuses okay so in the beginning of the vssl we use and for all the Frameworks we've used thus far it's basically says if you save the end I'm going to give you XYZ bonus okay everyone gets this email no matter if they actually stay at that length or not so it's just hardcoded in there to send at 25 or whatever the CTA timing of the video is 25 27 minutes whatever um and it sends them bonuses via email okay the page they go to for this is this and this is important because instead of just sending them the email that says here's your bonus and they click on it we send them to this page and because we offer I believe four different bonuses at this time they will go to this page and it's Force consumption so over 80% of our traffic is on mobile so again I made a video on this I have to make this prettier my my Dev is doing it now but um so they have to do consumption through this so they go oh cool I'm going to claim my bonuses via email so they go to their email for it you get higher open rates pass it back higher email sender reputation all that stuff because they're opening and clicking on these emails the first ones they're going to go and have to consume through this to get to the bonuses at the bottom they have to look at testimonials okay whole time then bonuses are below so here's one two three four bonuses that they can claim right so that email is huge that one gets Great Click rates um and then once they go into these each one of these is own dedicated place they can claim it so they don't just get everything it has more micro commitments as they go they have to go to the page to find it they have to click through here they have to give give the information so we know who claimed which ones not just blanket give the offer to everyone because then you can't track which one uh you know let's say you have thousand leads come through and 400 of them are in one bucket and then it's like 200 200 whatever right breakout so you'll know that that one is clearly more your buyer demo or how you're running ads right now they're more interested in macronutrients versus menopause versus whatever right and then you can see from which ones get this which ones apply book a call buy right so which is important that you have those tracking of those commitments throughout going off pays a little bit but they get this email here then from there they are in a flow that is contextual all we call this push to app so this one we're going to call push to app this one push to book and this one booking confirmed right they're kind of like the three main buckets in here now they're basically just going to get value ads so the whole beauty of why we set up our website the way we did was so that when people go to the site they're just constantly consuming so we will then send just value every day that is you know truth about sugar cravings for 40 so they'll see this and generally we actually send them to the watch Pages because that seems to convert better so this will be in an email that's right after a day later they'll see this and then they'll consume more content and the CTA everywhere is apply now which is the next step right because they're in the opin The Next Step In The Funnel is for them to apply so this pushes them to there just through content and through consumption because again you have someone who's on ad and then by the time they get on the phone you're trying to sell them something that's 5 10 20K whatever they need need to have consumption not just see an ad and then get on the phone to buy like there just doesn't make sense that way so everything we do is Value First in this way with of course called actions to apply but very value first and then on top of that everybody in the this list and then anybody who's on like a 90day I believe it's 90 right now 90day click and 60-day open I believe is what we're running maybe 30-day open is in a big list that gets twice a day campaigns they are the exact same thing that are value value pushing them to the website consume content consume content and then the the site itself does the ctas to push them to app so one step at a time um and then yeah so these are really important and same thing when we drop new YouTube videos the new YouTube video goes live on the page goes onto the website once it's on the website goes over the copywriting team and then uh the copywriters send this out in or like email manager um sends these out so that then you get the instant uh views you get to grow that in that way and it's always fresh content and then they will recycle as top performers but twice a day emails every day and right now the list is like 100 something that fit in that criteria that we sent out so this is like bread and butter and not can have other videos where I go through like kpis and stats of this um but quick numbers let's say you have a thousand opt-ins on that you'll get 250 apps maybe that's rough numbers kind of depends sometimes it can be low and it can be like 13 but it varies but so just in terms of the communication uh flows then someone applies all right so when someone applies they fill out here and they will collect we collect what 17 questions and that includes name email and phone number is the first time we get phone number for them so now this opens up that we can call them and we can text them right these have direct opt-ins consent and all that kind of stuff for compliance and throughout this we are gathering what they currently are where they currently are sitting what they can't do what they tried to do all those things and Gathering all this information across this and this is important for the next part so first thing this is actually above the app we have it so if someone lands on the application page but does not do it we track them in HubSpot with the page view and then we wait x amount of time and if they haven't submitted an app we push back almost like an abandoned cart you do an Ecom that's like oh I saw you tried to apply but you didn't like what's stopping you style and much better copyrighting I'm not a copywriter by any means um team is 10 times better me than that but this is the fun one that we just rolled out within the last month or so that's starting to pick up some steam and get uh it gets really high rates um and then obviously getting applications and bookings which then turns so but the app not booked contextual content and email so this one now is going to them that is just more contextual for uh instead the ctas if there are any if it's not just value first then they will say book a call right so the first couple are very hot against that that's like hey you applied you didn't book a call hey you applied you didn't book a call and then the rest are basically just like more intentful content that's still with the CTA though book a call okay then this is the fun one so we have never had Setters we've tried it oh not never because we've tried it and we didn't have the right people in place we didn't have the right management in place systems whatever you want to call it it just did not work for us so to date everything that we've done for this call funnel is literally app booking straight to closer so no Setters no CRM nurture we have however however many a million and some change contacts in HubSpot um and we don't call outbound we don't nurture we don't like if someone falls off they fall off so like in current state we'll sell 1% of our leads for every 100 optins we get one unit so there's 99 people that land in you know what's called 30 of them apply 15 of them book a call like is in that range and all the other and even those they don't buy 1% buy and we have nothing else to sell them so I'm excited to do these videos because I'll be able to look back on this and be like oh I can't believe we did that and you know thankfully we got it to work to the scale we did but now Setters now Load Ticket all these different pieces because we could sell another 30% of those leads on Load Ticket we could have Setters and double from one to or triple from 1 to 3% if we just nurtured better so okay side tag in but true so Mandy AI SMS so we actually have a uh AI agent that we custom built so we initially used a software not on name names but we used one that was out of the box that basically grabs somebody who applies Waits 7 minutes and if they don't book starts a text communication AI chat okay and all text based because calling still in March of 2025 does not work with AI in a clean way that doesn't sound like Ai and can navigate properly so through SMS it is now going to send them so we built a custom one in-house for hundreds of dollars not tens of thousands to run it um or high thousands to run it so basically what this will do is it'll ingest all of their application information it knows already everything about us and how messaging has worked and trained based on what has converted in the past has all that and then takes the person's contextual application information that they've tried keto they've tried Jenny CRA they've done XYZ their goal is to not be this they think they're skinny fat um they want this they're this age bracket they this income like these different things in this and it feeds that all in so that then it can have a conversation with them and be like hey I saw you did this but not this and try to push and I can go through messaging on that later um on the specifics of it but essentially it is navigating back and forth conversation has reminders in place to hey like where'd you go send the gifts do the whole thing um and that right now collects 11% or so of our bookings in a week so if we get a th000 bookings 110 or so had conversations with Mandy which is our AI agent and then ended up booking a call in current state all we do with them is uh direct push them to a link to book that's then tracked we have we're testing a little bit with having um Dynamic back and forth where it can like look at a calendar say oh are you available at this time they can say yes and it can create the auto booking but just because of the tracking stuff in the back end it's a little harder so we keeping it simple right now and then the other thing it does um and I didn't even build this which is amazing someone on our team our senior Tech leader is a badass and he built this out but we then have like a database that has all of the resources on the site so it can say okay this woman is interested in this this this and this it can find then the link from something on the site and push them a Content piece that says oh I think you'd like this oh I think this video this read page this uh podcast would be interesting to you based on your application okay so just more personalization customization that you could easily do a Setters but because we didn't have at the time and this runs 247 and right so this is really cool and just further development like this week we're what day is it Saturday today or tomorrow we're going to be live at Blue so we're going to try uh one of the blue sending platforms to make it so it looks like or it can communicate like iMessage because a large majority of ours are iMessage as well so instead of sending green bubbles supposedly you get 20% uh I'm sorry 2x 200% um which I gu said 100% but you get uh 2x the response rates which is crazy because that could just directly double and we could get another 150 bookings a week we can get another 20 a day potentially so that'd be cool based on what we've seen so all we all we're doing there is changing the conduit so instead of having the content delivered through green the same exact AI content is delivered through blue so going to test that out this week and I will report back and then the booking one my absolute least favorite and the one that just like irks my soul um oh actually another one that comes in here is we then push the freebies so we push push out individual emails for the uh free products that they get if they St at the end of the vsl they already have them likely but each one is in a dedicated email just to like because they're almost across the Finish Line it's like here consume more content here take this free thing here's more value so we do that in there as well forgot and that's via email um all right so the booking we have wrestled with this non-stop non-stop non-stop so again because we do not use Setters the pain here is show rates so for the longest time it was literally just like the calendly booking whatever automated things branded email from HubSpot and then get on the calendar and we had 40 50 60% show rates call it in there they would tank down they'd be 40 because we'd break something like it was just a nightmare so as of recent with the what I'm about to share is we're at like 55% show rates we just changed something and like for last week it's been like 45% and because we don't have Setters or any of these things doing calls it's literally just add basically straight to booking obviously there's consumption you have the really quality people that come through but a majority is not so 55 to 60 is like the best we've ever had for a sustained amount of time we've been in 70s and stuff but just like never sustained because based on the traffic quality and it scale um but this is what we currently have set up that were fingers crossed we were homing at around 55% and hopefully we can go 55 60% and then we're going to roll in Setters and hopefully go like 70 so first things first is they get a calendar invite we use cly still to this day so round robin and kly they get a calendar invite inv that you know basically approve this approve this they have gone through this page to do so and they can only book in a 48 hour window okay so this out to 48 hours so if it's 12 right now they can only book until 12 two days from now all right all we collect is this then in here it's going to say if there's no suitable times available for you go to here and we have a custom booking time request so we took this from somebody we funnel hacked somebody and took this but this is brilliant and these pop into a sales hot leads channel that sits in there and like basically um allows someone to be like oh I can do in three days or oh can you reach out to me in a week or something like that so it lets you m grab opportunities that you may have missed and then same thing sometimes kly bugs out and this just goes here um I don't know we sold this from someone too but so they go here then they're going to land on this page okay this is post booking and what we tell them so get ready we're going to text you whatever we're going to call you from a 610 number which is the area code that we use for the phone numbers we call from and then it's going to be on on a zoom uh make sure you're on a computer watch this video preframe video look at these testimonials and then watch these reviews all right so going back to this first thing they're going to get is a calendar invite and land on that page right then an email is going to come from the sales rep dynamically that it was assigned to through cley so from HubSpot it's going to send them an email that's going to say Hey you know basically like scarcity is like qualification hey there was 2,000 applications you're somebody who qualified congratulations but here's what you need to do before the call first things first like go to this page watch these videos consume this like do this and we're pointing them all back to that page I just showed you the scheduled success page so in there um we just constantly optimize and push towards there then the next one is a call confirmation so the second someone books they go into a opportunities Channel and we have a 20 I think it's 20 hours right now 27 so 7 days a week 20 hours a day a call confirmation team that a second someone books into there they claim it they pop in HubSpot they dial the person and then if they don't answer they double dial and if they don't answer they leave a voicemail and an SMS and basically it's like hi I'm Rebecca from or hi you know Ryan I'm Rebecca from the warrior bab call confirmation team uh your booking is almost complete we just do this step here where we need to confirm and get like a verbal yes from you to say that yes you did mean uh to book for 5:30 Central Time right Central um and and you know it's Zoom call so like basically confirming time zone and then confirming that it's a zoom call not a phone call CU our Target demo is like 40 to 60 so sometimes there's a gap there and same thing with time zone that's just difficult sometimes for people especially if they're moving around so we confirm that there in current state we get 60% of our bookings that are claimed and that actually are like are claimed in a way that they say yes those people that then claim with someone have like a 70 something like 72% show rate versus not that have like 4050 so that's where our blank Ed 55 comes from is because it comes through um comes comes through the call confirmation Team all right so that's there and then I'll zip through these ones but because I'm going I didn't realize I was going so long um the sales rep 30 minute post so this is another AI infused message so it basically uses the Mandy Tech takes their application takes their info and says hi this is Ryan from The Warrior bab team I see you booked in with me tomorrow at 11:30 and uh based on what you saw like here's a resource that I thought might be helpful for you that I think you should watch before our call like talk soon okay so that comes out 30 minutes right after they book so it's like an initial touch point with the sales repe the entire time we send branded nurture emails leading up to their calls uh we did have this every two hours we got a couple people complaining that it was like frustrating to them that we kept emailing them so we changed it to four hours and then the last three on here is then uh 3 hours before simple couple bullet sales rep uh email that says hey be prepared for the call by doing this make sure you're in a quiet Place make sure that you have whatever you're ready for the call and all this then right before that 1 hour before an SMS from the sales rep that says hey so and so our calls in one hour here's your link simple and then I'm sorry that is the 30 minute before and then the one hour before automated comes from cly just says like another catch all and that's just cly this is an automated reminder no reply don't do it but your call is here and here's the link for it so that is the general gist I feel like I might be missing something here but it's pretty close too um so yeah let me know if you have any questions and again all I'm trying to do here is just share what we're doing what's worked for us and

# How Our STUPID Simple Funnel Made $70 Million | E2
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuYX_Ag4Px0

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the vssl call funnel overview so all the links and funnel pages and how they flow together um that we used to do $70 million in cash collected so whole goal of this uh is basically just to document and show what's working for us now uh we're constantly breaking things constantly room for improvement but this is what we have used um to do these numbers and kind of what we're adjusting and changing as these videos go on um and where we're optimizing so current state right now uh majority of our traffic comes from Facebook it's 85% or so of our spend on a daily basis um so you can see kind of all the ads here but a lot of video ads um with multiple brand faces now which is a new thing that we are testing um because for the longest time it was just uh One Singular brand face who's one of the co-founders of the company um and is in all the marketing assets so testing out right now different brand phases but essentially mainly Facebook traffic all going to an opt-in page okay so the vssl flow that we use is just first name email on opt then going to a vssl page I'll show you what this is in the bonus uh bonus and training replay so optin name email video sales letter application that's like 16 1 questions I'll show you booking page get on a zoom call all right so this is where they're opt in right now we just click name email then all the workflows behind them they'll then go to the actual vssl page these are constantly being split test so this is like a variation one for example or the control um so here's going to be the desktop version and then mobile is a vitic version so one's on wish we're actually changing that over right now because we heard that uh it has way higher clicks and better um better results when you use desktop so or I'm sorry when you use vitic on desktop uh so for that looping video but only about 10% of the traffic currently uh shows up on desktop and a majority of it is mobile so we're already pretty optimized there so I watch this There's a sticky CTA here or a cookie CTA that'll basically um pop up when they get to the uh CTA level of the video so it's like basically like 80 90% of the way through the video it'll pop up here and say click here to apply now x amount of limited spots they will end up on this page right here to apply this is also the main CTA that's all over our actual site so if you pop on to the actual site you'll see these apply Nows everywhere so this is the main call to action on the public side of the site we actually don't route them to the free training in current state we might change that up in the future um but currently every single apply now is going to bring you also to this page so so people can essentially enter here or here right so come through opt which is all of our traffic almost um all the paid traffic and then uh they can enter through here through organic through um just consumption based on the site so you're going to click through here I'm not going to go through the whole app but essentially the framing uh we got from alen sultanic which is taking them from like current state and then bringing them basically into state of pain so like state of like to get them in the frame that by the time they book a call they're realizing that they need help and they they can't do this on their own um so we collect a lot of good information through this um and then we also added newly somewhere in here we added a financial qualifier this is new to us so this probably only the last 5,000 or so applications we have where we're we're testing this based on routing um so this will say basically they say less than 1K depending on how much calendar availability it'll either allow them to book but not pixel Facebook um or send it back to the Facebook pixel or if they are um less than 1K depending and our calendars are full booked or like limited space uh it'll route them to a low ticket and just DQ them um but either way this does not cook the Facebook pixel which is an issue in thing that we Tred started probably two months ago uh that we've never had before so we've done like close to 400,000 applications through this and a variation of this form um so from there once they apply they then land on a booking page right here uh we're constantly split testing this with copy and the big thing we're testing here is not only the booking conversion rate so the app to booking percentage but we're also testing the uh actual backed out like r Revenue per booking that comes from each page because if you think if you have this zero friction then you're going to get more calls theoretically that are going to come through so you're going to have a higher conversion but maybe it's more Tire kickers just people who aren't as um uh who aren't as committed to this so all the micro commitments that we try and get throughout this process and like actually stop people um and add some friction so we do this on purpose um and then they come in they book a call and then once they're done booking a call they land on the success page and and we basically say hey we're going to call you from a 610 number we have a call confirmation team that's like 20 217 so they literally don't work three hours a day across the entire ever um so they call them and confirm them uh during working hours and then let them know to zoom make sure they're on uh that we're going to email and text them about it make sure that they're on a computer prior video check out these Transformations and then watch these reviews right and then all the email followup is constantly pushing them back to this so going back to this that's like the general direct flow right so someone could opt in they watch the vsl they apply they book a call and then there's the thank you page of the booking okay so the ones that are in between these are essentially used in uh both ads as well as an email followup we have a ton of email followup so like between this and this we'll have un applied I'm sorry an oped an opt no app workflow and then between this and this we'll have an app notbook workflow and then between booking and uh actual call we'll have a booking nurture workflow right so this is obviously going to be the biggest volume these are going to be contextual because now we have we can do SMS as well because we collect phone number for the first time in application um and then booking before the actual call nurture them with pre block just more consumption getting them to watch reviews um getting them to watch videos that are not directly saying XYZ objection but basically like getting it out of the way so um trying and get ahead of that versus it happening on the 30- minute Zoom call um but then yeah so these two pages right here says boning training replay page where did I click these there we go oops no I didn't let's just click on so this one so this is going to be what they get sent in email that um so basically if they watch the vssl it says hey if you stay until the end of the vsl we're going to give you all these free bonuses um then you have to claim in through your email so they open the email so you get higher s email goes up um because they open those and then they're linked over here to this bonus page where it's just says bonus at the bottom you push again the BSL that's right here so it like forces consumption especially on mobile um which again is like 85% of our traffic so this page is actually ugly I got to change that see constantly learning uh we just moved over to web flow so didn't see this but um coming down here they have to go through all these reviews basically see them before they get down here to see these different bonuses yeah like this is so ugly I didn't even know this but now we know um so in here they can then these are our main four buyer personas so the bonuses are in alignment with that so basically uh menopause uh hormonal style uh busy mom basically I don't have enough time stop over training the people who just try and like work out like crazy cardio bunny um and or just like overtrain in general and then back which is like the core one um a lot of the time that we use in our assets and also is like the most highly claimed so we push them here through email and then it's basically just like a retar is you could call it page that we are putting them back into so they claim their bonuses get more consumption all the bonuses are filled with you know apply here apply here Pages um or CT more so and then same with these pages right here um to always just constantly try and get them to apply okay so again this is going to exist in this opt no app workflow so as soon as they watch the vsl and opt in it waits the 25 30 minutes and it sends them this we'll actually instantly we send them an email and I'll go through another video actually on this that goes through all the different workflows but they will get the instant like hey you opted in here's your free training link and then after the 30 minutes or so we send it to everyone even not just the people who got to the end of the vsl because you can track that and it's we do track that but we just figure it's better to send to everyone so we send it to everyone that's watched uh or opted in for the vssl after the end time in the vssl we say oh hey here all your free bonuses thanks for watching blah blah blah and we send them this page right here um so that's there and then the other page I want to show you was the one that we used for retarget and we actually were using for a lot of the Google stuff for a while um we've never fully cracked Google working on that right now but the max we've ever spent there is like two to 4K a day maybe like even scaled up um and a lot of it's branded search branded camps stuff like that um we've never hit it on cold and never hit it on YouTube at scale so we're trying to do that now but we will use this page right here on retarget and then also sometimes so retarget on ads retarget in um or retarget whatever you want to call it nurture and emails and then we've been using that in Google a little bit um but again mainly for retarget and not so much cold so this is more of like a Al sultanic kind of vibe where um for the automatic clients like low ticket thing except for us it's just push into an application um so this is the longer form prettier page as you can see these are the newer pages are looking way better cuz we're constantly finding things like I need to change this now this is terrible so um but yeah so getting closer and closer to just a full branded nice design that goes through there so I'll go through other videos um that go deeper into the workflows and everything like that but again these videos are just to like show what we're doing um I found a video going back that was showing what we did when we were only doing 10ish million I think we'd only done like whatever 8 to 12 million in cash collected on this funnel and it's me going through and the platform Evolution and all that stuff and it's just like I wish I would have shared it cuz then we did 60 million through the updated version that I never up like shared so yeah um all things Tech tracking um systems automations team everything that's evolved since then I'm going to try and figure out a clean way to write it out and share it as here and then as we evolve because like right now one of the big things we're changing and we're pushing towards is like uh Setters we've never had Setters um low ticket and those two go in in uh in tandem kind of of like because you're going to have Setters uh take basically the implementation calls free otos that is on the back end of the load ticket so you're routing people through so then increase show rates increase quality um as well as obviously quality because they're a low ticket so they've already become a purchaser versus a lead so we've never done stuff like this a scale um and we keep hearing that this is crazy M crazy uh math to have gotten to at these rates without doing all these things that we didn't even know really were a thing uh for our maret market so or didn't really think to do and want to change Focus so yeah that's kind of the goal is uh just document what we're doing uh as of date currently today in March of 2025 we are only running this vssl funnel still um and then we're like a week or two out from having Setters having um low ticket that we're going to start testing and then some other kind of fun stuff so um yeah that is just the general gist and letm know if you have any questions and I'll just keep making these videos document what we're doing for me me and forever else for anyone else thanks

# How Our Website Evolved to Scale From $0 to $30M/Year | E1
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6y1pFRv4y4

what's up everybody all right so today I'm going to go through the platform and off Revolution that we use to do 70 million in cash collected on a call funnel um so not Revenue cash collected and I found a video of myself doing this uh when we were at about this phase right here and we had done about 10 million in cash collected so since then we've done about 60 million um between these two so um today just going to go over basically the offer we're running and the website funnelish but mainly the website that we were using at the time so future videos we'll have different pieces of operations team Tech scaling how we've done everything and then basically just like what's working now as we evolve because there's a bunch of big changes actually happening right now to bring us into a new level more or less um but I'm going to go through kind of where we came from in regards to this so initially we're running a $27 a month app um so it was a 7-Day free trial and then push into a 7day I'm sorry a yeah free 7-Day trial $27 a month there's an OT for $147 um and this was really popular at the time to do and Facebook costs were slowly increasing but people were trying to make it work long story short is we were not uh we were doing like 30k day or I'm sorry 30k a month uh in and out so it was not good um So eventually we were like all right let's move this thing over to a call funnel um and from there we moved over to Wordpress um so this is basically it's had some weird update since but this is basically what we were running so at this time this was more of an oven model model um and had all focus on consumption so it was all about reviews it was all about uh what can they consume prior to getting on the sales call um so that we have a higher chance of doing so so at this time right we had just evolved from this and gone into vssl call funnel so at the time it's optin watch vssl application book a call thank you page and then all the emails and all the things behind there pushing them to consume before we then pitch them on the phone right because all these are coming from cold ad and with a mid to high ticket thing you definitely want them to have consumption so the calls aren't just you know at 5% all in all sales per booking so at the time uh this offer was an info product so it was kajabi hosted course it had group coaching calls and a community so very simple classic stack and we started off by testing at 497 and this was five years ago maybe now at this point four or five years ago so so tested at 497 and started doing 80k months then 100K then 200 and something then 400 and just like up to the right so this is how we hit our first million dollar months is right here um so that was all on this platform using Wordpress um and again the text doesn't actually matter which is the funny part like the website doesn't matter you could do it on clickfunnels you could do it on webflow um this is just what we used at the time because for us it was like oh we want really want to push resources and have content heavy so that there's more or less like a flywheel they can just exist on um so this side's a little slower now because it's on like a backup version um but essentially this was the gist right is like finally have things that have ctas on them like you know sticky ctas and just like longer form pushed consumption with just when they're done they roll into the next thing so this is the site that we used to do 60 something million right here so it looked a little prettier since like broken with plugins and stuff but it was rough it was rough no doubt so uh the actual funnel itself is also on here so on just Standalone pages so the opt uh vsls app booking and thank you are on here just on the back of the site or on you know solo Pages not necessarily linked out from the front um but yeah so this is kind of the the gist so over that time um we went to this and then we actually added in these two as well while still on WordPress okay so the offer changed but then the entire platform stayed the same because it didn't need to so it was really even close to the same vsl and the same style we just changed what we were selling and that alone was like right there uptick because we had never gotten over I believe one probably like 1.2 maybe is selling the uh info product and it was one time access so margin was good in terms of no fulfillment but margin was not good in terms of no retention no future money and the ticket being lower right so we decided to transition over to one to one coaching so at that time when we moved over to one toone coaching we really had like a skeleton team of like actual coaches to fulfill on it um so it was us in the background doing it um and mainly the brandace and founder at the time uh was leading that department but so over time this took over the entire company so this became like only thing we could sell only thing we would sell and we got rid of this info product and completely just phased it out we transitioned over this this is when we started doing one two three almost four we never we never hit four as of whatever it is March 25 uh we haven't hit four a month yet but we were steady state in that range and across that time we used to sell this for like $300 a month it was crazy um and then over that time we've just transitioned out so it's annual only recurring programs um thumbs up uh it's annual only recurring programs it is $7,200 a year in current form with financing options that would make it more than $7,200 uh inhouse so you know like three pays two pays stuff like that and then we also have external financing where you just throw 1,000 bucks on on top of the ticket just because you have to cover feed and do all that kind of stuff so yeah it's the general gist and then this is where we transition to as of 2025 early and this is much more the feel of what we're going for so this is branded like no other this is the style we want all the graphics everything is up to date um The Funnel itself is actually also on here on the back end um but yeah so the whole like got just like this crazy overhaul so same goal and same idea just for the better look right so consumption very focused on keeping people in this flywheel of being able to you know they call that flywheel but you understand what I mean um in the blog so that they can just keep consuming content we have macros mindset andopa muscles and then each one's broken down by reads and watches so all the YouTube videos end up on here like but this is just a classic example working we're constantly changing things video description here is is terrible for search so we're rebuilding these um with AI to have like full proper headlines sub headlines and information based on transcripts throughout these videos because we have so much content um and then yeah CTA all throughout all pushing to apply and then this is where they enter basically middle of funnel so um which at some levels top of funnel but so add optin vssl application this is that application so people who are already on the site idea being they have as much consumption at some level and they could come in here directly so yeah so then they apply book a phone call and then all future videos where we have like crazy stuff for routing and qualifications and going to sets here soon versus going to closers directly and all that kind of jazz but yeah so that's kind of the general gist and then the other piece of the set I did want to show because it's very important uh or has a ton of views is this review section so we broke the reviews into Transformations which is basically images of before and afters and then um video reviews which this is generally speaking the highest performing part of the site and these are just popups with different videos we try and get them all in one format but it's a little tough uh with the market to get them all consistent but yeah so these are the most highly trafficked portion of the website and then also the highest converting and then client interviews this is where we're putting a lot of effort in just for more consumption with the same output or with the same style right so it's like literally women directly going through their exact Journey um and the ones that get feed on these end up becoming clients right so like if someone watches these and watches a handful of them and assuming they check XYZ box and they're good fit and now we're actually going to like allow them into the program then um they buy like almost every time so but funny enough on this just a quick little thing I did a like a long split test of this page versus this page or just having this is the default versus this is the default and this one outperformed by almost double so people being able to come in here and get quick feedback on this and then lead into doing an application which is what we were optimizing for at the time so basically if they come from search if they come from so branded search paid or um just kind of some of the other pieces like an email and retargeting if they come to this page and it's this versus this it is double the amount of people then went into application book a call and then purchase right you just got to assume the downflow so yeah pretty cool um but this is a Non-Stop Evolution um we still use we don't use WordPress for anything we still use click funnels for order forms that's what it all about that's why we do that uh which isn't really the best necessarily um but we use it for all the sales rep order fors but yeah so that's kind of the general gist and much much much more to come um I agreed that I would go through and start sharing all the stuff like as we build uh I found a bunch of old videos earlier this month that were basically me doing this but just never publishing them and going through them and I wish I would have because again we had done five million when I started making first ones and then 10 and then we just jumped to 70 basically and with the new Evolution where I'll be able to talk on soon but we've never done anything low ticket like direct with at scale we did very initial so low ticket mid ticket so either direct to cart uh webinar flows challenge flows and then having all that more or less on the front end of the company with this on the back end so yeah it'll be fun Evolution and I look forward to the update where I can have three digits here and some other fun stuff so hopefully three digits a year so that's the target but yeah uh feel free to comment or message me anywhere and uh I'm just going to keep posting these of different pieces of tech operations sales just growth overall and like what we're doing now and what we've done past so enjoy

# How We Automate Sales Team Commissions
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTVfK4-CzWQ

alrighty so i get this question a lot when it comes to how to run basically a remote sales team commission um and keep it clean without having to do any like manual spreadsheet tracking or anything like that and more importantly to track the life cycle of the customer especially when it comes to refunds and everything like that so we use clickfunnels actually for our order forms so you can see here we have a bunch of different sales people and you can see that we just set basically a funnel step to each salesperson so this is my order form for example so you can find it with my ryan's link we set the page level just as the same as a two one whatever it is so let's say we're to go to luke's you would see luke has his own order form on his own funnel stuff with his own name um so you do have to duplicate the products you have to create them on each layer separately but for this example let's say we're just using mine so what we do to track it um so this person so for this example so when i sell over the phone or i send out my order form to a prospective client when they pay i need to get commissioned for that and i need to get tracked for that so we actually go into zap do everything through zap all of our stuff happens within stripe so i'll set up a zap and it'll be when a new successful purchase comes through that funnel with that funnel step so my funnel step it'll grab the data it'll then go into our slack channel go into our purchases slack channel and send send a channel message that is you know we do woohoo new purchase we put my name hard coded hard typed into here and then we have this as the fields that come from there so we can say who was the purchase so we have these set up for each sales person its own full zap flow for each person so it sends that message and then this is the cool part so then we actually go into the stripe account you just link up your stripe account we do find a customer we find the customer buy that contact email that came the click funnels you'll see right here so we basically just go into here and we just click contact email so now you're going to filter by you're going to find a customer in stripe you're going to go down here and you're actually going to update the customer then and because you actually in this have to search it by the customer's id so where you find that is actually once you find the customer it spits out what the customer id is and that's going to be that cus underscore so you find the customer then there and then you leave their name leave their email and we update the description to include my number um so i'm agent id or a salesperson id number four you technically put my name in here you could whatever you guys want so like let's say i just want to do it like this but we actually just do numbers just so it's easy to track and so it's easy to use and manipulate in excel so i update it with the description of me as four and that's it so i'll turn that on so basically just in recap we create an order form at its own funnel step with my name specific to me so i'm the only person who's ever going to check out on that form because i'm going to get credit so when a new purchase occurs it's successful on that funnel step it's going to message into our slack channel into our purchases and say awesome ryan got a sale so we can kind of keep the hype up amongst the sales people that who's getting sales find that customer by their email address that came through here and then once you find that customer it spits out the customer id which is that cus underscore number and then you're going to go under here and you're going to update their description with my number so why this is so valuable and important is because let's say i sell 10 000 worth of stuff today or this week within our seven day pay period and three days from now somebody refunds a thousand dollars worth you don't want to you want to be able to know that that refund was my sale so now you're gonna have ten thousand dollars in revenue you're gonna have a thousand dollars in refunds so my net at the end of the week is only going to be nine thousand and the beauty of this is it carries over forever so that customer is now updated to my number so let's say they do it in three weeks or five weeks and in five weeks i have 20 000 a week but a refund happened from x amount of weeks ago it'll still deduct it so you're always just paying your sales people on the net revenue of their cash collected so this way it keeps them accountable keeps you accountable to know kind of all your numbers and make sure that you're not getting you know back tailed or anything like that so yeah there's just a general flow we use so click funnels order form write in send slack find the customer update and then yeah you just go into stripe click on that little export button in the top right on the payments tab and then run it for a pay period drop that into a pivot table and you're good to go so it's a super easy way to automatically track your sales people cash collected minus refunds
