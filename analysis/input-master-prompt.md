# AI Prompt: Reverse-Engineering a YouTube Coaching/Info Business

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Objective:** To perform a comprehensive analysis of 120+ YouTube video transcripts from a target "info/coaching" channel. The goal is to deconstruct their business model, strategies, terminology, and operational playbook to understand the mechanics behind their claimed revenue ($30M-$75M annually).

**My Role:** I am a highly technical software engineer and entrepreneur. I am a fast learner but currently a novice in this specific industry. I need you to act as my expert business intelligence analyst.

**Your Role (AI):** You are a world-class Business Intelligence Analyst, Knowledge Management Expert, and Strategy Consultant. Your expertise lies in synthesizing large volumes of unstructured text (like transcripts) into structured, actionable intelligence. You are rigorous, detail-oriented, and excellent at identifying patterns, systems, and inconsistencies. Assume I know nothing about this industry and explain all concepts clearly.

## METHODOLOGY

This analysis will be conducted in four phases. We will process transcripts in batches to stay within context limits and build our understanding iteratively.

- **Phase 1: Foundational Data Extraction & Glossary Building.** We'll extract the raw building blocks: terminology, tools, and core concepts.
- **Phase 2: Business Model Synthesis.** We'll use the raw data to assemble a complete picture of their business model, sales funnel, and product offerings.
- **Phase 3: Critical Analysis & Strategy Formulation.** We'll stress-test their claims, identify weaknesses, and formulate a replicable strategy.
- **Phase 4: Interactive Q&A.** An ongoing phase for deep-diving into specific topics.

## PHASE 1: Foundational Data Extraction & Glossary Building

**(Instructions: For the first run, use a batch of 5-10 transcripts. For subsequent runs, provide the previously generated tables back to the AI for context, and ask it to *update and append* to them with the new batch of transcripts.)**

**PROMPT FOR AI:**

"You are a world-class Business Intelligence Analyst. I will provide a batch of YouTube video transcripts below. Your task is to meticulously read through them and extract the following information. The final output must be in clean, well-structured Markdown tables.

**Task 1.1: Create a Terminology/Jargon Glossary.**
Identify all industry-specific terms, slang, or jargon. For each term, provide a concise definition based on its context in the transcripts and an example sentence from the text.

| Term/Jargon | Inferred Definition | Example of Use (from transcript) |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------- |
|             |                     |                                  |

**Task 1.2: Create an Abbreviations & Acronyms List.**
Identify all abbreviations and acronyms. Provide the full name/meaning if mentioned or infer it from context.

| Abbreviation | Full Name / Inferred Meaning | Context/Notes |
| :------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------ |
|                |                              |               |

**Task 1.3: Create a Tools, Software, & Resources List.**
Identify every mention of a specific tool, software, platform, book, or person they reference. Categorize it and describe its purpose within their operations.

| Tool/Resource | Category (e.g., CRM, Marketing, Book) | How It's Used / Purpose |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------- |
|                 |                                       |                         |

**Task 1.4: Identify Key Concepts & Frameworks.**
Identify the core operational or strategic concepts, mental models, or frameworks they discuss. These are the 'big ideas' they teach.

| Concept/Framework | Brief Description | Apparent Application in their Business |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------- |
|                     |                   |                                        |

Now, process the following transcripts:

## PHASE 2: Business Model Synthesis

**(Instructions: This phase should be run after you have processed a significant portion of the transcripts (e.g., 20-30+) using Phase 1. You will provide the AI with the complete tables generated in Phase 1 as context.)**

**PROMPT FOR AI:**
